Title = {Individual and mixture associations of perfluoroalkyl substances on
   liver function biomarkers in the Canadian Health Measures Survey},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},

Abstract = {Background Perfluoroalkyl substances can disrupt hepatic metabolism and
   may be associated with liver function biomarkers. We examined individual
   and mixture associations of PFAS on liver function biomarkers in a
   representative sample of Canadian adults. We explored the potential for
   effect modification by sex and body mass index, as well as by physical
   activity level which may attenuate the deleterious effect of PFAS on
   metabolic disorders. Methods We analyzed data from participants aged
   20-74 from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. We used linear
   regression to examine associations between plasma concentrations of
   PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUDA on serum concentrations of
   aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT),
   alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total
   bilirubin. We used quantile g-computation to estimate associations with
   a PFAS mixture for each simultaneous, one-quartile change in PFAS
   concentrations. Results Each doubling of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, or PFNA
   concentrations was associated with higher AST, GGT, and ALP
   concentrations. Each doubling of PFOA concentrations was associated with
   16.5\% (95\%CI: 10.4, 23.0) higher GGT concentrations among adults not
   meeting Canada's physical activity guidelines vs. 6.6\% (95\%CI: -1.6,
   15.5) among those meeting these guidelines. Sex and BMI also modified
   some associations, though to a lesser extent. We did not observe
   associations between ALT and PFOA (1.2\% change; 95\%CI: -2.5, 4.9),
   PFOS (2.2\% change; 95\%CI: -0.8, 5.3), or PFHxS (1.5\% change; 95\%CI:
   -0.4, 3.4). We also did not observe consistent associations for PFDA and
   PFUDA or with total bilirubin. In quantile g-computation models, each
   simultaneous one-quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was positively
   associated with AST (7.5\% higher; 95\%CI: 4.0, 10.4), GGT (9.7\%
   higher; 95\%CI: 1.7, 17.0), and ALP (2.8\% higher; 95\%CI: 0.5, 5.4).
   Conclusion Higher plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA -
   both individually and as a mixture - were associated with higher serum
   concentrations of liver function biomarkers. These results contribute to
   emerging evidence suggesting that higher levels of physical activity
   appear to be protective against the hepatotoxic effects of PFOA. This
   work contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the
   hepatotoxic effects of PFAS.},

Title = {Overall and individual associations between per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances and liver function indices and the metabolic mechanism},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},

Volume = {183},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can disrupt liver
   homeostasis. Studies have shown that a single exposure to PFAS may
   provoke abnormal liver function; however, few studies have investigated
   the overall effect of PFAS mixtures. We aimed to investigate
   associations between exposure to PFAS mixtures and liver function
   indices and explore the relevant mechanisms. This study included 278
   adult males from Guangzhou, China. Serum metabolite profiles were
   analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. We applied weighted quantile sum
   (WQS) regression as well as Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to
   analyze the association of nine PFAS mixtures with 14 liver function
   indices. PFAS mixtures were positively associated with apolipoprotein B
   (APOB) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and negatively associated
   with direct bilirubin (DBIL) and total bilirubin (TBIL) in both the WQS
   and BKMR analyses. In addition, Spearman's correlation test showed
   individual PFAS correlated with APOB, GGT, TBIL, and DBIL, while there's
   little correlation between individual PFAS and other liver function
   indices. In linear regression analysis, PFHxS, PFOS, PFHpS, PFNA, PFDA,
   and PFUdA were associated with APOB; PFOA, PFDA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFUdA
   were associated with GGT. Subsequently, a metabolome-wide association
   study and mediation analysis were combined to explore metabolites that
   mediate these associations. The mechanisms linking PFAS to APOB and GGT
   are mainly related with amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism.
   High-dimensional mediation analysis showed that glycerophospholipids are
   the main markers of the association between PFAS and APOB, and that
   (R)-dihydromaleimide, Ile Leu, (R)-(+)-2pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid,
   and L-glutamate are the main markers of the association between PFAS and
   GGT. In summary, overall associations between PFAS and specific indices
   of liver function were found using two statistical methods; the
   metabolic pathways and markers identified here may serve to prompt more
   detailed study in animal-based systems, as well as a similar detailed
   analysis in other populations.},

Title = {Associations between Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Exposures and
   Blood Lipid Levels among Adults-A Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {131},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Associations between per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFAS) and blood lipid levels in humans were mixed. OBJECTIVES: The
   objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize associations between
   PFAS and blood lipids in adults.METHODS: A literature search was
   conducted on PubMed and Web of Science for articles published through 13
   May 2022 that examined associations between PFAS and blood lipids,
   including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
   (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and
   triacylglycerols (TGs). Inclusion criteria included the presence of
   associations between five PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFDA, and PFNA) and
   four blood lipid measures (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TGs) in adults. Data on
   study characteristics and PFAS-lipid associations were extracted.
   Assessments of individual study quality were performed. Associations of
   changes of blood lipid levels corresponding to 1 interquartile range
   (IQR)-unit increase of blood PFAS levels were pooled using random
   effects models. Dose-response relationships were examined. RESULTS:
   Twenty-nine publications were included in the present analyses. Every
   IQR increase of PFOA was significantly associated with a 2.1-mg/dL
   increase in TC (95\% CI: 1.2, 3.0), a 1.3-mg/dL increase in TGs (95\%
   CI: 0.1, 2.4), and a 1.4-mg/dL increase in LDL-C (95\% CI: 0.6, 2.2).
   PFOS was also significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels, and the
   corresponding values were 2.6 (95\% CI: 1.5, 3.6) and 1.9 (95\% CI: 0.9,
   3.0), respectively. Associations of PFOS and PFOA with HDL-C levels were
   largely null. For minor PFAS species, PFHxS was significantly associated
   with higher levels of HDL-C {[}0.8 (95\% CI: 0.5, 1.2)]. Inverse
   associations were observed between PFDA and TGs {[}-5.0 (95\% CI: -8.1,
   -1.9)] and between PFNA and TGs {[}-1.7 (95\% CI: -3.5, -0.02)], whereas
   a positive association was observed between PFDA and HDL-C {[}1.4 (95\%
   CI: 0.1, 2.7)]. Nonsignificant nonlinear dose-response relationships
   were identified for associations of PFOA and PFOS with certain blood
   lipids.DISCUSSION: PFOA and PFOS were significantly associated with TC
   and LDL-C levels in adults. Whether these findings may translate into an
   ele-vated cardiovascular disease risk associated with PFAS exposure
   warrants further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11840},

Title = {Exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risk of
   stroke in adults: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 SEP 4},
Abstract = {Introduction: Evidence of the adverse metabolic health effects of
   perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is increasing.
   However, the impact of PFAS on cardiovascular diseases remains
   controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the impact of PFAS on
   the stroke risk.
   Content: Databases were searched for studies published up to November 1,
   2022, which report the association between stroke and exposure to at
   least one of four main PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid {[}PFOA],
   perfluorooctanesulfonic acid {[}PFOS], perfluorononanoic acid {[}PFNA],
   and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid {[}PFHxS]). Data extraction and
   quality assessment were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa
   scale.
   Summary and outlook: Four studies were included in this systematic
   review. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident stroke per
   1-log unit increment in each serum PFAS were combined in the
   meta-analysis. The risk of development of stroke was not significantly
   associated with PFOA, PFOS, or PFNA exposure (PFOA: pooled odds ratio
   {[}OR]=1.001, 95 \% confidence interval {[}CI]=0.975-1.028, p=0.752),
   whereas a moderately lower risk was associated with PFHxS exposure
   without statistical significance (pooled OR=0.953, 95 \% CI=0.908-1.001,
   p=0.054). PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA exposure showed a neutral association,
   while PFHxS showed a possible inverse association with the risk of
   stroke. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution.
   Further prospective observational studies with PFAS mixture analyses are
   warranted.},

   in the HBM4EU aligned studies},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widespread pollutants that
   may impact youth adiposity patterns. We investigated cross-sectional
   associations between PFAS and body mass index (BMI) in
   teenagers/adolescents across nine European countries within the Human
   Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative. We used data from 1957
   teenagers (12-18 yrs) that were part of the HBM4EU aligned studies,
   consisting of nine HBM studies (NEBII, Norway; Riksmaten Adolescents
   2016-17, Sweden; PCB cohort (follow-up), Slovakia; SLO CRP, Slovenia;
   CROME, Greece; BEA, Spain; ESTEBAN, France; FLEHS IV, Belgium; GerES
   V-sub, Germany). Twelve PFAS were measured in blood, whilst weight and
   height were measured by field nurse/physician or self-reported in
   ques-tionnaires. We assessed associations between PFAS and age-and
   sex-adjusted BMI z-scores using linear and logistic regression adjusted
   for potential confounders. Random-effects meta-analysis and mixed
   effects models were used to pool studies. We assessed mixture effects
   using molar sums of exposure biomarkers with toxicological/structural
   similarities and quantile g-computation. In all studies, the highest
   concentrations of PFAS were PFOS (medians ranging from 1.34 to 2.79 mu
   g/L). There was a tendency for negative associations with BMI z-scores
   for all PFAS (except for PFHxS and PFHpS), which was borderline
   significant for the molar sum of {[}PFOA and PFNA] and significant for
   single PFOA {[}beta-coefficient (95\% CI) per interquartile range fold
   change =-0.06 (-0.17, 0.00) and-0.08 (-0.15,-0.01), respectively].
   Mixture assessment indicated similar negative associations of the total
   mixture of {[}PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS] with BMI z-score, but not all
   compounds showed associations in the same direction: whilst {[}PFOA,
   PFNA and PFOS] were negatively associated, {[}PFHxS] associated
   positively with BMI z-score. Our results indicated a tendency for
   associations of relatively low PFAS concentrations with lower BMI in
   European teenagers. More prospective research is needed to investigate
   this potential relationship and its implications for health later in
   life.},

Volume = {56},
Pages = {62-69},
Abstract = {Sediments are habitats and major sources of nutrients for benthic
   organisms. High concentration of pollutants can impact negatively on the
   lives of such organisms and ultimately on the lives of human beings who
   may feed on them. This study was carried out in order to evaluate some
   environmental pollutants' load: heavy metals and pesticide residues in
   Irintan, Omi-Eye and Egbigbu river sediments in Ekiti State, Southwest
   Nigeria. Sediment samples were taken at upper, middle and lower courses
   of each river relative to the farm used for the study. The samples were
   air-dried in the laboratory, disaggregated, sieved and analysed for
   heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides (OCP) residues using standard
   methods. The heavy metal range at floodplains (mg/kg) was: Cr
   (0.252.08), Cu (0.19-14.28), Zn (BDL-2.53), Cd (BDL-0.87), Pb
   (BDL-0.32), Fe (0.38-22.35) while for OCP residues, the range (\&
   mu;g/kg) was \& alpha;-BHC (0.15-0.33), \& beta;-BHC (0.19-14.28), ẟ-BHC
   (0.25-1.09), lindane (BDL-1.23), chlorothalonil (0.87-1.44), heptachlor

   endosulfan II (BDL-0.67), aldrin (BDL-1.93), endrin (BDL-0.37), dieldrin
   (BDL-0.42), p,p-DDE (BDL-0.52), p,pDDT (BDL-1.20), methoxychlor
   (0.21-0.88). The pollutants' concentrations in the sediments were
   generally low at all the sites when compared with international
   guidelines for each pollutant. Governments in Nigeria should checkmate
   indiscriminate dumping of refuse most of which end in our rivers in
   order to reduce pollutants' concentration in rivers/sediments so as to
   protect the lives of benthic organisms.},

Abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) is a large group of
   fluorinated synthetic chemicals, e. perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and
   perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Many epidemiological studies have found
   that PFAS exposure is associated with hypertension risk, but others
   possess a different opinion. Overall, the relationship between PFASs and
   hypertension risk remains controversial. We sought to conduct a
   systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between
   PFAS exposure and human risk of hypertension.We conducted a
   meta-analysis based on population-involving studies published from 1975
   to 2023, which we collected from Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase
   databases. The odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD),
   with their 95\% confidence interval (CI), were used to assess the risk
   of hypertension with PFAS exposure. The statistical heterogeneity among
   studies was assessed with the Q-test and I2 statistics. Research
   publications related to our meta-analysis topic were systematically
   reviewed.Fourteen studies involving 71,663 participants, in which 26,281
   suffered hypertension, met the inclusion criteria. Our analyses suggest
   that exposure to general PFAS (OR = 1.09, 95\% CI = 1.04-1.14) or PFOS
   (OR = 1.17, 95\% CI = 1.05-1.30) is associated with hypertension risk.
   Specifically, elevated levels of general PFAS (SMD = 0.25, 95\% CI =
   0.08-0.42), PFHxS (SMD = 0.17, 95\% CI = 0.07-0.27), and PFDA (SMD =
   0.08, 95\% CI = 0.02-0.13) are associated with a high risk of
   hypertension.Our meta-analysis indicates that PFAS exposure is a risk
   factor for hypertension, and increased hypertension risk is associated
   with higher PFAS levels. Further study may eventually provide a better
   and more comprehensive elucidation of the potential mechanism of this
   association.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {317},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals has been linked to
   gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE). However, the
   results were conflicting and inconclusive. We conducted a systematic
   review and meta-analysis for an overview of these relationships. We
   searched PubMed, and Google Scholar for studies investigating bisphenol
   A, phthalates, and per or poly-fluoroalkyl substances and GH or PE.
   Pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95\% confidence interval (CI) were
   calculated for risk estimate using the generic inverse variance method.
   A total of 14 studies were included in the present analysis. The pooled
   results demonstrated that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, OR:1.20, 95\%
   CI: 1.04, 1.39), perfluoro octane sulfonic acid (PFOS, (OR:1.23, 95\%
   CI: 1.10, 1.38), and perfluononanoic acid (PFNA, OR:1.20, 95\% CI: 1.03,
   1.40) were significantly associated with an increased risk of PE. There
   was no significant association observed with perfluoro hexane sulfonic
   acid (PFHxS), perfluoro decanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoro heptanoic acid
   (PFHpA), and perfluoro undecanoic acid (PFUnDA) and PE. For GH, a
   statistically significant positive association was found with PFOA
   (OR:1.18, 95\% CI: 1.01, 1.39) and PFHxS (OR:1.15, 95\% CI: 1.02, 1.29).
   Among various phthalates analysed only mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP,
   OR:1.37, 95\% CI: 1.11, 1.70) showed an association with GH. From our
   analysis, bisphenol A exposure during pregnancy did not show a
   significant association with the risk of PE. Our findings indicated that
   exposure to PFASs such as PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA during pregnancy is
   associated with an increased risk of PE and PFOA and PFHxS with GH. We
   also found that MEP was associated with GH. Most of the results were
   unstable in sensitivity analysis. Since most of these associations have
   limited evidence, more research is needed to confirm these findings.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {232},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases
   (CVDs) and a leading cause of premature death. Epidemiological studies
   have found that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are associated with
   hypertension. However, the correlation between PFASs and hypertension
   has not been systematically reported. Based on evidence from population
   epidemiological surveys, we conducted a meta-analysis following the
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
   (PRISMA) guidelines to assess the correlation between PFASs exposure and
   hypertension. In this study, three databases of PubMed, Web of science,
   Embase were searched and 13 literatures with 81,096 participants were
   included. Literature heterogeneity was evaluated by I2 statistic, and
   the random effect model (I2 > 50\%) and fixed effect model (I2 < 50\%)
   were used to combine the studies in meta-analysis. The results showed
   that PFNA (OR = 1.11, 95\% CI: 1.04-1.19), PFOA (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI:
   1.02-1.23), PFOS (OR = 1.19, 95\% CI: 1.06-1.34) and PFHxS (OR = 1.03,
   95\% CI: 1.00-1.06) were significantly associated with hypertension,
   while other types of PFASs ( n-ary sumation PFAS, PFDA, PFUnDA) had no
   statistical significance. In addition, PFNA (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI:
   1.03-1.22), PFOA (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI: 1.01-1.25) and PFOS (OR = 1.12,
   95\% CI: 1.00-1.25) exposure were positively correlated with the risk of
   hypertension in men, but not in women. Our study reveals that PFASs are
   risk factors for hypertension, with notable gender differences observed
   in PFASs-exposed populations. Specifically, males exposed to PFNA, PFOA,
   and PFOS exhibit a higher risk of hypertension compared to females.
   However, further investigations are needed to delve into the precise
   mechanism through which PFASs contribute to the development of
   hypertension.},

Title = {Systematic review and meta-analysis of epidemiologic data on vaccine
   response in relation to exposure to five principal perfluoroalkyl
   substances},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {172},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Epidemiologic studies of serum per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) and antibody response to vaccines have suggested an
   adverse association, but the consistency and magnitude of this
   association remain unclear. Objective: The goal of this systematic
   review was to determine the size of the association between a doubling
   in perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) serum concentration and difference
   in log(e) antibody concentration following a vaccine, with a focus on
   five PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate
   (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid
   (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). Data source: We conducted
   online searches of PubMed and Web of Science through May 17, 2022 and
   identified 14 eligible reports published from 2012 to 2022. Study
   eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: We included
   studies conducted in humans, including mother-child pairs, which
   examined serum PFAS concentration in relation to serum concentration of
   antibody to a specific antigen following a vaccine. Study appraisal and
   synthesis methods: We used the risk of bias assessment for
   non-randomized studies of exposure and certainty assessment method
   proposed by Morgan et al. (2019). Using a multilevel meta-regression
   model, we quantitatively synthesized the data. Results: The 14 reports
   represented 13 unique groups of subjects; the frequency of studies of a
   given antibody was Tetanus (n = 7); followed by Diphtheria (6); Measles
   (4); Rubella (3); Haemophilus influenzae type b and Influenza A H1N1 (2
   each); and Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Influenza A H2N3, Influenza B, and
   Mumps (1 each). There were approximately 4,830 unique participants
   included in the analyses across the 14 reports. The models of
   coefficients between antibody concentration and the five principal PFAS
   showed homogeneity of associations across antibody types for each
   principal PFAS. In the models with all antibodies treated as one type,
   evidence of effect modification by life stage was present for PFOA and
   PFOS, and for consistency, all associations were evaluated for all ages
   and for children. The summary associations (coefficients for difference
   in log(e){[}antibody concentration] per doubling of serum PFAS) with
   95\% confidence intervals that excluded zero ({''}statistical
   support{''}), and certainty of evidence ratings were as follows: for
   PFOA and all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.10,
   -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.16, -0.03; moderate); for
   Diphtheria in children, -0.12 (-0.23, -0.00; high); for Rubella in all
   ages, -0.09 (-0.17, -0.01; moderate), and for Tetanus in children, -0.12
   (-0.24, -0.00; moderate). For PFOS the summary associations were, for
   all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.11, -0.01;
   moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.18, -0.03; moderate); for Rubella
   in all ages, -0.09 (-0.15, -0.03; high) and in children, -0.12 (-0.20,
   -0.04; high). For PFHxS the summary associations were, for all
   antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.03 (-0.06, -0.00;
   moderate) and in children, -0.05 (-0.09, -0.00; low); and for Rubella in
   children, -0.07 (-0.11, -0.02; high). Summary associations for PFNA and
   PFDA did not have statistical support, but all PFAS studied tended to
   have an inverse association with antibody concentrations. Limitations
   and conclusions: Epidemiologic data on immunosuppression and five
   principal PFAS suggest an association, with support across antibodies
   against multiple types of antigens.
   Data on Diphtheria, Rubella, and Tetanus were more supportive of an
   association than for other antibodies, and support was greater for
   associations with PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, than for PFNA or PFDA. The data
   on any specific antibody were scarce. Confounding factors that might
   account for the relation were not identified. Nearly all studies
   evaluated were judged to have a low or moderate risk of bias.},

Title = {Association between exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and
   levels of lipid profile based on human studies},
Journal = {REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 28},
Abstract = {Epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is associated with lipid profile
   levels, but with inconsistent conclusions from different studies. The
   aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship
   between PFAS exposure and lipid profile levels based on population-based
   epidemiological studies. Embase, PubMed, Ovid database, The Cochrane
   Library and Web of Science database were used to search appropriate
   studies (before September 6, 2022) on the correlation between PFAS
   exposure and lipid profile levels. beta value, odd ratio (OR) and 95 \%
   confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from studies. In this study,
   we found that higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were
   associated with exposure to perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) (beta
   value=0.13, 95 \% CIs: 0.02, 0.24) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid
   (PFOS) (beta value=0.13, 95 \% CIs: 0.04, 0.21). PFOA, PFOS and PFNA
   exposure were significantly related to the higher levels of total
   cholesterol (TC) with the pooled effect estimates of 0.08 (95 \% CI:
   0.02, 0.14), 0.13 (95 \% CI: 0.05, 0.21) and 0.14 (95 \% CI: 0.08, 0.20)
   respectively. In sum, our results identified that PFOA, PFOS, PFNA and
   PFUnDA were the most important risk factors for abnormal levels of lipid
   profile, indicating that we should prevent cerebrovascular disease by
   reducing and controlling PFAS exposure.},

Title = {Association between prenatal perfluorinated compounds exposure and risk
   of pregnancy complications: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {272},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Background and objective: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)
   have been shown to be persistent and bioaccumulative. An elevated danger
   of pregnancy complications perhaps connected with exposure to PFASs, but
   the potential effects remain elusive. The objective of this study is to
   investigate the possible association between PFASs exposure and
   pregnancy complications, drawing upon existing evidence. Methods:
   Electronic databases of PubMed, Qvid Medline, Embase, and Web of Science
   were searched thoroughly to identify eligible research published prior
   to November 28, 2023, examining the relationship between PFASs and
   pregnancy-related complications. To evaluate the quality of
   observational studies incorporated into the article, the Strengthening
   Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) tool was
   utilized. The main outcomes assessed in this study included gestational
   diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP),
   gestational hypertension (GH), and preeclampsia (PE). Results:
   Twenty-five relevant studies involving 30079 participants were finally
   selected from four databases. The combined estimates indicate that
   prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane
   sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and
   perfluoroenanthic acid (PFHpA) is associated with gestational diabetes
   mellitus (GDM) (PFOA: OR = 1.45, 95\%CI: 1.07-1.94, P = 0.015; PFHxS: OR
   = 1.16, 95\%CI: 1.00-1.36, P = 0.055; PFBS: OR = 1.44, 95\%CI:
   1.16-1.79, P = 0.001; PFHpA: OR = 1.41, 95\%CI: 1.10-1.82, P = 0.008).
   The exposure to PFBS is positively associated with HDP (OR = 1.27,
   95\%CI: 1.14-1.41, P < 0.001), while both PFOA and PFHpA demonstrate
   statistically significant positive correlations with GH (PFOA: OR =
   1.09, 95\%CI: 1.00-1.19, P = 0.049; PFHpA: OR = 1.43, 95\%CI: 1.15-1.78,
   P = 0.001). Negative correlations were observed for prenatal
   perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) exposure and GH (OR = 0.71, 95\%CI:
   0.57-0.87, P = 0.001). However, no compelling evidence was identified to
   link PFASs exposure with the risk of PE. Conclusion: According to the
   meta-analysis findings, exposure to PFASs may be linked to GDM, HDP, and
   GH, but it does not significantly raise the risk of PE alone. Further
   research with larger sample size is required to verify this potential
   association and explore the biological mechanisms.},

Title = {Assessing the health risk of hyperuricemia in participants with
   persistent organic pollutants exposure-a systematic review and
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {251},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles published in
   PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, we identified nine
   articles that provide evidence of the relationship between persistent
   organic pol-lutants and hyperuricemia. Our researchers assess the
   quality of the included studies and their risk of bias using the
   recommended method and tool. This study uses meta-analyses of the random
   effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios
   (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that the risk of
   hyperuricemia was strongly associated with three perfluorinated
   compounds, PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS, with the OR(95\%CI) of 1.26
   (1.07-1.47), 1.44(1.15-1.79), and 1.23(1.01-1.50) respectively. We also
   found a weak as-sociation between two other perfluorinated compounds,
   PFDA and PFHxS. Other than that, the summary ORs (95\% CIs) of incident
   hyperuricemia were 2.34 (1.79-3.08) for DDT, 3.25(2.40-4.39) for DDE,
   2.57 (1.37-4.81) for PCBs and 3.05(2.22-4.19) in trans-nonanchlor.
   Therefore, DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, PCBs, and
   trans-nonanchlor have also been linked with an increased risk of
   hyperuricemia in humans. This study finds that persistent organic
   pollutant is a critical factor for hyperuricemia, and further studies in
   specific regions will be considered in the future.},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is
   ubiquitous and has been associated with an increased risk of several
   cardio-metabolic diseases. However, the metabolic pathways linking PFAS
   exposure and human disease are unclear. OBJECTIVE: We examined
   associations of PFAS mixtures with alterations in metabolic pathways in
   independent cohorts of adolescents and young adults.METHODS: Three
   hundred twelve overweight/obese adolescents from the Study of Latino
   Adolescents at Risk (SOLAR) and 137 young adults from the Southern
   California Children's Health Study (CHS) were included in the analysis.
   Plasma PFAS and the metabolome were determined using
   liquid-chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. A
   metabolome-wide association study was performed on log-transformed
   metabolites using Bayesian regression with a g-prior specification and
   g-computation for modeling exposure mixtures to estimate the impact of
   exposure to a mix-ture of six ubiquitous PFAS (PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOA,
   PFNA, and PFDA). Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using
   Mummichog and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Significance across cohorts
   was determined using weighted Z-tests.RESULTS: In the SOLAR and CHS
   cohorts, PFAS exposure was associated with alterations in tyrosine
   metabolism (meta-analysis p = 0.00002) and de novo fatty acid
   biosynthesis (p = 0.03), among others. For example, when increasing all
   PFAS in the mixture from low ( 30th percentile) to high ( 70th
   percentile), thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone related to tyrosine
   metabolism, increased by 0.72 standard deviations (SDs; equivalent to a
   standardized mean difference) in the SOLAR cohort (95\% Bayesian
   credible interval (BCI): 0.00, 1.20) and 1.60 SD in the CHS cohort (95\%
   BCI: 0.39, 2.80). Similarly, when going from low to high PFAS exposure,
   arachidonic acid increased by 0.81 SD in the SOLAR cohort (95\% BCI:
   0.37, 1.30) and 0.67 SD in the CHS cohort (95\% BCI: 0.00, 1.50). In
   general, no individual PFAS appeared to drive the observed associations.
   DISCUSSION: Exposure to PFAS is associated with alterations in amino
   acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in adolescents and young adults.

Abstract = {Context Humans are now exposed to a multitude of chemicals throughout
   the life course, some of which may affect growth and development owing
   to their endocrine-like activity. Objective To assess the relationship
   of suspect toxicants to maturation, specifically to age at menarche.
   Methods We conducted two systematic reviews of age at menarche and PFOA,
   PFOS, PCBs and DDE/DDT based on publications indexed by pubmed. Results
   16 unique reports were identified. Most studies of PFOA and PFOS
   reported either no association or delays in the age at menarche; only
   one reported an earlier age. Studies of DDT and DDE were more mixed.
   Reports on PCBs varied by PCB congener group with an equal number of
   them reporting delays and no association but one an acceleration.
   Sources of variation in results include the timing of exposure
   assessment (prenatal vs. postnatal), level of the toxicant, and sample
   size. No obvious pattern to the variation in results could be tied to
   those sources of variation. Conclusion The absence of consistent
   evidence from multiple reports of earlier age at menarche suggests that
   these toxicants may not be responsible for accelerated sexual maturation
   in girls. However, human populations naturally vary in the variety and
   levels of exposure, making the comparison of studies difficult. Further,
   studies vary in methodology, complicating aggregation of results and
   generalisations.},

   Population-Based Cohort Studies},
Journal = {EXPOSURE AND HEALTH},

Month = {2024 FEB 6},
Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used and
   persistent chemicals, leading to ubiquitous exposure. Although high PFAS
   levels have been associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile,
   the distribution of levels and relations with cardio-metabolic risk
   markers in the general population have not been fully characterized. We
   assessed the association between blood levels of perfluorooctaneic acid
   (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and
   perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and a range of lipoproteins and
   metabolites as well as clinical lipid measurements. We used data from
   participants of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study (NEO) (n =
   584) and the Rhineland Study (n = 1962), jointly spanning an age range
   of 30 to 89 years. PFAS were measured with the Metabolon HD4 platform,
   and lipoprotein and metabolite profiles were measured using
   Nightingale's nuclear magnetic resonance-spectroscopy platform, and
   mainly comprised lipoprotein markers. Using linear regression analyses,
   we quantified age-, sex-, and education-adjusted associations of PFOA,
   PFOS, and PFHxS with clinical lipid measurements and 224 lipoproteins
   and metabolites. Higher levels of PFAS, particularly PFOS and PFHxS,
   were associated with higher concentrations of total lipid, cholesterol
   and phospholipid content in most HDL, IDL, LDL, and VLDL subclasses. The
   effect sizes were age-dependent for the majority of the associations,
   with the deleterious effects of PFAS being generally stronger in people
   below compared to those above median age. Our observation that in the
   general population even low PFAS concentrations are associated with an
   unfavorable lipid profile, calls for further critical regulation of PFAS
   substances.},

   systematic review of epidemiological studies},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {850},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used synthetic
   aliphatic compounds. This systematic review aims to assess PFAS
   associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL),
   high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and
   total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations.Method: We
   systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase,
   and Cochrane Library for rele-vant peer-reviewed English language
   articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles
   identified were also included in the search results. We categorised
   populations into adults (>= 18 years old) and children. Primary
   find-ings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL,
   HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood;
   secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and
   the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was
   done by vote counting of the effect directions between con-centrations
   of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample
   size >1000. Sign tests were per-formed to assess the statistical
   significance of the differences between positive and negative
   associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out
   articles with populations having high concentrations of
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS).
   Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality
   Assessment Tool.Results: A total of 58 articles were included for
   review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher
   concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC,
   PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associa-tions between PFAS and TG tended to be
   negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations
   between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally
   supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol
   concentrations.Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the
   concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human popula-tions. Future
   research should be conducted on the less well-studied PFAS to explore
   their effects on human health and in regions where such studies are
   currently lacking. (300 words)},

Title = {The effects of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances on female
   fertility: A systematic review and meta-analysis},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Objective: The reproductive toxicity of perfluoroalkyl and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been verified in both animal and
   in vitro experiments, however, the association between PFAS and female
   fertility remains contradictory in population studies. Therefore, in
   this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of
   PFAS on female fertility based on population evidence.Methods:
   Electronic searches of the Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library,
   and Embase databases were conducted (from inception to March 2022) to
   collect observational studies related to PFAS and female fertility. Two
   evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted information
   and evaluated the risk of bias for the included studies, meta-analysis
   was performed using R software.Results: A total of 5468 records were
   searched and 13 articles fully met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis
   showed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was negatively
   associated with the female fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.88, 95\%
   confidence interval (Cl) {[}0.78; 0.98]) and positively associated with
   the odds ratio for infertility (OR = 1.33, 95\%Cl {[}1.03; 1.73]).
   Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure was negatively associated with
   the fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.94, 95\% CI {[}0.90; 0.98]).
   Pooled effect values for per-fluorononanoic acid (PFNA),
   perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS)
   exposure did not find sufficient evidence for an association with female
   fertility.Conclusion: Based on the evidence provided by the current
   study, increased levels of PFAS exposure are asso-ciated with reduced
   fertility in women, this was characterized by a reduction in
   fecundability odds ratio and an increase in odds ratio for infertility.
   This finding could partially explain the decline in female fertility and
   provide insight into risk assessment when manufacturing products
   containing PFAS.},

Abstract = {As alternatives to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with shorter carbon
   chains or lower proportion of fluorine atoms, perfluorobutane sulfonate
   (PFBS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), and 6:2 fluorotelomer
   sulfonic acid (6:2FTSA) have been detected in various environmental
   media. However, it is unclear whether the toxicity of these alternatives
   is lower than that of PFOS. Therefore, this study investigated the
   toxicity and differences in PFBS, PFHxS, 6:2FTSA, and PFOS (0.2 mg/kg)
   after 56 d of exposure using the common invertebrate Eisenia fetida in
   soil as the test organism. The results showed that although PFOS, PFBS,
   PFHxS, and 6:2FTSA induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in earthworms
   and led to developmental and reproductive toxicity in terms of
   comprehensive toxicity, PFHxS > PFOS > PFBS >6:2FTSA. To reveal the
   mechanisms underlying the differences in toxicity between the
   alternatives and PFOS, we conducted molecular docking and transcriptomic
   analyses. The results indicated that, unlike PFOS, PFBS, and PFHxS,
   6:2FTSA did not cause significant changes in antioxidant offers a
   comprehensive understanding of product sustainability, aids
   decision-making, and enhances stakeholder engagement. The study also
   identifies knowledge gaps in the joint application of SD and LCA for
   environmental scenario analysis, suggesting the incorporation of
   optimization tools and strategy guidance for policy makers.},

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {311},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acids (HFPO-DA) and hexafluoropropylene
   oxide trimer acids (HFPO-TA) are alternatives to perfluorooctanoic acid
   (PFOA). However, little information on the comparison of their
   toxicities is available. Here, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PFOA,
   HFPO-DA, and HFPO-TA with exposure concentra-tions of 5 and 500 mu g/L.
   Behavioral abnormal, enzyme activities and gene expression profiles in
   zebrafish em-bryos were determined. Results showed that exposure to PFOA
   and its alternatives increased heart rates and inhibited locomotor
   activity of zebrafish embryos. Further, their exposures changed the
   enzyme activities (acetylcholinesterase and oxidative stress-related
   enzymes), ATP content, and expressions of genes related to
   hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid (HPT) axis, apoptosis, and lipid
   metabolism. Comparison analyses found that PFOA, HFPO-TA, and HFPO-DA
   exposures induced different effects on the embryonic development of
   zebrafish, which indicates the different modes of action. The HFPO-DA
   exposure induced specific effects on the disorder of lipid metabolism,
   HPT axis, and neurodevelopment. The HFPO-TA exposure also induced
   different effects from the PFOA exposure, which focused on lipid
   metabolism. The current data shows that the HFPO-DA and HFPO-TA might
   not be safe alternatives to PFOA. This study provides a new
   understanding of the biological hazards of PFOA alternatives in aquatic
   organisms, which can guide their usage.},

Abstract = {Most agricultural products are exposed to pesticides. Organochlorine
   (OCPs) insecticides have been banned for years due to their persistence
   in the environment and lipophilic properties. On the other hand, some
   carcinogenic organophosphates are used in high amounts. Therefore, this
   systematic review was performed with the keywords; pesticide,
   carcinogenic, carcinogen, residue, contamination, pollution, and food to
   determine the type of food and pesticide. 663 manuscripts were found by
   searching in databases. After initial screening and quality assessment

   selected manuscripts, about 13 pesticides were associated with
   carcinogenic effects. These pesticides were Chlorothalonil, Glyphosate,
   Tetrachlorvinphos, Parathion, Malathion, Diazinon, heptachlor,
   Hexachlorobenzene, aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, chlordane, Lindane. Most of
   these pesticides were organochlorine. The organochlorine pesticides are
   primarily detected in foods of animal origin. In some studies, the
   amount of carcinogenic organochlorine was higher than the permissible

Abstract = {Introduction: organochlorines are a group of organic pesticides
   developed to control insect plagues, but with a relevant impact for
   human health. Intoxication caused by organochlorines can cause serious
   health compromises that can lead to death. However, the organochlorines
   molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, researching about this
   topic is necessary to propose new therapeutic strategies. This study
   presents a bioinformatics approach to elucidate the metabolic pathways
   involved in organochlorines exposure using strategies based in support
   vector machines with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) followed by
   an enrichment pathway analysis with null-diffusion. Methods: five groups
   of HepG2 cells were exposed to aldrin, DDT, endosulfan, lindane, and a
   mixture of them. A control group with dimethyl sulfoxide was included. A
   metabolomic analysis was done using GC/MS-TOF, followed by SVM-RFE and a
   pathway analysis using FELLA in order to identify relevant metabolites
   and metabolic pathways affected. Genes reported by FELLA were introduced
   in gene ontology platform (GO) to estimate cellular components where
   reactions associated to organochlorines occur. Results: 153 metabolites
   were identified in metabolomic analysis. SVM-RFE was trained with the
   datasets and the top ten metabolites for each organochlorine were
   determined. Pentose phosphate and the central carbon metabolism in
   cancer were identified by FELLA as common pathways for all
   organochlorines. Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways
   were suggested for aldrin, DDT, and endosulfan. Taurine and hypotaurine
   metabolism for lindane, and citrate cycle for the organochlorine's
   mixture. GO analysis proposed to cytosol and exosomes as the cellular
   components where the pathways take place. Conclusions: the pathway
   analysis with FELLA suggests an impact in energy production and some
   amino acid synthesis pathways occasioned by the organochlorines
   exposure.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a typical perfluoroalkyl group compound,
   has received worldwide attention due to its significant environmental
   toxicity. Following regulatory bans on the production and emission of
   PFOA, concerns have been raised about the potential health risks and the
   safety of novel perfluoroalkyl analogues. HFPO-DA (trade name Gen-X) and
   HFPO-TA are two perfluoroalkyl analogues known to be bioaccumulative,
   whose level of toxicity and whether they are safe alternatives to PFOA
   remain unclear. In the following study, the physiological and metabolic
   effects of exposure to PFOA and its novel analogues were explored in
   zebrafish using 1/3 LC50 (PFOA 100 mu M, Gen-X 200 mu M, HFPO-TA 30 mu
   M). At the same LC50 toxicological effect, exposure to PFOA and HFPO-TA
   resulted in abnormal phenotypes such as spinal curvature, pericardial
   edema and aberrant body length, while Gen-X was little changed.
   Metabolically, PFOA, HFPO-TA and Gen-X all significantly increased total
   cholesterol in exposed zebrafish with PFOA and HFPO-TA also increasing
   total triglyceride levels. Transcriptome analysis showed that the number
   of differentially expressed genes in PFOA, Gen-X, and HFPO-TA treated
   conditions compared to control groups were 527, 572, and 3, 933,
   respectively. KEGG and GO analysis of differentially expressed genes
   revealed pathways and functions related to lipid metabolism as well as
   significant activation of the peroxisome proliferators-activated
   receptor (PPARs) pathway. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis identified
   significant dysregulation in the downstream target genes of PPAR alpha,
   which is responsible for lipid oxidative catabolism, and the SREBP
   pathway, which is responsible for lipid synthesis. In conclusion, both
   perfluoroalkyl analogues HFPO-TA and Gen-X exhibit significant
   physiological and metabolic toxicity to aquatic organisms and their
   environmental accumulation should be closely regulated.},

Abstract = {Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including gestational
   hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE), cause significant morbidity and
   mortality among pregnant women. Several environmental toxins,
   particularly those that affect the normal function of the placenta and
   the endothelium, are emerging as potential risk factors for HDP. Among
   them, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), widely used in a
   variety of commercial products, have been related to a variety of
   adverse health effects including HDP. This study was conducted by
   searching three databases for observational studies reporting
   associations between PFAS and HDP, all of which were published before
   December 2022. We used random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled
   risk estimates, and assessing each combination of exposure and outcome
   for quality and level of evidence. In total, 15 studies were included in
   the systematic review and meta-analysis. The results from meta-analyses
   showed that risk of PE was increased with exposure to PFOA
   (perfluorooctanoic acid) (RR = 1.39, 95\% CI = 1.05, 1.85; N = 6
   studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty), PFOS
   (perfluorooctane sulfonate) (RR = 1.51, 95\% CI = 1.23, 1.86; N = 6
   studies; exposure =1 ln-unit increment; moderate certainty), and PFHxS
   (perfluorohexane sulfonate) (RR = 1.39, 95\% CI = 1.10, 1.76; N = 6
   studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty). PFOS was also
   associated with an increased risk of HDP (RR = 1.39, 95\% CI = 1.10,
   1.76; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty). Exposure to legacy
   PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS) is associated with an increased risk of PE, and
   PFOS is further associated with HDP. In view of the limitations of
   meta-analysis and quality of evidence, these findings should be
   interpreted with caution. Further research is required that assesses
   exposure to multiple PFAS in diverse and well-powered cohorts.},

Abstract = {The objective of this study was to determine the associations between
   maternal exposure to PFASs and infant birth weight and to explore
   evidence for a possible dose-response relationship. Four databases
   including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Medline before 20
   September 2022 were systematically searched. A fixed-effect model was
   used to estimate the change in infant birth weight (g) associated with
   PFAS concentrations increasing by 10-fold. Dose-response meta-analyses
   were also conducted when possible. The study follows the guidelines of
   the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses
   (PRISMA). A total of 21 studies were included. Among these studies, 18
   studies examined the associations between PFOA and birth weight, 17
   studies reported PFOS, and 11 studies discussed PFHxS. Associations
   between PFHxS (ES = -5.67, 95\% CI: -33.92 to 22.59, P = 0.694) were
   weaker than those for PFOA and PFOS (ES = -58.62, 95\% CI: -85.23 to

   median PFOS concentration group (ES = -107.23, 95\% CI: -171.07 to

   dose-response relationship was found. This study showed negative
   associations between maternal exposure to PFASs and infant birth weight.
   Limited evidence of a dose-response relationship between exposure to
   PFOS and infant birth weight was found. Further studies are needed to
   find more evidence.},

Abstract = {Present study focused on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)
   occurrence in dry and wet seasons in the middle and lower Yangtze River
   (YZR) and changing temporal trends after years of control. Results
   revealed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 75 \% of total PFAS
   concentrations (Sigma(11)PFASs). Sigma(11)PFASs were ranged 0.20-28.49
   ng/L and 1.17-112.84 mu g/kg in water and sediment. The logK(oc) of
   perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids was positive with the carbon chain
   length (p < 0.05, r(2) = 0.78). A meta-analysis of results from 16
   peer-reviewed publications about PFASs in the YZR showed that
   fluorochemical industries strongly influenced the high PFAS levels in
   the detected scenes. PFOA was still the primary pollutant. Individual
   PFAS in the lower reach was higher than those in the middle reach. The
   mass loading of PFASs imported into the sea was 10.80 t/y. This study
   will help develop effective approaches for controlling emerging
   pollutants in the YZR.},

Title = {Profiling research on PFAS in wildlife: Systematic evidence map and
   bibliometric analysis},

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of
   synthetic chemicals that have been in use for over 70 years. Their
   ubiquitous distribution and harmful effects pose a threat to wildlife
   worldwide. To provide a comprehensive synopsis and show the gaps and
   gluts of existing research on PFAS exposure in wildlife, we created a
   systematic map and bibliographic analysis of the literature. We followed
   our protocol to conduct a systematic literature search on Scopus, Web of
   Science and five other databases. In two steps (title/abstract/keywords
   and full-text), we screened peer-reviewed empirical articles, preprints
   and theses in English that studied the concentration of at least one of
   34 PFAS compounds in free-ranging wildlife or their parts/products.
   Following the protocol, we extracted data and performed a critical
   appraisal. We included 581 publications. From the first and only paper
   in 2001, there was a linear annual increase to 54 papers in 2021. While
   PFOS (97\% of studies), PFOA (91\%) and long-chain PFAS in general were
   the most measured, few studies investigated new-generation PFAS (e.g.
   GenX and ADONA). Across the studied 1042 species from 26 taxonomic
   classes, the most frequent were the common carp (Cyprinus carpio, 8\%),
   polar bear (Ursus maritimus, 6\%) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis,
   5\%). Most sampling took place in the United States (17\%), Norway
   (13\%), Canada (12\%) and China (10\%), which were also the main
   publishing countries. Polar regions attracted significant research
   interest from countries all around the globe. Aquatic habitats (marine:
   31\%, freshwater: 28\%) of temperate zones were the most common
   locations for sample collection. We encourage researchers to work
   towards closing the following gaps: investigating new-generation PFAS,
   assessing PFAS in mid- and low-income countries and performing more
   long-term studies, especially on invertebrates. We note the recent rise
   in studies on the physiological consequences of PFAS exposure and
   encourage further work on this crucial topic. Furthermore, we recommend
   that the statement of potential and actual conflicts of interest, and
   the provision of raw data and analysis code should be made compulsory by
   all journals and routinely enforced. This practice will mitigate
   conflict of interest and ensure reproducibility.},

Title = {Estimation of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) half-lives in
   human studies: a systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {242},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) constitute a
   heterogeneous group of synthetic compounds widely used in industrial
   applications. The estimation of PFAS half-life (t1/2) is essential to
   quantify their persistence, their toxicity and mechanism of action in
   humans. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to summarize the
   evidence on PFAS half-lives in humans from the available literature, and
   to investigate the limitations and uncertainties characterizing
   half-life estimation. Methods: The search was conducted on PubMed,
   Scopus, and Embase databases up to July 03, 2023 and was aimed at
   identifying all papers that estimated PFAS half-life in human
   populations. We excluded studies on temporal trends or providing
   estimates of half-life based solely on renal clearance. As persistent
   and ongoing exposures can influence half-life estimation, we decided to
   include only studies that were conducted after the main source of
   exposure to PFAS had ceased. A random-effects meta-analysis was
   conducted on studies that reported perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA),
   perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) or perfluorohexanesulfonic acid
   (PFHxS) half-life estimation. Risk of bias was evaluated using the OHAT
   tool. Results: A total of 13 articles were included in the review, with
   5 studies conducted in exposed general populations and 8 studies
   conducted in exposed workers; the estimated mean half-life ranged from
   1.48 to 5.1 years for PFOA, from 3.4 to 5.7 years for total PFOS, and
   from 2.84 to 8.5 years for PFHxS. High heterogeneity among studies was
   observed; potential reasons include the variability among the
   investigated populations, discrepancies in considering ongoing
   exposures, variability in PFAS isomeric compositions, accounting for
   background exposure, time since exposure stopped and methods used for
   half-life estimation. Discussion: Despite the efforts made to better
   understand PFAS toxicokinetics, further studies are needed to identify
   important characteristics of these persistent chemicals. Biomonitoring
   studies should focus on persistent and unaccounted sources of exposure
   to PFAS and on individual characteristics potentially determining
   half-life, to ensure accurate estimates.},

   mice},

Abstract = {Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a diverse class of
   chemicals used in industrial processes, consumer products, and
   fire-fighting foams which have become environmental pollutants of
   concern due to their persistence, ubiquity, and associations with
   adverse human health outcomes, including in pregnant persons and their
   offspring. Multiple PFAS are associated with adverse liver outcomes in
   adult humans and toxicological models, but effects on the developing
   liver are not fully described. Here we performed transcriptomic analyses
   in the mouse to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatic toxicity
   in the dam and its fetus after exposure to two different PFAS,
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its replacement, hexafluoropropylene
   oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA, known as GenX). Pregnant CD-1 mice were
   exposed via oral gavage from embryonic day (E) 1.5-17.5 to PFOA (0, 1,
   or 5 mg/kg-d) or GenX (0, 2, or 10 mg/kg-d). Maternal and fetal liver
   RNA was isolated (N = 5 per dose/group) and the transcriptome analyzed
   by Affymetrix Array. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and
   differentially enriched pathways (DEP) were obtained. DEG patterns were
   similar in maternal liver for 5 mg/kg PFOA, 2 mg/kg GenX, and 10 mg/kg
   GenX (R2: 0.46-0.66). DEG patterns were similar across all 4 dose groups
   in fetal liver (R2: 0.59-0.81). There were more DEGs in fetal liver
   compared to maternal liver at the low doses for both PFOA (fetal = 69,
   maternal = 8) and GenX (fetal = 154, maternal = 93). Upregulated DEPs
   identified across all groups included Fatty Acid Metabolism, Peroxisome,
   Oxidative Phosphorylation, Adipogenesis, and Bile Acid Metabolism.
   Transcriptome-phenotype correlation analyses demonstrated > 1000
   maternal liver DEGs were significantly correlated with maternal relative
   liver weight (R2 >0.92). These findings show shared biological pathways
   of liver toxicity for PFOA and GenX in maternal and fetal livers in CD-1
   mice. The limited overlap in specific DEGs between the dam and fetus
   suggests the developing liver responds differently than the adult liver
   to these chemical stressors. This work helps define mechanisms of
   hepatic toxicity of two structurally unique PFAS and may help predict
   latent consequences of developmental exposure.},

Title = {Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and sex hormone
   levels in males based on human studies},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {271},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Background: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous
   chemicals in the environment and our daily lives. Several
   epidemiological studies have revealed that PFAS exposure is linked to
   male sex hormone levels; however, the conclusions are inconsistent
   across studies. Consequently, we performed a meta-analysis to
   systematically evaluate the association between PFAS exposure and male
   sex hormones. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standards were followed during the
   meta-analysis. PubMed, Wed of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and
   Ovid databases were used to identify suitable articles before June 2023.
   The 95\% CI and 0 values were calculated to assess the association
   between male sex hormone levels and PFAS exposure. Heterogeneity among
   the included studies was tested using inconsistency statistics (I2).
   Results: The literature search identified 12 published articles that met
   our search criteria, involving 7506 participants. Our results revealed
   that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA)
   exposures were negatively correlated with testosterone (0 = -0.05; 95\%
   CI: -0.09, -0.02, P = 0.003) and (0 = -0.04; 95\% CI: -0.08, 0.00, P =
   0.049), respectively. Conclusion: Exposure to PFNA and PFOA is
   negatively correlated with changes in male testosterone levels. This
   correlation suggests that we need to pay attention in the future to
   whether they are potential risk factors for male reproductive health.},

Abstract = {Some studies have suggested that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl
   substance (PFAS) exposure may be associated with semen quality in the
   general population, but with inconsistent results. To identify a more
   precise relationship between them, a meta-analysis was performed. We
   searched Embase, the PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Ovid databases, and
   Web of Science databases (before March 2022) for appropriate studies on
   the correlations of PFAS exposure with semen parameters. We extracted
   beta value and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) to conduct meta-analysis.
   Subgroup analyses was performed by sample size, geographic location, and
   sample type. A total of seven articles involving 2190 participants were
   included in this study. The concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid
   (PFOA) (beta value = - 1.38; 95\% CI: - 2.44, - 0.32) and
   perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (beta value = - 1.31, 95\% CI: - 2.35, -

   Subgroup analysis revealed that PFNA exposure was related to sperm
   morphology in studies with the sample size exceeding 200 people (beta
   value = - 0.14; 95\% CI: - 0.26, - 0.01). Our study supports that
   exposure to some PFASs (e.g., PFNA, PFOA) may be associated with semen
   quality, such as lower sperm progressive motility. Therefore, it is of
   great significance for the prevention of male infertility by control the
   use of PFASs.},

Abstract = {Alterations of the normal gut microbiota can cause various human health
   concerns. Environmental chemicals are one of the drivers of such
   disturbances. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of
   exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFAS)-specifically, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and
   2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy) propanoic acid (GenX)-on the
   microbiome of the small intestine and colon, as well as on liver
   metabolism. Male CD-1 mice were exposed to PFOS and GenX in different
   concentrations and compared to controls. GenX and PFOS were found to
   have different effects on the bacterial community in both the small
   intestine and colon based on 16S rRNA profiles. High GenX doses
   predominantly led to increases in the abundance of Clostridium sensu
   stricto, Alistipes, and Ruminococcus, while PFOS generally altered
   Lactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Staphylococcus, and
   Ligilactobacillus. These treatments were associated with alterations in
   several important microbial metabolic pathways in both the small
   intestine and colon. Untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis of the
   liver, small intestine, and colon yielded a set of compounds
   significantly altered by PFOS and GenX. In the liver, these metabolites
   were associated with the important host metabolic pathways implicated in
   the synthesis of lipids, steroidogenesis, and in the metabolism of amino
   acids, nitrogen, and bile acids. Collectively, our results suggest that
   PFOS and GenX exposure can cause major perturbations in the
   gastrointestinal tract, aggravating microbiome toxicity, hepatotoxicity,
   and metabolic disorders.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPer-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic
   pollutants and suspected endocrine disruptors.ObjectiveThe aim of this
   work was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to summarise
   the associations between prenatal or childhood exposure to PFASs and
   childhood overweight/obesity.MethodsThe search was performed on the
   bibliographic databases PubMed and Embase with text strings containing
   terms related to prenatal, breastfeeding, childhood, overweight,
   obesity, and PFASs. Only papers describing a biomonitoring study in
   pregnant women or in children up to 18 years that assessed body mass
   index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), or fat mass in children were
   included. When the estimates of the association between a PFAS and an
   outcome were reported from at least 3 studies, a meta-analysis was
   conducted; moreover, to correctly compare the studies, we developed a
   method to convert the different effect estimates and made them
   comparable each other. Meta-analyses were performed also stratifying by
   sex and age, and sensitivity analyses were also performed.ResultsIn
   total, 484 and 779 articles were retrieved from PubMed and Embase,
   respectively, resulting in a total of 826 articles after merging
   duplicates. The papers included in this systematic review were 49: 26
   evaluating prenatal exposure to PFASs, 17 childhood exposure, and 6
   both. Considering a qualitative evaluation, results were conflicting,
   with positive, negative, and null associations. 30 papers were included
   in meta-analyses (19 prenatal, 7 children, and 4 both). Positive
   associations were evidenced between prenatal PFNA and BMI, between PFOA
   and BMI in children who were more than 3 years, and between prenatal
   PFNA and WC. Negative associations were found between prenatal PFOS and
   BMI in children who were 3 or less years, and between PFHxS and risk of
   overweight. Relatively more consistent negative associations were
   evidenced between childhood exposure to three PFASs (PFOA, PFOS, and
   PFNA) and BMI, in particular PFOS in boys. However, heterogeneity among
   studies was high.ConclusionEven though heterogeneous across studies, the
   pooled evidence suggests possible associations, mostly positive, between
   prenatal exposure to some PFASs and childhood BMI/WC; and relatively
   stronger evidence for negative associations between childhood exposure
   to PFASs and childhood BMI.},

Abstract = {Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent, mobile, and
   toxic chemicals that are hazardous to human health and the environment.
   Several countries, including the United States, plan to set an
   enforceable maximum contamination level for certain PFAS compounds in
   drinking water sources. Among the available treatment options,
   photocatalytic treatment is promising for PFAS degradation and
   mineralization in the aqueous solution. In this review, recent advances
   in the abatement of PFAS from water using photo-oxidation and photo
   -reduction are systematically reviewed. Degradation mechanisms of PFAS
   by photo-oxidation involving the holes (h(vb)(+)) and oxidative radicals
   and photo-reduction using the electrons (e(cb)(-)) and hydrated
   electrons (e(aq)(-)) are inte-grated. The recent development of
   innovative heterogeneous photocatalysts and photolysis systems for
   enhanced degradation of PFAS is highlighted. Photodegradation mechanisms
   of alternative compounds, such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid
   (GenX) and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), are also
   critically evaluated. This paper concludes by identifying major
   knowledge gaps and some of the challenges that lie ahead in the
   scalability and adaptability issues of photocatalysis for natural water
   treatment. Development made in photocatalysts design and system
   optimization forges a path toward sustainable treatment of
   PFAS-contaminated water through photodegradation technologies.},

   hexachlorocyclohexane in a hybrid reactor system},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHEMICAL ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Lindane or gamma- hexachlorocyclohexane (\& gamma;-HCH) isomer has been
   one of the most extensively used pesticides worldwide. However, four
   additional Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers were produced during its
   manufacture, resulting in persistence in the environment due to their
   dissolvability and noxiousness. This study examines the sequential
   anaerobic-aerobic degradation of synthetically prepared solution of
   technical HCH (tHCH) utilizing a hybrid reactor system with a UASB
   reactor coupled to the aerobic system. The ideal conditions for t-HCH
   degradation were initial substrate concentration (100 mg L- 1), glucose
   as suitable electron donor, active biomass (12 g L-1), pH (neutral
   range), HRT (48 h) and organic loading rate (4.28 mg/g/day). Individual
   reactor findings demonstrated that the UASB reactor performed
   efficiently with these parameters, showing 90.03\% degradation of 100 mg
   L-1 t-HCH in two days after a month of operation. In aerobic
   degradation, the selected isolate can break down 87\% of 100 mg L-1 of
   t-HCH in eight days. Subsequent to individual reactor operations, the
   reactors were synchronized in the hybrid reactor and after 60 days of
   continuous operation, tHCH was dechlorinated completely in the presence
   of glucose as a co-substrate. Therefore, compared to individual
   anaerobic and aerobic treatments, this sequential degradation showed an
   improvement in HCH removal efficiency of > 99\%. This is the first study
   that demonstrates the mineralization of HCH intermediates in a hybrid
   reactor system. The metagenomic analysis of the anaerobic sludge and

Title = {Plasma levels of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and
   cardiovascular disease - Results from two independent population-based
   cohorts and a meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {181},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent
   chemicals that have been linked to increased cholesterol levels and thus
   may have a role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD).
   Objectives: To investigate associations between PFAS exposure and
   incident CVD (a combined CVD end-point consisting of myocardial
   infarction, ischemic stroke, or heart failure) in two independent
   population-based cohorts in Sweden. In addition, we performed a
   meta-analysis also including results from previous studies. Methods: In
   2,278 subjects aged 45-75 years from the EpiHealth study, the risk of
   incident CVD in relation to relative plasma levels of
   perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
   perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was investigated. Associations
   between plasma levels of six PFAS and incident CVD were also examined in
   the PIVUS-study (n = 1,016, all aged 70 years). In addition, a
   meta-analysis was performed including three previous prospective
   studies, together with the results from the present study. Results:
   There were no overall statistically significant associations between
   levels of the different PFAS and incident CVD, neither in EpiHealth nor
   in PIVUS. However, there was a significant sex interaction for PFOS in
   EpiHealth (p = 0.008), and an inverse association could be seen only in
   men (Men, HR: 0.68, 95 \% CI: 0.52, 0.89) (Women, HR: 1.13, 95 \% CI:
   0.82, 1.55). A meta-analysis of five independent studies regarding PFOA
   and incident CVD showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.80 (CI: 0.66, 0.94) when
   high levels were compared to low levels. Conclusions: This longitudinal
   study using data from two population-based cohort studies in Sweden did
   not indicate any increased risk of incident CVD for moderately elevated
   PFAS levels. A meta-analysis of five independent cohort studies rather
   indicated a modest inverse association between PFOA levels and incident
   CVD, further supporting that increasing PFAS levels are not linked to an
   increased risk of CVD.},

Abstract = {BackgroundPerfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are
   persistent organic pollutants in the environment. While some studies
   suggest that PFASs may contribute to cancer development, the link
   between PFAS exposure and cancer risk remains debated.MethodsThis
   dose-response meta-analysis explores the relationship between PFASs and
   cancer. It employs odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference
   (SMD), along with their 95\% confidence interval (CI), to assess the
   effects of PFASs on cancer risk. Relevant studies were sourced from Web
   of Science, PubMed, Embase, Medline, and CNKI databases. The
   dose-response relationship was assessed by the fixed-effects model and
   least-squares regression.ResultsForty studies, involving a total of
   748,188 participants, were included in this meta-analysis. Out of these,
   13 studies were specifically analyzed for the dose-response
   relationship. Findings revealed that exposure to PFASs, especially PFDA,
   significantly raises the risk of genitourinary cancers, and PFDA
   exposure shows a dose-dependent increase in overall and breast cancer
   risk. Additionally, PFOS exposure is associated with an increased cancer
   risk, and elevated PFOA levels were significantly observed in breast
   cancer patients.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that PFAS exposure is a
   potential cancer risk factor, with the carcinogenic potential of PFDA
   being dose-dependent.},

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widely used in
   industrial production, causing potential health risks to the residents
   living around chemical industrial plants; however, the lack of data on
   population exposure and adverse effects impedes our understanding and
   ability to prevent risks. In this study, we performed screening and
   association analysis on exogenous PFAS pollutants and endogenous
   small-molecule metabolites in the serum of elderly residents living near
   industrial plants. Exposure levels of 11 legacy and novel PFASs were
   determined. PFOA and PFOS were major contributors, and PFNA, PFHxS, and
   6:2 Cl-PFESA also showed high detection frequencies. Association
   analysis among PFASs and 287 metabolites identified via non-target
   screening was performed with adjustments of covariates and false
   discovery rate. Strongly associated metabolites were predominantly lipid
   and lipid-like molecules. Steroid hormone biosynthesis, primary bile
   acid biosynthesis, and fatty-acid-related pathways, including
   biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid metabolism,
   alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis, were
   enriched as the metabolic pathways associated with mixed exposure to
   multiple PFASs, providing metabolic explanation and evidence for the
   potential mediating role of adverse health effects as a result of PFAS
   exposure. Our study achieved a comprehensive screening of PFAS exposure
   and associated metabolic profiling, demonstrating the promising
   application for integrated analysis of exposome and metabolome.},

Abstract = {Prenatal exposure to single chemicals belonging to the per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) family is associated with biological
   perturbations in the mother, fetus, and placenta, plus adverse health
   outcomes. Despite our knowledge that humans are exposed to multiple
   PFAS, the potential joint effects of PFAS on the metabolome remain
   largely unknown. Here, we leveraged high-resolution metabolomics to
   identify metabolites and metabolic pathways perturbed by exposure to a
   PFAS mixture during pregnancy. Targeted assessment of perfluorooctanoic
   acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid
   (PFOS), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), along with untargeted
   metabolomics profiling, were conducted on nonfasting serum samples
   collected from pregnant African Americans at 6-17 weeks gestation. We
   estimated the overall mixture effect and partial effects using quantile
   g-computation and single-chemical effects using linear regression. All
   models were adjusted for maternal age, education, parity, early
   pregnancy body mass index, substance use, and gestational weeks at
   sample collection. Our analytic sample included 268 participants and was
   socioeconomically diverse, with the majority receiving public health
   insurance (78\%). We observed 13.3\% of the detected metabolic features
   were associated with the PFAS mixture (n = 1705, p < 0.05), which was
   more than any of the single PFAS chemicals. There was a consistent
   association with metabolic pathways indicative of systemic inflammation
   and oxidative stress (e.g., glutathione, histidine, leukotriene,
   linoleic acid, prostaglandins, and vitamins A, C, D, and E metabolism)
   across all metabolome-wide association studies. Twenty-six metabolites
   were validated against authenticated compounds and associated with the
   PFAS mixture (p < 0.05). Based on quantile g-computation weights, PFNA
   contributed the most to the overall mixture effect for
   gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), tyrosine, and uracil. In one of the
   first studies of its kind, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of
   using methods designed for exposure mixtures in conjunction with
   metabolomics to assess the potential joint effects of multiple PFAS
   chemicals on the human metabolome. We identified more pronounced
   metabolic perturbations associated with the PFAS mixture than for single
   PFAS chemicals. Taken together, our findings illustrate the potential
   for integrating environmental mixture analyses and high-throughput
   metabolomics to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying human
   health.},

Title = {Determinants of maternal and neonatal PFAS concentrations: a review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 10},
Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are used for their properties
   such as stain and water resistance. The substances have been associated
   with adverse health outcomes in both pregnant mothers and infants,
   including pre-eclampsia and low birthweight. A growing body of research
   suggests that PFAS are transferred from mother to fetus through the
   placenta, leading to in utero exposure. A systematic review was
   performed using the PubMed database to search for studies evaluating
   determinants of PFAS concentrations in blood matrices of pregnant
   mothers and neonates shortly after birth. Studies were included in this
   review if an observational study design was utilized, exposure to at
   least one PFAS analyte was measured, PFAS were measured in maternal or
   neonatal matrices, at least one determinant of PFAS concentrations was
   assessed, and results such as beta estimates were provided. We
   identified 35 studies for inclusion in the review and evaluated the PFAS
   and determinant relationships among the factors collected in these
   studies. Parity, breastfeeding history, maternal race and country of
   origin, and household income had the strongest and most consistent
   evidence to support their roles as determinants of certain PFAS
   concentrations in pregnant mothers. Reported study findings on smoking
   status, alcohol consumption, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI)
   suggest that these factors are not important determinants of PFAS
   concentrations in pregnant mothers or neonates. Further study into
   informative factors such as consumer product use, detailed dietary
   information, and consumed water sources as potential determinants of
   maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is needed. Research on
   determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is critical to
   estimate past PFAS exposure, build improved exposure models, and further
   our understanding on dose-response relationships, which can influence
   epidemiological studies and risk assessment evaluations. Given the
   potential for adverse outcomes in pregnant mothers and neonates exposed
   to PFAS, it is important to identify and understand determinants of
   maternal and neonatal PFAS concentrations to better implement public
   health interventions in these populations.},

Abstract = {Given that human biomonitoring surveys show per and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) to be ubiquitous, humans can be exposed to PFAS
   through various sources, including drinking water, food, and indoor
   environmental media. Data on the nature and level of PFAS in residential
   environments are required to identify important pathways for human
   exposure. This work investigated important pathways of exposure to PFAS
   by reviewing, curating, and mapping evidence for the measured occurrence
   of PFAS in exposure media. Real-world occurrence for 20 PFAS was
   targeted primarily in media commonly related to human exposure (outdoor
   and indoor air, indoor dust, drinking water, food, food packaging,
   articles, and products, and soil). A systematic-mapping process was
   implemented to conduct title abstract and full-text screening and to
   extract PECO-relevant primary data into comprehensive evidence
   databases. Parameters of interest included the following: sampling dates
   and locations, numbers of collection sites and participants, detection
   frequencies, and occurrence statistics. Detailed data were extracted on
   PFAS occurrence in indoor and environmental media from 229 references
   and on PFAS occurrence in human matrices where available from those
   references. Studies of PFAS occurrence became numerous after 2005.
   Studies were most abundant for PFOA (80\% of the references) and PFOS
   (77\%). Many studies analyzed additional PFAS, particularly, PFNA and
   PFHxS (60\% of references each). Food (38\%) and drinking water (23\%)
   were the commonly studied media. Most studies found detectable levels of
   PFAS, and detectable levels were reported in a majority of states in the
   United States. Half or more of the limited studies for indoor air and
   products detected PFAS in 50\% or more of the collected samples. The
   resulting databases can inform problem formulation for systematic
   reviews to address specific PFAS exposure queries and questions, support
   prioritization of PFAS sampling, and inform PFAS exposure measurement
   studies. The search strategy should be extended and implemented to
   support living evidence review in this rapidly advancing area.},

   Perfluorooctanoic Acid and Perfluorooctane Sulfonate in Aquatic Toxicity
   Studies Across Various Experimental Conditions},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are
   among the most frequently detected chemicals among the per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances in aquatic environments. Because of their
   high detection frequency, persistence, and potential toxicity, interest
   in both PFOA and PFOS has increased in recent years. However, a
   substantial number of PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests only report nominal,
   or unmeasured, treatment concentrations, which may complicate the
   determination of protective values. In addition, previous literature has
   indicated that differences between nominal and measured concentrations
   of both PFOA and PFOS could be linked to experimental conditions (e.g.,
   feeding regimes for test organisms, test vessel material {[}glass or
   plastic], use of solvent, and the presence of substrate). Therefore,
   this critical review examined whether nominal and measured
   concentrations were in close agreement with each other among the current
   PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature and if experimental conditions
   were associated with any observed differences. Nominal and measured
   concentrations in the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature
   generally displayed a high degree of linear correlation and relatively
   low median percent differences. Correlations between measured and
   nominal concentrations were >0.98 for PFOA and >0.95 for PFOS in
   freshwater tests across experimental conditions. For saltwater tests,
   correlations of >0.84 were observed for PFOA and PFOS (separate and
   combined) across experimental conditions. While measured PFOA and PFOS
   toxicity tests are generally preferred, the present meta-analysis
   demonstrated that experimental conditions had little influence on
   observed discrepancies between nominal and measured concentrations, with
   the exception of PFOS saltwater tests and PFOA and PFOS freshwater
   studies that contained substrate. Unmeasured tests with these conditions
   should be considered carefully based on project needs, with the caveat
   that the data sets for these two experimental conditions were limited.

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals that
   have been linked to increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus
   (GDM) and may affect glucose metabolisms during pregnancy. We examined
   the associations between maternal PFAS exposure and maternal glucose
   metabolisms and GDM risk among 1601 mothers who joined the
   Hyperglycaemia-and-Adverse-Pregnancy-Outcome (HAPO) Study in Hong Kong
   in 2001-2006. All mothers underwent a 75 g-oral-glucose-tolerance test
   at 24-32 weeks of gestation. We measured serum concentrations of six
   PFAS biomarkers using high-performance
   liquid-chromatography-coupled-withtandem-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS-MS).
   We fitted conventional and advanced models (quantile-g-computation
   {[}qgcomp] and Bayesian-kernel machine regression {[}BKMR]) to assess
   the associations of individual and a mixture of PFAS with glycaemic
   traits. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the enrollment period
   by the severe - acute -respiratory -syndrome (SARS) epidemic periods in
   Hong Kong between March 2003 and May 2004. PFOS and PFOA were the main
   components of PFAS mixture among 1601 pregnant women in the Hong Kong
   HAPO study, with significantly higher median PFOS concentrations (19.09
   ng/mL), compared to Chinese pregnant women (9.40 ng/mL) and US women
   (5.27 ng/mL). Maternal exposure to PFAS mixture was associated with
   higher HbA1c in the qgcomp (beta = 0.04, 95 \% CI: 0.01-0.06) model. We
   did not observe significant associations of PFAS mixture with fasting
   plasma glucose (PG), 1-h and 2-h PG in either model, except for 2-h PG
   in the qgcmop model (beta = 0.074, 95 \% CI: 0.01-0.15). PFOS was the
   primary contributor to the overall positive effects on HbA1c. Epidemic
   -specific analyses showed specific associations between PFAS exposure
   and the odds of GDM in the pre-SARS epidemic period. The median
   concentration of PFOS was highest during the peri-SARS epidemic (21.2
   {[}14.5-43.6] ng/mL) compared with the pre-SARS (12.3 {[}9.2-19.9]
   ng/mL) and post-SARS (20.3 {[}14.2-46.3] ng/mL) epidemic periods.
   Potential interactions and exposure -response relationships between PFOA
   and PFNA with elevated HbA1c were observed in the peri-SARS period in
   BKMR model. Maternal exposure to PFAS mixture was associated with
   altered glucose metabolism during pregnancy. SARS epidemic -specific
   asso- ciations call for further studies on its long-term adverse health
   effects, especially potential modified associations by lifestyle changes
   during the COVID-19 pandemic.},

Abstract = {2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) are endocrine disrupting chemicals that may cause
   breast cancer. However, there lacks consistent research on the
   association between TCDD, PFAS exposure, and breast cancer. To this end,
   a meta-analysis was carried out in this review to explore the
   relationship between these two endocrine disruptors and breast cancer.
   Relevant literature was searched from 5 databases: Medline, Scopus,
   Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. Odds ratios (OR) with 95\%
   confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled by fixed-effects and
   random-effects meta-analysis models. A total of 17 publications were
   finally included for quantitative evaluation. Meta-analysis showed that
   TCDD (OR = 1.00, 95\% CI = 0.89-1.12, I-2 = 39.3\%, P = 0.144), PFOA (OR
   = 1.07, 95\% CI = 0.84-1.38, I-2 = 85.9\%, P < 0.001), PFOS (OR = 1.01,
   95\% CI = 0.95-1.08, I-2 = 65.7\%, P < 0.001), PFNA (OR = 0.89, 95\% CI

   0.72-1.13, I-2 = 74\%, P < 0.001) were not significantly correlated with
   breast cancer. Internal exposure, however, showed a significant positive
   correlation between TCDD and BC (OR = 2.85, 95\% CI = 1.23-6.59, I-2 =
   0.0\%, P = 0.882). No statistically significant association between
   TCDD, PFAS exposure, and breast cancer was observed in this

Title = {The perfluoroalkyl substances influenced the distribution of bacterial
   communities and their functions from source water to tap water},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {247},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs)
   in drinking water are environmental issues that require special
   attention. The objective of this study was to know the effects of PFASs
   on microbial communities and their functional genes from source water to
   tap water. PFASs were detected by mass-labeled internal standards
   method, and the microbial communities and functional genes were analyzed
   by meta-genomics. Our results indicated that the concentration of total
   PFASs in the water ranged from 47.7 to 171.4 ng/ L, with
   perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) being
   the dominant types. The PFASs concentration decreased slowly from source
   to tap water in some months. PFBA, PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid
   (PFOS) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) influenced the functional
   genes related to two-component system, bacterial secretion system and
   flagellar assembly of Aquabacterium, Methylobacterium, and Curvibacter,
   which contributed significantly to macB and evgS. Therefore, the
   bacterial communities enhanced adaptation to fluctuating environments by
   upregulating some functional genes under the PFASs stress, with
   concomitant changes in the expression of ARGs. Moreover, PFASs also
   promoted the expression of functional genes associated with human
   diseases, such as shigellosis and tuberculosis, which increased the risk
   of human pathogenicity. The bench scale experiment results also
   suggested that PFOA and PFOS in drinking water can promote the ARGs
   proliferation and induce microbial risk. Therefore, it is necessary to
   take measures to prevent the risks caused by PFASs and ARGs in drinking
   water.},

Abstract = {Childhood diseases correspond to major public health issues. A large
   number of studies using different approaches provide evidence regarding
   effects of environmental exposures, encompassed in the exposome, on
   children's health. We aimed to summarize the overall level of evidence
   (LoE) from all streams of evidence regarding exposome effects on child
   health. For 88 selected chemical and urban factors, we retrieved the
   conclusions of agency reports or literature reviews published between
   2015 and 2021 regarding effects on child health, including
   cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodevelopmental, respiratory and other
   health outcomes. Adapted versions of PRISMA flowchart and AMSTAR-2 tool
   were used to select and assess the quality of the systematic reviews
   retrieved from PubMed and SCOPUS databases. For each factor-outcome
   pair, conclusions in three streams of evidence (epidemiological,
   toxicological and mechanistic, the latter corresponding to in vitro and
   in silico approaches) were translated into stream-specific LoEs and then
   combined into an overall LoE ranging from ``very unlikely{''} to ``very
   likely{''}. The 88 environmental factors were implied in 611
   factor-outcome pairs. Forty-four pairs (7\%), corresponding to 16
   factors, had a very likely overall LoE (>= 80\%); 127 pairs (21\%),
   corresponding to 49 factors, had a likely or more overall LoE (>= 60\%).
   For 81 pairs (13\%), no evidence was available in agency reports or
   published reviews, while for 275 pairs (45\%), corresponding to 68
   factors, the overall LoE was very unlikely (<20\%). Exposure factors
   with the greatest number of associated health outcomes with a high
   overall LoE were HCB, PCBs, temperature (8 outcomes), PFOA (7 outcomes),
   PFOS, cotinine (6 outcomes), arsenic, lead (5 outcomes), bisphenols A
   and S, PFNA and PM2.5 (4 outcomes), DDT, DDE and DDD, PFHxA, PFDA, green
   space, UV radiation (3 outcomes). We developed an approach to extract
   and summarize the existing evidence about effects of environmental
   factors on health. The plausibility database built for children's health
   can be used to identify research gaps, conduct quantitative risk
   assessment studies. It could be expanded to consider a larger fraction
   of the exposome and other age groups and should be updated on a regular
   basis.},

Title = {Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances and Breastfeeding as a Vulnerable
   Function: A Systematic Review of Epidemiological Studies},
Journal = {TOXICS},

Abstract = {Milk formation in the breast during breastfeeding is a complex
   hormonally regulated process, potentially sensitive to the effects of
   endocrine-disrupting chemical exposures. The environmental chemicals,
   per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are known endocrine
   disruptors. PFAS exposure have been associated with insufficient mammary
   gland development in mice and reduced breastfeeding duration in humans.
   The aim of this review was to gather the epidemiological evidence on the
   association between PFAS exposure and breastfeeding duration. Using
   PubMed and Embase, we performed a systematic literature search (on 23
   January 2023) to identify epidemiological studies examining the
   association between maternal PFAS exposure and breastfeeding duration.
   Animal studies, reviews, and non-English studies were excluded. The risk
   of bias was assessed using the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of
   exposures tool. Estimates describing the association between PFAS
   exposure and the duration of breastfeeding were identified, and the data
   were synthesized separately for each type of PFAS and for the duration
   of exclusive and total breastfeeding. Six studies with between 336 and
   2374 participants each were identified. PFAS exposure was assessed in
   serum samples (five studies) or based on residential address (one
   study). Five out of six studies found shorter total duration of
   breastfeeding with higher PFAS exposure. The most consistent
   associations were seen for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS),
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). The
   finding of a potential causal association between PFAS exposure and
   breastfeeding duration is in agreement with findings from experimental
   studies.},

Title = {Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risk of
   hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {AUG 2},
Abstract = {Background Existing evidence indicates that exposure to per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may increase the risk of
   hypertension, but the findings are inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to
   explore the relationship between PFASs and hypertension through this
   systematic review and meta-analysis.Methods We searched PubMed, Embase,
   and the Web of Science databases for articles published in English that
   examined the relationship between PFASs and hypertension before 13
   August 2022. The random effects model was used to aggregate the
   evaluation using Stata 15.0 for Windows. We also conducted subgroup
   analyses by region and hypertension definition. In addition, a
   sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the robustness of the
   findings.Results The meta-analysis comprised 15 studies in total with
   69,949 individuals. The risk of hypertension was substantially and
   positively correlated with exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS)
   (OR = 1.31, 95\% CI: 1.14, 1.51), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (OR =
   1.16, 95\% CI: 1.07, 1.26), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) (OR =
   1.04, 95\% CI: 1.00, 1.09). However, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA)
   exposure and hypertension were not significantly associated (OR = 1.08,
   95\% CI: 0.99, 1.17).Conclusion We evaluated the link between PFASs
   exposure and hypertension and discovered that higher levels of PFOS,
   PFOA, and PFHxS were correlated with an increased risk of hypertension.
   However, further high-quality population-based and pathophysiological
   investigations are required to shed light on the possible mechanism and
   demonstrate causation because of the considerable variability.},

Title = {Research progress on the application of skin permeability prediction
   model in health risk assessment of emerging pollutants},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},

Pages = {2354-2365},
Abstract = {Emerging pollutants are natural and synthetic chemicals that have
   recently been identified as dangerous to the environment and
   consequently to the health of human beings. A growing number of evidence
   shows that skin exposure is an important intake pathway for human to
   absorb emerging pollutants. The skin permeability of pollutants is
   mainly reflected by the skin permeability coefficient and permeation
   flux. In vivo or in vitro experiments with human and animal models are
   the main means to determine the transdermal characteristics of emerging
   pollutants. However, these methods have many disadvantages such as high
   cost, time-consuming, large differences, and ethics. It is difficult to
   accurately estimate the skin exposure risk of emerging pollutants.
   Therefore, it is necessary to build up a skin permeability prediction
   mathematical model to assess the exposure and health risks of emerging
   pollutants. This article systematically reviews the research progress on
   the application of the skin permeability prediction model in the health
   risk assessment of emerging pollutants. At first, the basic structure of
   the skin and the main transdermal absorption pathways of emerging
   pollutants are introduced. Secondly, the basic principles and
   applications of existing skin permeability prediction models are
   summarized. The QSAR model and PBTK model were described according to
   the ratio of penetration to exposure dose. The QSAR model is described
   in detail to establish a regular model to predict the permeability of
   chemical pollutants in the skin by linking the structure and
   physicochemical characteristics of chemical substances with skin
   permeability. The accuracy of the results depends on the reliability of
   the modeling data. The PBTK model can be divided into the
   single-compartment model and the two-compartment model according to the
   characteristics of skin structure. And we summarized the application of
   the PBTK model on exposure risk assessment for industry workers or
   consumers. Moreover, we clarified the application of permeability
   prediction models in exposure risk and human health risk assessment and
   prospected the future research direction on dermal exposure risk
   assessment of emerging pollutants. The skin permeability prediction
   model optimizes the exposure parameters of daily skin exposure in risk
   assessment by predicting the skin permeability coefficient or
   permeability of emerging pollutants, to accurately assess the human
   exposure and health risk of emerging pollutants. At the end of this
   research progress, the future research objectives of skin permeability
   prediction models are pointed out: Improving the accuracy of data and
   considering the effect of skin esterase on skin permeability in
   prediction models.},

Abstract = {Sustainable ecosystem is of essence to the river for its survival and
   maintenance of ecological balance. Gomti river, a groundwater-fed
   tributary of the Holy Ganges, is the lifeline of the middle
   Indo-Gangetic Plains. Screening of river pollutants for river cleanup is
   a challenging task. To this end, 20 km Lucknow stretch of Gomti was
   sampled at 5 locations for physicochemical-bacteriological analysis.
   Collected samples were analyzed for pH, TA, turbidity, DO, BOD, TH, COD,
   TDS, fecal coliform, and E. coli. Analytical instruments AAS and GC-ECD
   were used for heavy metal and organochlorine pesticide analysis. DO was
   3.2 +/- 0.3 to 7.4 +/- 0.4 (avg 5 +/- 1.8) mg/l, BOD was 10.6 +/- 0.5 to
   41 +/- 1.7 (avg 22.9 +/- 13.3) mg/l, while COD was 26.6 +/- 4.6 to 93.5
   +/- 4.6 (avg 56 +/- 31.3) mg/l. WQI values gradually increased from S1
   (56.7) to S5 (181.8) which denotes a significant deterioration of water
   quality downstream of the river. Cd, Mn, Fe, Pb, and Cr had increment of
   64, 18, 12, 6, and 2 fold, respectively, as compared to individual
   BIS:10500 standards. Among the OCPs, concentrations were in the order:
   aldrin > pp-DDT > beta-HCH > gamma-HCH > alpha-endosulfan > pp-DDE >
   alpha-HCH. Statistically strong positive correlation (r > 0.95 at 0.01)
   was observed among physicochemical parameters. Furthermore, bacterial
   species Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. Achromogenes, Aeromonas salmonicida
   strain A527, Aeromonas encheleia strain NCTC12917, and Aeromonas
   salmonicida strain ATCC33658 were identified by 16S rRNA gene
   amplification and molecular phylogenetic analysis. The study indicated
   heavy contamination of the river with organic and inorganic pollutants
   owing to mixing of untreated sewage, industrial effluents, and
   associated toxicants along with pathogenic bacteria which are a barrier
   to the harmony of aquatic life.},

Abstract = {Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is persistent
   endocrine disrupting chemicals. Previous evidence suggests that exposure
   to PFAS is associated with reproductive hormone levels, but the results
   of relevant studies are inconsistent. The objective of our study is to
   determine the association between exposure to PFAS and reproductive
   hormone levels in gender-specific general population. Method: Based on
   scientific search strategies, we systematically searched PubMed, Web of
   Science, Embase, Medline, and Scopus to obtain the eligible studies
   published before January 21, 2023. The quality of the included articles
   was assessed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation
   (OHAT) Risk of Bias tool. We combined the beta coefficient and 95\%
   confidence intervals (CI) using Stata.17 with random-effect model or
   fixedeffect model. We also performed subgroup analysis, sensitivity
   analysis, and Begger's and Egger's tests. Results: Eleven studies
   involving 7714 participants were included. Meta-analysis showed that
   PFHxS exposure was positively associated with estradiol (E2) levels in
   female {[}beta = 0.030, 95\% CI: (0.013, 0.046), P = 0.000]. A negative
   association was found between PFOA {[}beta = -0.012, 95\% CI: (-0.023,

   -0.000), P = 0.042] exposure with male testosterone (TT) levels. In the
   subgroup analysis, there were stronger associations in children than in
   adults. And the high heterogeneity was mainly due to the cross-sectional
   studies. Publication bias was not found in most of the analyses.
   Conclusion: Our study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly
   associated with reproductive hormone levels. Further related studies are
   needed to identify the association and potential mechanism in the

Abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) poses the leading threats to human health
   and life, and their occurrence and severity are associated with exposure
   to environmental pollutants. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS),
   a group of widely used industrial chemicals, are characterized by
   persistence, long-distance migration, bioaccumulation, and toxicity.
   Some PFAS, particularly perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS),
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS),
   have been banned, leaving only legacy exposure to the environment and
   human body, while a number of novel PFAS alternatives have emerged and
   raised concerns, such as polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic and carboxylic
   acid (PFESA and PFECA) and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene
   sulfonate (OBS). Overall, this review systematically elucidated the
   adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of legacy and emerging PFAS,
   emphasized the dose/concentration-dependent, time-dependent, carbon
   chain length-dependent, sex-specific, and coexposure effects, and
   discussed the underlying mechanisms and possible prevention and
   treatment. Extensive epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggests
   that accumulated serum levels of legacy PFAS possibly contribute to an
   increased risk of CVD and its subclinical course, such as cardiac
   toxicity, vascular disorder, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The
   underlying biological mechanisms may include oxidative stress, signaling
   pathway disturbance, lipid metabolism disturbance, and so on. Various
   emerging alternatives to PFAS also play increasingly prominent toxic
   roles in CV outcomes that are milder, similar to, or more severe than
   legacy PFAS. Future research is recommended to conduct more in-depth CV
   toxicity assessments of legacy and emerging PFAS and explore more
   effective surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies,
   accordingly.},

Abstract = {In vivo, in vitro, and epidemiological evidence suggests that
   perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may alter thyroid function in human
   health, with negative effects on maternal and fetal development
   outcomes. However, data on the effects of PFAS on thyroid hormones
   remain controversial. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 13 eligible
   studies searched from Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science by July 10,
   2022, to explore the relationship between maternal exposure to PFAS and
   thyroid health effects, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH),
   triiodothyronine (TT3), thyroxin (TT4), free T3 (FT3), and free T4
   (FT4). The estimated values (beta) and the corresponding confidence
   intervals (95\%CI) were extracted for analysis. The tests for
   heterogeneity, sensitivity and publication bias between studies were
   performed using Stata 15.0. The combined results showed a positive
   association between changes in TSH and exposure to perfluorooctane
   sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorodecanoic
   acid (PFDA), with no significant correlation observed between changes in
   other thyroid hormones and exposure to PFAS. This difference was
   attributed to sample size, region, sample type, body mass index (BMI),
   and gestational week. Our data recommend verifying the relationship
   between PFAS exposure and thyroid health effects in a large sample
   population cohort in future studies. In addition, health care should be
   taken into account in early and mid-pregnancy.},

Abstract = {Maternal endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exposure, the common
   environmental pollutants, was capable of involving in adverse pregnancy
   outcomes. However, the evidence of their connection is not consistent.
   Our goal was to comprehensively explore the risk of EDCs related to
   adverse pregnancy outcomes. One hundred and one studies were included
   from two databases before 2023 to explore the association between EDCs
   and adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, small for
   gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB).
   We found that maternal PFASs exposure was positively correlated with PTB
   (OR:1.13, 95\% CI:1.04-1.23), SGA (OR:1.10, 95\% CI:1.04-1.16) and
   miscarriage (OR:1.09, 95\% CI:1.00-1.19). The pooled estimates also
   showed maternal PAEs exposure was linked with PTB (OR:1.16, 95\%
   CI:1.11-1.21), SGA (OR:1.20, 95\% CI:1.07-1.35) and miscarriage
   (OR:1.55, 95\% CI:1.33-1.81). In addition, maternal exposure to some
   specific class of EDCs including PFOS, MBP, MEHP, DEHP, and BPA was
   associated with PTB. Maternal exposure to PFOS, PFOA, PFHpA was
   associated with SGA. Maternal exposure to BPA was associated with LBW.
   Maternal exposure to MMP, MEHP, MEHHP, MEOHP, BPA was associated with
   miscarriage. Maternal PFASs, PAEs and BPA exposure may increase adverse
   pregnancy outcomes risk according to our study. However, the limited
   number of studies on dose-response hampered further explanation for
   causal association.},

Title = {Systematic review and meta-analysis of birth weight and PFNA exposures},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {222},
Month = {APR 1},
Abstract = {We used a systematic review that included risk of bias and study
   sensitivity analysis to identify 34 studies examining changes in birth
   weight (BWT) in relation to PFNA biomarker measures (e.g., maternal
   serum/plasma or umbilical cord samples). We fit a random effects model
   of the overall pooled estimate and stratified estimates based on sample
   timing and overall study confidence. We conducted a meta-regression to
   further examine the impact of gestational age at biomarker sample
   timing. We detected a-32.9 g (95\%CI:-47.0,-18.7) mean BWT deficit per
   each ln PFNA increase from 27 included studies. We did not detect
   evidence of publication bias (pE = 0.30) or between-study heterogeneity
   in the summary estimate (pQ = 0.05; I2 = 36\%). The twelve high
   confi-dence studies yielded a smaller pooled effect estimate (beta
   =-28.0 g; 95\%CI:-49.0,-6.9) than the ten medium (beta =-39.0 g;
   95\%CI:-61.8,-16.3) or four low (beta =-36.9 g; 95\%CI:-82.9, 9.1)
   confidence studies. The stratum -specific results based on earlier
   pregnancy sampling periods in 11 studies showed smaller deficits (beta
   =-22.0 g; 95\%CI:-40.1,-4.0) compared to 10 mid-and late-pregnancy (beta
   =-44.2 g; 95\%CI:-64.8,-23.5) studies and six post-partum studies (beta
   =-42.9 g; 95\%CI:-88.0, 2.2). Using estimates of the specific
   gestational week of sampling, the meta-regression showed results
   consistent with the categorical sample analysis, in that as gesta-tional
   age at sampling time increases across these studies, the summary effect
   estimate of a mean BWT deficit got larger. Overall, we detected mean BWT
   deficits for PFNA that were larger and more consistent across studies
   than previous PFAS meta-analyses. Compared to studies with later
   sampling, BWT deficits were smaller but remained sizeable for even the
   earliest sampling periods. Contrary to earlier meta-analyses for PFOA
   and PFOS, BWT deficits that were detected across all strata did not
   appear to be fully explained by potential bias due to preg-nancy
   hemodynamics from sampling timing differences.},

Title = {Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) induces oxidative stress and causes
   developmental toxicities in zebrafish embryos},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {457},
Month = {SEP 5},
Abstract = {Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) is a short-chain perfluoroalkyl
   substance widely used to replace the banned perfluorooctanesulfonic acid
   (PFOS) in different industrial and household products. It has currently
   been identified in the environment and human bodies; nonetheless, the
   possible toxicities are not well-known. Zebrafish have been used as a
   toxicant screening model due to their fast and transparent developmental
   pro-cesses. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PFHxS for
   five days, and various experiments were performed to monitor the
   developmental and cellular processes. Liquid chromatography-mass
   spectrometry (LC/ MS) analysis confirmed that PFHxS was absorbed and
   accumulated in the zebrafish embryos. We reported that 2.5 mu M or
   higher PFHxS exposure induced phenotypic abnormalities, marked by
   developmental delay in the mid -hind brain boundary and yolk sac edema.
   Additionally, larvae exposed to PFHxS displayed facial malformation due
   to the reduction of neural crest cell expression. RNA sequencing
   analysis further identified 4643 differen-tiated expressed transcripts
   in 5 mu M PFHxS-exposed 5-days post fertilization (5-dpf) larvae.
   Bioinformatics analysis revealed that glucose metabolism, lipid
   metabolism, as well as oxidative stress were enriched in the
   PFHxS-exposed larvae. To validate these findings, a series of biological
   experiments were conducted. PFHxS exposure led to a nearly 4-fold
   increase in reactive oxygen species, possibly due to hyperglycemia and
   impaired glutathione balance. The Oil Red O' staining and qPCR analysis
   strengthens the notions that lipid metabolism was disrupted, leading to
   lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and malondialdehyde formation.
   All these al-terations ultimately affected cell cycle events, resulting
   in S and G2/M cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, our study},

Title = {Perfluorobutanesulfonate exposure induces metabolic disturbances in
   different regions of mouse gut},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {866},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS), an alternative to
   perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), has raised many health concerns.
   However, PFBS toxicity in the mammalian gut remains unclear. C57BL/6
   mice were exposed to 10 mu g/L and 500 mu g/L PFBS or 500 mu g/L PFOS in
   their water supply for 28 days. PFBS toxicity in the ileum and colon was
   explored and com-pared to that of PFOS. Biochemical analysis showed that
   tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-1f3 (IL-1f3) levels
   increased in the ileum exposed to 10 mu g/L PFBS, whereas no significant
   changes were observed in those levels in the colon. Catalase (CAT)
   activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), TNF-a, and IL-1f3 levels increased and
   glutathione (GSH) levels decreased in the ileum of the 500 mu g/L-PFBS
   group, whereas only MDA levels increased in the colon of the 500 mu
   g/L-PFBS group. The results showed that more severe damage occurred in
   the ileum than in the colon after PFBS exposure, and these align with
   the 500 mu g/L-PFOS group exposure as well. Furthermore, metabolomic
   anal-ysis revealed glutathione metabolism as a vital factor in inducing
   PFBS and PFOS toxicities in the ileum. Steroid hor-mone and amino acid
   metabolisms were other important factors involved in PFBS and PFOS
   toxicities, respectively. In the colon, GSH, pyrimidine, and glucose
   (especially galactose) metabolism was the main contributor to PFBS
   toxicity, and sulfur amino acid metabolism was the main pathway for PFOS
   toxicity. This study provides more evidence of the health hazards due to
   low-dose PFBS exposure in the mammalian gut.},

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of man-made
   chemicals that are persistent in the environment. They can be
   transferred across the placenta to fetuses and through human milk to
   infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that the benefits of
   breastfeeding infants almost always outweigh the potential risks of harm
   from environmental chemicals. However, there are few chemical-specific
   summaries of the potential harms of exposure to PFAS during the neonatal
   period through breastfeeding. This systematic review explores whether
   exposure to PFAS through breastfeeding is associated with adverse health
   outcomes among infants and children using evidence from human and animal
   studies. Systematic searches identified 4297 unique records from 7
   databases. The review included 37 total articles, including 9 animal
   studies and 1 human study measuring the direct contribution of exposure
   of the infant or pup through milk for any health outcome. Animal studies
   provided evidence of associations between exposure to PFOA through
   breastfeeding and reduced early life body weight gain, mammary gland
   development, and thyroid hormone levels. They also provided limited
   evidence of associations between PFOS exposure through breastfeeding
   with reduced early life body weight gain and cellular changes in the
   hippocampus. The direct relevance of any of these outcomes to human
   health is uncertain, and it is possible that many adverse health effects
   of exposure through breastfeeding have not yet been studied. This review
   documents the current state of science and highlights the need for
   future research to guide clinicians making recommendations on infant
   feeding.},

   with oxidative stress markers: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},

Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Background: Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polybrominated
   diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are intentionally produced persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs) that are resistant to environmental degradation.
   Previous in-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that POPs can induce
   oxidative stress, which is linked to neurodegenerative diseases,
   cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. However, findings in
   epidemiological studies are inconsistent and an evidence synthesis study
   is lacking to summarize the existing literature and explore research
   gaps.Objective: We evaluated the effects of PFAS, PCBs, OCPs, and PBDEs,
   on oxidative stress biomarkers in epide-miological studies.Methods: A
   literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL
   to identify all published studies related to POPs and oxidative stress
   up to December 7th, 2022. We included human observational studies
   reporting at least one exposure to POPs and an oxidative stress
   biomarker of interest. Random-effects meta-analyses on standardized
   regression coefficients and effect direction plots with one-tailed sign
   tests were used for quantitative synthesis.Results: We identified 33
   studies on OCPs, 35 on PCBs, 49 on PFAS, and 12 on PBDEs. Meta-analyses
   revealed significant positive associations of alpha-HCH with protein
   carbonyls (0.035 {[}0.017, 0.054]) and of 4{''}4-DDE with
   malondialdehyde (0.121 {[}0.056, 0.187]), as well as a significant
   negative association between 2{''}4-DDE and total antioxidant capacity
   (TAC) (-0.042 {[}-0.079,-0.004]), all beta {[}95\%CI]. Sign tests showed
   a significant positive association between PCBs and malondialdehyde
   (pone-tailed = 0.03). Additionally, we found significant negative
   associations of OCPs with acetylcholine esterase (pone-tailed = 0.02)
   and paraoxonase-1 (pone-tailed = 0.03). How-ever, there were
   inconsistent associations of OCPs with superoxide dismutase, glutathione
   peroxidase, and catalase.Conclusions: Higher levels of OCPs were
   associated with increased levels of oxidative stress through increased
   pro-oxidant biomarkers involving protein oxidation, DNA damage, and
   lipid peroxidation, as well as decreased TAC. These findings have the
   potential to reveal the underlying mechanisms of POPs toxicity.},

Title = {Mechanisms and pathways of PFAS degradation by advanced oxidation and
   reduction processes: A critical review},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {450},
Number = {4},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Numerous studies have demonstrated the degradation of perfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) by advanced oxidation or reduction processes. Howbeit,
   the current literature lacks a comprehensive and comparative overview of
   the various degradation pathways and mechanisms. This systematic review
   compiles and analyzes the mechanisms and degradation pathways of PFAS by
   persulfate activation, photocatalysis, UV/sulfite, electron beam,
   electrochemical oxidation, plasma, ozonation, and sonochemical
   oxidation. We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic
   acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were
   investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the
   defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type
   of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes
   usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by
   losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C-C
   and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate
   the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed
   crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic
   surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts)
   affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring
   PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate
   group). This study lays the groundwork for future research to analyze
   and elucidate the transformation products and pathways of PFAS in
   various treatment systems.},

Title = {Gestational GenX and PFOA exposures induce hepatotoxicity, metabolic
   pathway, and microbiome shifts in weanling mice},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {907},
Month = {JAN 10},
Abstract = {Ammonium perfluoro (2-methyl-3-oxahexanoate) (GenX), a replacement for
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has been detected in multiple
   environmental media and biological samples worldwide. Accumulated
   evidence implies that GenX exposure might exert adverse health effects,
   although the underlying mechanisms have not been fully revealed. In this
   study, pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to GenX (2 mg/kg/day), PFOA (1
   mg/kg/day), or Milli-Q water by gavage from the first day of gestation
   (GD0) until GD21. Necropsy and tissue collection were conducted in pups
   at 4 weeks of age. PFOA and GenX induced similar histopathological
   changes in both the liver and the intestinal mucosa, accompanied by
   higher serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase. Moreover,
   the capacity of hepatic glycogen storage and intestinal mucus secretion
   were significantly decreased, suggesting dysfunction of liver metabolism
   and the intestinal mucosal barrier. A total of 637 and 352
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the liver
   tissues of GenX and PFOA group, respectively. Most of the enriched
   pathways from the DEGs by KEGG enrichment analysis were
   metabolism-associated. Moreover, overexpression of CYP4A14, Sult2a1,
   Cpt1b, Acaa1b, Igfbp1, Irs-2 and decreased expression of Gys2
   wereobserved in livers of GenX exposed pups, supporting the hypothesis
   that there was metabolic disruption. Furthermore, DNA damage and cell
   cycle arrest proteins (Gadd45 beta, p21, Ppard) were significantly
   increased, while cell proliferation-related proteins (Cyclin E, Myc,
   EGFR) were decreased by gestational GenX exposure in the pups' liver. In
   addition, imbalance of gut microbiota and dysfunction of the intestinal
   mucosa barrier might contribute to hepatotoxicity at least in part.
   Taken together, our results suggested that gestational GenX exposure
   triggered metabolic disorder, which might be responsible for the
   hepatotoxicity in the pups in addition to dysfunction of the intestinal
   mucosa barrier. This study enriches the mechanisms of GenX-induced
   developmental hepatotoxicity by associating metabolic disorder with
   intestinal homeostasis.},

Title = {Global patterns and temporal trends of perfluoroalkyl substances in
   municipal wastewater: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {221},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Despite increasing regulatory efforts to reduce production of per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), continued human and ecological
   exposure to PFAS has led to concerns about historical releases.
   Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide important conduits
   between waste sources and the environment. We present a meta-analysis of
   results reported in 44 peer-reviewed publications that include 460
   influent and 528 effluent samples, collected from 21 countries, for
   which some or all of five per-fluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and
   three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were measured. Our meta
   analysis revealed global patterns and trends that, to our knowledge,
   have not been reported elsewhere. Regression analyses of samples
   collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global
   wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the PFAS and the
   corresponding mean concentration for each country. Although legacy
   compounds, perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid
   (PFOS), have been reported with the highest measured concentrations,
   their global temporal trends are lowest of all PFAS considered.
   Concentrations of most PFAS analyzed in wastewater in the United States
   have not changed significantly with time, whereas reported PFAS
   concentrations in wastewater effluent from China have increased from
   11\% to 37\% per year. In addition, our results show significant
   positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent
   concentrations of individual PFAS and the gross domestic product per
   capita of each country. Our analysis of this global data set also
   confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets: (i)
   none of the PFAS studied are effectively removed by conventional
   treatment processes; (ii) effluents from treatment plants that include a
   significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher
   PFAS concentrations; and (iii) the few studies that measured both
   aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended
   particulate matter (SPM) indicate that PFAS adsorbed to SPM can
   contribute significantly to the total PFAS load.},

Abstract = {Background \& Aims: Exposure to poly-and perfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFAS), a class of persistent organic pollutants, is ubiquitous. Animal
   studies suggest that PFAS may increase risk of fatty liver and
   hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via impacts on hepatic lipid, amino acid,
   and glucose metabolism, but human data is lacking. We examined
   associations between PFAS exposure, altered metabolic pathways, and risk
   of non-viral HCC. Methods: In this nested case-control study,
   pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS and metabolomics were measured in 50 incident
   HCC cases and 50 individually matched controls from the Multiethnic
   Cohort (MEC) study. Cases/controls were matched by age, sex, race, and
   study area. PFAS exposure and risk of HCC were examined using
   conditional logistic regression. A metabolome-wide association study and
   pathway enrichment analysis was performed for PFAS exposure and HCC
   risk, and key metabolites/metabolic pathways were identified using a
   meet in the middle approach. Results: High perfluorooctane sulfonic acid
   (PFOS) levels (90th percentile from NHANES; > 55 lg/L) were associated
   with 4.5 -fold increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 4.5, 95\% CI 1.2-16.0).
   Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PFOS exposure was associated
   with alterations in amino acid and glycan biosynthesis pathways, which
   were also associated with HCC risk. We identified 4 metabolites linking
   PFOS exposure with HCC, including glucose, butyric acid (a short-chain
   fatty acid), alpha-ketoisovaleric acid (a branched-chain a-keto acid),
   and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (a bile acid), each of which
   was positively associated with PFOS exposure and risk of HCC.
   Conclusion: This proof-of-concept analysis shows that exposure to high
   PFOS levels was associated with increased risk of non-viral HCC, likely
   via alterations in glucose, amino acid, and bile acid metabolism. Larger
   studies are needed to confirm these findings. Lay summary: Per-and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as ``forever
   chemicals `` because they are difficult to break down and stay in the
   human body for years, are extremely common and can cause liver damage.
   In a first of its kind study, we found that exposure to high levels of
   perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, one of the most common PFAS chemicals, was
   linked to increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans.
   Hepatocellular carcinoma is difficult to treat and is one of the most
   common forms of liver cancer, and these findings may provide new avenues
   for helping to prevent this disease.(c) 2022 The Author(s). Published by

Title = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and breast cancer: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ONCOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Month = {NOV 9},
Abstract = {Background: Globally, the burden of breast cancer has increased
   significantly in recent decades. Emerging evidence suggested that
   endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have the potential to
   interfere with the function of normal hormones, may play a crucial role
   in this trend. However, the potential relationships were inconsistent in
   various studies. Objective and search methods: In our study, we sought
   to fully evaluate the currently available epidemiological evidence to
   ascertain whether certain EDC congeners and their metabolites are
   related to breast cancer risk. Following the Preferred Reporting Items
   for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a
   comprehensive literature search of original peer-reviewed publications
   in three electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase.
   Publications that covered xenobiotic EDC exposures and breast
   cancer-confirmed histological results or antecedent medical records or
   reporting to health registers were taken into consideration. Outcomes:
   The final result of the literature search was 6,498 references, out
   which we found 67 publications that matched the requirements for
   meta-analysis and eight publications for qualitative trend synthesis. In
   this meta-analysis, statistically significant associations revealed that
   (i) 1-chloro-4-{[}2,2,2-trichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene
   (p,p'-DDT) and its major metabolite
   2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were somewhat
   related to a greater risk of breast cancer. However, this relationship
   only existed in blood serum but not in adipose tissue. (ii) Breast
   cancer risk was increased by exposure to chlordane and
   hexachlorocyclohexane. (iii) Five polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 99, PCB
   105, PCB 118, PCB 138, and PCB 183) can increase the risk of breast
   cancer. (iv) One phthalate congener (BBP) and one per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substance congener (PFDoDA) were negatively associated
   with breast cancer risk. Unfortunately, heterogeneity was not well
   explained in our review, and a limited number of available prospective
   studies investigating the associations between EDC exposure and breast
   cancer were included in our meta-analysis. To elucidate the overall
   associations, future large, longitudinal epidemiological investigations
   are needed.},

Title = {A metabolomic investigation of serum perfluorooctane sulfonate and
   perfluorooctanoate},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {180},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Background: Exposures to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and
   perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), environmentally persistent chemicals
   detectable in the blood of most Americans, have been associated with
   several health out-comes. To offer insight into their possible biologic
   effects, we evaluated the metabolomic correlates of circulating PFOS and
   PFOA among 3,647 participants in eight nested case-control serum
   metabolomic profiling studies from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and
   Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.Methods: Metabolomic profiling was
   conducted by Metabolon Inc., using ultra high-performance liquid
   chro-matography/tandem accurate mass spectrometry. We conducted
   study-specific multivariable linear regression analyses estimating the
   associations of metabolite levels with levels of PFOS or PFOA. For
   metabolites measured in at least 3 of 8 nested case-control studies,
   random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize study-specific
   results (1,038 metabolites in PFOS analyses and 1,100 in PFOA analyses).
   Results: The meta-analysis identified 51 and 38 metabolites associated
   with PFOS and PFOA, respectively, at a Bonferroni-corrected significance
   level (4.8x10-5 and 4.6x10-5, respectively). For both PFOS and PFOA, the
   most common types of associated metabolites were lipids (sphingolipids,
   fatty acid metabolites) and xenobiotics (xanthine metabolites,
   chemicals). Positive associations were commonly observed with lipid
   metabolites sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0) (P = 2.0x10-10 and 2.0x10-8,
   respectively), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpro-pionate (P =
   2.7x10-15, 1.1x10-17), and lignoceroylcarnitine (C24) (P = 2.6x10-8,
   6.2x10-6). The strongest pos-itive associations were observed for
   chemicals 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (P = 3.0x10-112 and
   6.8x10-13, respectively) and 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid
   (P = 1.6x10-14, 2.3x10-6). Other me-tabolites positively associated with
   PFOS included D-glucose (carbohydrate), carotene diol (vitamin A
   meta-bolism), and L-alpha-aminobutyric acid (glutathione metabolism),
   while uric acid (purine metabolite) was positively associated with PFOA.
   PFOS associations were consistent even after adjusting for PFOA as a
   covariate, while PFOA associations were greatly attenuated with PFOS
   adjustment.Conclusions: In this large metabolomic study, we observed
   robust positive associations with PFOS for several molecules. Further
   investigation of these metabolites may offer insight into PFOS-related
   biologic effects.},

Title = {Occurrence and environmental risk assessment of 22 pesticides in
   Brazilian freshwaters},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {260},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Pesticide contamination in water resources is a global threat. Although
   usually found at low concentrations, pesticides raise considerable
   toxicological concerns, mainly when mixtures are considered. The
   occurrence of 22 pesticides (2,4 D, alachlor, aldicarb, aldrin,
   atrazine, carbendazim, carbofuran, chlordane, chlorpyrifos, DDT, diuron,
   glyphosate, lindane, mancozeb, methamidophos, metolachlor, molinate,
   profenofos, simazine, tebuconazole, terbufos, and trifluralin) was
   investigated, through consolidated database information, in surface
   freshwaters of Brazil. Moreover, scenarios of environmental risk
   assessment considering isolated compounds and mixtures were performed,
   as well as a meta-analytic approach for toxicity purposes. Pesticides in
   freshwater have been reported from 719 cities (12.9\% of Brazilian
   cities), where 179 (3.2\%) showed pesticide occurrence above the limit
   of detection or quantification. Considering cities with more than five
   quantified, 16 cities were prone to environmental risks considering
   individual risks. However, the number increased to 117 cities when the
   pesticide mixture was considered. The mixture risk was driven by
   atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and DDT. The national maximum acceptable
   concentrations (MAC) for nearly all pesticides are higher than the
   predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for the species evaluated,
   except aldrin. Our results show the need to consider mixtures in the
   environmental risk assessment to avoid underestimation and review MAC to
   protect aquatic ecosystems. The results presented here may guide the
   revision of the national environmental legislation to ensure the
   protection of Brazilian aquatic ecosystems.},

Title = {The role of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) exposure in
   inflammation of intestinal tissues and intestinal carcinogenesis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are organofluorine substances
   that are used commercially in products like non-stick cookware, food
   packaging, personal care products, fire-fighting foam, etc. These
   chemicals have several different subtypes made of varying numbers of
   carbon and fluorine atoms. PFAS substances that have longer carbon
   chains, such as PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), can potentially
   pose a significant public health risk due to their ability to
   bioaccumulate and persist for long periods of time in the body and the
   environment. The National Academies Report suggests there is some
   evidence of PFOS exposure and gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation
   contributing to ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as
   ulcerative colitis are precursors to colorectal cancer. However,
   evidence about the association between PFOS and colorectal cancer is
   limited and has shown contradictory findings. This review provides an
   overview of population and preclinical studies on PFOS exposure and GI
   inflammation, metabolism, immune responses, and carcinogenesis. It also
   highlights some mitigation approaches to reduce the harmful effects of
   PFOS on GI tract and discusses the dietary strategies, such as an
   increase in soluble fiber intake, to reduce PFOS-induced alterations in
   cellular lipid metabolism. More importantly, this review demonstrates
   the urgent need to better understand the relationship between PFOS and
   GI pathology and carcinogenesis, which will enable development of better
   approaches for interventions in populations exposed to high levels of
   PFAS, and in particular to PFOS.},

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a group of thousands of
   manmade chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial
   processes. Toxicological studies have suggested that exposure to PFASs
   may lead to several adverse effects, including infertility and cancer
   development. In light of their widespread use, the contamination of food
   products has created health concerns in sites directly influenced by
   industrial and anthropogenic activity. In the present contribution, the
   current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in
   order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of
   contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake
   and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain
   the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species
   from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine
   species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic
   ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including
   aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to
   factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher
   and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination. Short-chain PFAS are
   suggested as chemicals of emerging concern to food security. However,
   the environmental and toxicological implications of short-chain
   congeners are not fully understood and, thus, much research is needed in
   this sense.},

Abstract = {The toxicity and environmental persistence of perfluorooctanoic acid
   (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are of great concern for
   food intake in humans. However, PFASs conversion or conjugation to other
   substances in rice grown on PFASs polluted soil has not been explored
   clearly. These unknown transformed or conjugated products of PFOA and
   PFOS could be harmful to human health. The restriction factor in
   evaluating the possible transformation of PFOA and PFOS is mainly
   attributed to the lack of an efficient method for screening PFOA and
   PFOS and their related metabolites. To circumvent this challenge, we
   established a nontargeted screening method by combining a fluoro-cotton
   fiber-based solid phase extraction (FC-SPE) and liquid
   chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to monitor
   the formation of possible organic fluorine compounds from rice (Oryza
   sativa L.) grown on PFASs. We synthesized fluoro-cotton fibers to serve
   as the FC-SPE packing material and characterized by field-emission
   scanning electron-microscope, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray
   photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The optimal extraction
   conditions for the prepared FC-SPE were investigated. The performance of
   FC-SPE in LC-MS analysis was validated by linearity, precision,
   recovery, and matrix effect. Then the FC-SPE combined with LC-HRMS was
   used to specifically capture organic fluorine compounds from complex
   matrices via F-F interaction, including rice seedlings grown in PFOA and
   PFOS polluted soil and soil samples. By the established FC-SPE LC-HRMS
   method, in total 429 features were found as the possible organic
   fluorine compounds from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil among
   the 1781 features from the rice seedlings. Finally, we employed a13C
   metabolic tracing analysis of organic fluorine compounds in combination
   with the FC-SPE LC-HRMS method to further identify the features that
   detected from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil. The final
   result indicated that there were not any new organic fluorine
   metabolites screened out from rice grown in PFOA or PFOS polluted soil.},

Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been widely used in different
   types of consumer and industrial applications such as surfactants,
   household cleaning products, textiles, carpets, cosmetics, firefighting
   foams, and food packaging because of their good stability and special
   physicochemical properties of hydrophobicity, oleophobicity, high
   temperature resistance, etc. Meanwhile, PFASs are considered an emerging
   organic pollutant due to their persistence and potential toxicity to
   human health. PFASs occur in edible oil, an important component of the
   global diet, mainly in three ways: raw material contamination, process
   contamination, and migration from oil contact materials. Thus, the
   occurrence of PFAS in edible oils has drawn more and more attention in
   recent years. In this work, the pertinent literature of the last two
   decades from the Web of Science database was researched. This review
   systematically addressed the potential sources, the contamination
   levels, and the progress of the determination of PFASs in edible oil. It
   aims to provide a relatively whole profile of PFASs in edible oil,
   render assistance to minimise human exposure to PFASs, and standardise
   the detection methods of perfluoroalkyl substances in edible oil.},

Title = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, polychlorinated biphenyls,
   organochlorine pesticides, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers and
   dysregulation of MicroRNA expression in humans and animals-A systematic
   review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {244},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Background: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemicals
   characterized by their environmental persistence. Evidence suggests that
   exposure to POPs, which is ubiquitous, is associated with microRNA
   (miRNA) dysregulation. miRNA are key regulators in many physiological
   processes. It is thus of public health concern to understand the
   relationships between POPs and miRNA as related to health outcomes.
   Objectives: This systematic review evaluated the relationship between
   widely recognized, intentionally manufactured, POPs, including per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides
   (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane {[}DDT],
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene {[}DDE], hexachlorobenzene {[}HCB]),
   with miRNA expression in both human and animal studies. Methods: We used
   PubMed and Embase to systematically search the literature up to
   September 29th, 2023. Search results for human and animal studies were
   included if they incorporated at least one POP of interest in relation
   to at least one miRNA. Data were synthesized to determine the direction
   and significance of associations between POPs and miRNA. We utilized
   ingenuity pathway analysis to review disease pathways for miRNA that
   were associated with POPs. Results: Our search identified 38 eligible
   studies: 9 in humans and 29 in model organisms. PFAS were associated
   with decreased expression of miR-19, miR-193b, and miR-92b, as well as
   increased expression of miR-128, miR199a-3p, and miR-26b across species.
   PCBs were associated with increased expression of miR-15a, miR-1537,
   miR-21, miR-22-3p, miR-223, miR-30b, and miR-34a, as well as decreased
   expression of miR-130a and let-7b in both humans and animals. Pathway
   analysis for POP-associated miRNA identified pathways related to
   carcinogenesis. Discussion: This is the first systematic review of the
   association of POPs with miRNA in humans and model organisms.
   Large-scale prospective human studies are warranted to examine the role
   of miRNA as mediators between POPs and health outcomes.},

Title = {The effects of exposure to environmentally relevant PFAS concentrations
   for aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels: Systematic
   review and meta-analyses},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {315},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is a collective name for
   approximately 4700 synthetic chemicals ubiquitous in the aquatic
   environment worldwide. They are used in a wide array of products and are
   found in living organisms around the world. Some PFAS have been
   associated with cancer, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption,
   and other health effects. Only a fraction of PFAS are currently
   monitored and regulated and the presence and effects on aquatic
   organisms of many PFAS are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to
   investigate the health effects of environmentally relevant
   concentrations of PFAS on aquatic organisms at different consumer
   trophic levels through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The main
   result shows that PFAS in concentrations up to 13.5 mu g/L have adverse
   effects on body size variables for secondary consumers. However, no
   significant effects on liver or gonad somatic indices and neither on
   fecundity were found. In addition, the results show that there are large
   research gaps for PFAS effects on different organisms in aquatic
   environments at environmentally relevant concentrations. Most studies
   have been performed on secondary consumers and there is a substantial
   lack of studies on other consumers in aquatic ecosystems.},

Volume = {94},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances may affect offspring
   immune development and thereby increase risk of childhood asthma, but
   the underlying mechanisms and asthma phenotype affected by such exposure
   is unknown.Methods In the Danish COPSAC2010 cohort of 738 unselected
   pregnant women and their children plasma PFOS and PFOA concentrations
   were semi-quantified by untargeted metabolomics analyses and calibrated
   using a targeted pipeline in mothers (gestation week 24 and 1 week
   postpartum) and children (age 1/2 , 11/2 and 6 years). We examined
   associations between pregnancy and childhood PFOS and PFOA exposure and
   childhood infections, asthma, allergic sensitization, atopic dermatitis,
   and lung function measures, and studied potential mechanisms by
   integrating data on systemic low-grade inflammation (hs-CRP), functional
   immune responses, and epigenetics.Findings Higher maternal PFOS and PFOA
   exposure during pregnancy showed association with a non-atopic asthma
   phenotype by age 6, a protection against sensitization, and no
   association with atopic asthma or lung function, or atopic dermatitis.
   The effect was primarily driven by prenatal exposure. There was no
   association with infection proneness, low-grade inflammation, altered
   immune responses or epigenetic changes.Interpretations Prenatal exposure
   to PFOS and PFOA, but not childhood exposure, specifically increased the
   risk of low prevalent non-atopic asthma, whereas there was no effect on
   atopic asthma, lung function, or atopic dermatitis. 2023;94:},

Title = {The effect of PFAS exposure on glucolipid metabolism in children and
   adolescents: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {15},
Month = {FEB 14},
Abstract = {Background: Previous studies showed that per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS), which are widely found in the environment, can
   disrupt endocrine homeostasis when they enter the human body. This
   meta-analysis aimed to evaluate current human epidemiological evidence
   on the relationship between PFAS exposure and glucolipid metabolism in
   childhood and adolescence. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science,
   Embase, and Cochrane Library databases, and identified population-based
   epidemiological studies related to PFAS and glucolipid metabolism
   indexes that were published before 30 December 2022. The heterogeneity
   of the included literature was assessed using the I-square (I-2) test
   and statistics Q. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to
   combine the effect size. Subgroup analysis based on age and sex of the
   study participants was performed. A sensitivity analysis was used to
   evaluate the robustness and reliability of the combined results. Egger's
   and Begg's tests were used to analyze publication bias. Results: A total
   of 12 studies were included in this analysis. There was a positive
   association between PFAS and TC (beta = 1.110, 95\% CI: 0.601, 1.610)
   and LDL (beta = 1.900, 95\% CI: 1.030, 2.770), and a negative
   association between PFAS and HOMA-IR in children and adolescents (beta =
   -0.130, 95\% CI: -0. 200, -0.059). PFOS was significant positive
   associated with TC (beta = 8.22, 95\% CI: 3.93, 12.51), LDL (beta =
   (12.04, 95\% CI: 5.08, 18.99), and HOMA-IR (beta = -0.165, 95\% CI:
   -0.292, -0.038). Subgroup analysis showed that exposure to PFAS in the
   adolescent group was positively associated with TC and LDL levels, and
   the relationship was stronger in females. Conclusion: PFAS exposure is
   associated with glucolipid metabolism in children and adolescents. Among
   them, PFOS may play an important role. Recognition of environmental PFAS
   exposure is critical for stabilizing the glycolipid metabolism
   relationship during the growth and development of children and
   adolescents.},

Title = {Association between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposure and

Abstract = {Background Emerging evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the
   etiology of diabetes. Objectives This study aimed to systematically
   review the epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS with
   mortality and morbidity of diabetes and to quantitatively evaluate the
   summary effect estimates of the existing literature. Methods We searched
   three electronic databases for epidemiological studies concerning PFAS
   and diabetes published before April 1, 2022. Summary odds ratio (OR),
   hazard ratio (HR), or beta and their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs)
   were respectively calculated to evaluate the association between PFAS
   and diabetes using random-effects model by the exposure type, and
   dose-response meta-analyses were also performed when possible. We also
   assessed the risk of bias of the studies included and the confidence in
   the body of evidence. Results An initial literature search identified
   1969 studies, of which 22 studies were eventually included. The
   meta-analyses indicated that the observed statistically significant
   PFAS-T2DM associations were consistent in cohort studies, while the
   associations were almost non-significant in case-control and
   cross-sectional studies. Dose-response meta-analysis showed a
   ``parabolic-shaped{''} association between perfluorooctanoate acid
   (PFOA) exposure and T2DM risk. Available evidence was rated with
   ``low{''} risk of bias, and the level of evidence for PFAS and incident
   T2DM was considered ``moderate{''}. Conclusions Our findings suggest
   that PFAS exposure may increase the risk of incident T2DM, and that PFOA
   may exert non-monotonic dose-response effect on T2DM risk. Considering
   the widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health
   effects of PFAS, further cohort studies with improvements in expanding
   the sample size, adjusting the covariates, and considering different
   types of PFAS exposure at various doses, are needed to elucidate the
   putative causal associations and potential mode of action of different
   PFAS on diabetes. Impact Statement A growing body of evidence suggests
   that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors
   and may contribute to the development of diabetes. However,
   epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS and diabetes is
   inconsistent. We performed this comprehensive systematic review and
   meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. The findings of
   this study suggest that exposure to PFAS may increase diabetes risk
   among the general population. Reduced exposure to these ``forever and
   everywhere chemicals{''} may be an important preventative approach to
   reducing the risk of diabetes across the population.},

Title = {Exposure to Organochlorine Pesticides and Female Breast Cancer Risk
   According to Molecular Receptors Expression: a Systematic Review and

Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewOrganochlorine pesticides (OCP) have been proposed as
   potential mammary carcinogens since they interact with steroid signaling
   pathways. However, the epidemiological results are not conclusive. Most
   studies have evaluated breast cancer (BC) as a single entity without
   considering the different molecular expressions, including estrogen
   receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2, that could differ
   in their association with these contaminants. Hence, we assessed the
   association between biological concentration of OCP and BC, according to
   its molecular receptor expression, based on a systematic review and
   meta-analysis.Recent FindingsOf the 141 articles eligible for full-text
   review, nine met the inclusion criteria. The way in which molecular
   expression was reported was heterogeneous; therefore, the inclusion of
   studies in the meta-analysis was limited to eight articles. A negative
   association was identified for beta-hexachlorocyclohexane and
   trans-nonachlor with ER + tumors and between hexachlorobenzene and ER -
   tumors. No associations were observed for p,p
   `-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, cis-nonachlor, and dieldrin, and it
   was not possible to evaluate the associations between OCP with HER2
   expression or triple-negative tumors due to lack of data.SummaryThe
   results suggest that some OCP might be associated with BC depending on
   the expression of ER. However, the evidence is not conclusive due to the
   scarce data. We identified several methodological aspects to fill the
   gaps in knowledge and increase the comparability among studies.},

Title = {Exposure to pesticides during pregnancy and the risk of neural tube
   defects: A systematic review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {913},
Month = {FEB 25},
Abstract = {Exposure to pesticides during pregnancy has been associated with several
   serious congenital malformations, such as neural tube defects,
   therefore, is a cause for concern in terms of human health. This review
   aims to gather information related to maternal exposure during pregnancy
   and the risk of triggering neural tube defects in the offspring. The
   search strategy for the studies followed the PRISMA guidelines. We
   conducted a systematic search in the Science Direct, PubMed, Cochrane
   Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for all
   epidemiological studies that sought to associate exposure to pesticides
   during embryonic development with the risk of neural tube defects
   (NTDs). The keywords used were ``pesticide{''}, ``herbicide{''},
   ``congenital{''} and ``neural{''}. Of the 229 articles, 8 eligible ones
   (7 case-control and 1 cross-sectional) evaluated pesticide exposure in
   pregnancy. Different methods were used, including analysis of biological
   samples and questionnaires. The pesticides studied included
   insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and nematicides. Insecticides were
   the most studied, with variations in concentrations between tissues and
   studies. Distinct levels of pesticides have been detected in maternal
   serum, placenta, and umbilical cord. Models were statistically adjusted
   for confounding factors, such as smoking and dietary supplement intakes.
   Concentrations were measured in different exposure windows
   (periconception and prenatal), related to NTDs such as anencephaly and
   spina bifida. Different data collection techniques, types of biological
   samples, and exposure windows were used, which made comparison
   difficult. The main pesticides studied included DDT, DDE, HCH, and
   endosulfan. Maternal serum showed the highest concentrations of
   pesticides, but detection in placental tissue and umbilical cord
   confirms embryonic exposure. Confounding variables were adjusted for in
   the analysis of the articles, but they may still contribute to the risk
   of NTDs. All the studies analyzed pesticide exposure and the
   relationship with NTDs. However, a more standardized survey would be
   ideal for better comparisons.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated whether the levels of heavy metal and
   pesticide residues in herbal decoctions in Korea in 2019 were within
   normal limits. In total, 30 decoctions composed of multi-ingredient
   traditional herbs were sampled from traditional Korean medicine (TKM)
   clinics, TKM hospitals, and external herbal dispensaries in 2019. The
   decoctions were analyzed for heavy metal content such as lead, arsenic,
   and cadmium using inductively coupled plasma optical emission
   spectrometry. For mercury, an automatic mercury analyzer based on the
   gold amalgamation process was used. For pesticide residues, gas
   chromatography with electron capture detection and gas chromatography
   with mass selective detection were used for the analyses. Based on the
   testing, heavy metals were identified in most of the decoctions (Cd:
   0.000-0.003 ppm, Pb: 0.003-0.023 ppm, As: 0.000-0.016 ppm, Hg:
   0.000-0.002 ppm). Pesticide residues (e.g., total DDT, total BHC,
   aldrin, endrin, dieldrin) were not detected at all. All of these were no
   more than the limit values in preceding studies. Therefore, this study
   confirms that the contents of heavy metals and pesticides in herbal
   decoctions are within safe levels based on a previous study and provides
   evidence for establishing safety management standards for herbal
   decoctions in Korea.},

Abstract = {Introduction: Per- and poly-luoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large,
   complex group of synthetic chemicals humans can be exposed to from
   occupational or environmental sources. In this systematic review and
   meta-analysis, tane Sulfonic Acid (PFOS), and risk of kidney, liver, and
   testicular cancer. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed to
   identify cohort and case-control studies reported after the Monograph of
   the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the Toxicological
   Profile of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. We
   assessed the quality of the studies by using a modified version of the
   Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Forest relative risk (RR) plots were
   constructed for liver, kidney, and testicular cancer. We conducted
   stratified analyses by geographic region, study design, quality score,
   outcome, years of publication, exposure source, and PFAS type. A
   random-effects model was used to address heterogeneity between studies.
   Results: Fifteen studies, including ten cohort studies, three
   case-control studies nested in a cohort, and two case-control studies
   were included after removing duplicate and irrelevant reports. We found
   an association between overall PFAS exposure and the risk of kidney
   cancers (RR=1.18, 95\% CI =1.05-1.32; I =52.8\%, 11 studies). Also, we
   showed an association between high-level exposure to PFAS and kidney
   cancer (RR=1.74, 95\% CI =1.23-2.47; p=0.005) and testicular cancer
   (RR=2.22, 95\% CI =1.12-4.39; p=0.057). There was no association with
   liver cancer. We found no heterogeneity by geographical region, PFAS
   type, study design, outcome, quality score, year of publication, or
   exposure source. Only two studies reported results among women.
   Conclusions: We detected an association between overall PFAS exposure
   and kidney cancer and high doses of PFAS with testicular cancer.
   However, bias and confounding cannot be excluded, precluding a
   conclusion in terms of causality.},

Journal = {FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {174},

Abstract = {Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a family of highly
   fluorinated aliphatic substances widely used in industrial and
   commercial applications. This study aims to determine the inhibition of
   PFASs towards sulfo-transferases (SULTs) activity, and trying to explain
   the toxicity mechanism of PFASs. In vitro recombinant SULTs-catalyzed
   sulfation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) was utilized as a probe reaction. The
   incubation system was consisted of PFASs, SULTs, PNP, 3
   `-phosphoadenosine-5 `-phosphosulfate, MgCl2 and Tris-HCl buffer.
   Ultra-performance liquid chromatography was employed for analysis of the
   metabolites. All tested PFASs showed inhibition to-wards SULTs. The
   longer the carbon chain length of the PFASs terminated with -COOH, the
   higher is its capability of inhibiting SULT1A3. PFASs with -SO3H had a
   relatively higher ability to inhibit SULT1A3 activity than those with
   -COOH, -I and -OH. The inhibition kinetic parameter was 2.16 and 1.42 mu
   M for PFOS-SULT1A1, PFTA-SULT1B1. In vitro in vivo extrapolation showed
   that the concentration of PFOS and PFTA in human matrices might be
   higher than the threshold for inducing inhibition of SULTs. Therefore,
   PFASs could interfere with the metabolic pathways catalyzed by SULTs in
   vivo. All these results will help to understand the toxicity of PFASs
   from the perspective of metabolism.},

Abstract = {Purpose of ReviewThere is a growing interest in understanding the health
   effects of exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)
   through the study of the human metabolome. In this systematic review, we
   aimed to identify consistent findings between PFAS and metabolomic
   signatures. We conducted a search matching specific keywords that was
   independently reviewed by two authors on two databases (EMBASE and
   PubMed) from their inception through July 19, 2022 following PRISMA
   guidelines.Recent FindingsWe identified a total of 28 eligible
   observational studies that evaluated the associations between 31
   different PFAS exposures and metabolomics in humans. The most common
   exposure evaluated was legacy long-chain PFAS. Population sample sizes
   ranged from 40 to 1,105 participants at different stages across the
   lifespan. A total of 19 studies used a non-targeted metabolomics
   approach, 7 used targeted approaches, and 2 included both. The majority
   of studies were cross-sectional (n = 25), including four with
   prospective analyses of PFAS measured prior to metabolomics.Most
   frequently reported associations across studies were observed between
   PFAS and amino acids, fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids,
   phosphosphingolipids, bile acids, ceramides, purines, and
   acylcarnitines. Corresponding metabolic pathways were also altered,
   including lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, nucleotide, energy
   metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and metabolism of
   cofactors and vitamins. We found consistent evidence across studies
   indicating PFAS-induced alterations in lipid and amino acid metabolites,
   which may be involved in energy and cell membrane disruption.},

Abstract = {Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) is an environmental pollutant
   that accumulates in adipose tissue through the food chain. Hypercaloric,
   high-fat diet is considered to promote the accumulation of toxic
   lipophilic substances in tissues, whereas the loss of body fat through
   caloric restriction results in a recirculation of these substances. In
   rats, oral administration of DDE causes the onset of tissues damage; the
   concomitant intake of a high-fat diet ameliorates tissues status,
   probably because of the entrapment of the lipophilic substance in fat
   depots. Recent evidence demonstrates that DDE alters the expression of
   metallothioneins, proteins involved in cellular defense from oxidative
   stress, in a diet- and tissue-specific manner. This study is aimed to
   verify if 2 weeks of caloric restriction after the oral DDE treatment
   can modify metallothionein gene expression in tissues of high-fat fed
   rats. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrates that metallothionein gene
   expression after calorie restriction is tissue-specific and strongly
   influenced by both previous dietary conditions and DDE exposure. To
   avoid misleading conclusions on the interference of toxic xenobiotics on
   metallothionein gene expression is particularly important to consider
   the tissue, the cellular conditions, and the nutritional status of the
   animals, especially when the protein is used as an index of cells
   health.},

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been manufactured for
   over seven decades. Owing to the unique characteristics of C-F bond, it
   has been widely used in the industrial and commercial products, which
   leading to its wide presence in the environmental and biological matrix.
   In this critical review, we systematically summarized the existing
   literature on the behaviors and mechanisms of bioaccumulation,
   transportation, and elimination of PFAS in humans and pointed out the
   deficiencies and gaps of the existing research. Additionally, we
   calculated the binding affinities between a total of 56 PFAS and four
   important renal PFAS transporters (organic anion transporter 1, 3, and
   4, together with urate transporter 4) to elucidate the renal elimination
   behaviors of PFAS in human body by molecular docking method for the
   first time. Furthermore, we put forwarded perspectives for future
   research to call on researchers to fill in the gaps of the existing
   studies and increase the investigations on the research topic. The
   understanding of the behaviors and mechanisms of PFAS in human beings
   are significant for the health risks assessment of human exposed to
   PFAS. Nevertheless, the research on the topic is still very limited.
   This review provides a comprehensive view of PFAS in human body,
   explores the potential human renal elimination mechanisms of PFAS, and
   presents insightful perspectives for further research on the
   relationship between PFAS exposure and its potential health effects on
   human beings.},

Title = {A review of PFAS adsorption from aqueous solutions: Current approaches,
   engineering applications, challenges, and opportunities},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {321},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have drawn great attention
   due to their wide distribution in water bodies and toxicity to human
   beings. Adsorption is considered as an efficient treatment technique for
   meeting the increasingly stringent environmental and health standards
   for PFAS. This paper systematically reviewed the current approaches of
   PFAS adsorption using different adsorbents from drinking water as well
   as synthetic and real wastewater. Adsorbents with large mesopores and
   high specific surface area adsorb PFAS faster, their adsorption
   capacities are higher, and the adsorption process are usually more
   effective under low pH conditions. PFAS adsorption mechanisms mainly
   include electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interaction, anion
   exchange, and ligand exchange. Various adsorbents show promising
   performances but challenges such as requirements of organic solvents in
   regeneration, low adsorption selectivity, and complicated adsorbent
   preparations should be addressed before large scale implementation.
   Moreover, the aid of decision-making tools including response surface
   methodology (RSM), techno-economic assessment (TEA), life cycle
   assessment (LCA), and multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) were
   discussed for engineering applications. The use of these tools is highly
   recommended prior to scale-up to determine if the specific adsorption
   process is economically feasible and sustainable. This critical review
   presented insights into the most fundamental aspects of PFAS adsorption
   that would be helpful to the development of effective adsorbents for the
   removal of PFAS in future studies and provide opportunities for
   large-scale engineering applications.},

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose serious human health and
   environmental risks due to their persistence and toxicity. Among the
   available PFAS remediation options, the electrochemical approach is
   promising with better control. In this review, recent advances in the
   decontamination of PFAS from water using several state-of-the-art
   electrochemical strategies, including electro-oxidation,
   electro-adsorption, and electro-coagulation, were systematically
   reviewed. We aimed to elucidate their design principles, underlying
   working mechanisms, and the effects of operation factors (e.g., solution
   pH, applied voltage, and reactor configuration). The recent developments
   of innovative electrochemical systems and novel electrode materials were
   highlighted. In addition, the development of coupled processes that
   could overcome the shortcomings of low efficiency and high energy
   consumption of conventional electrochemical systems was also emphasized.
   This review identified several major knowledge gaps and challenges in
   the scalability and adaptability of efficient electrochemical systems
   for PFAS remediation. Materials science and system design developments

Journal = {TOXICS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exhibit high persistence in
   the environment and accumulate within the human body, warranting a
   thorough assessment of their toxicity. In this study, we exposed mice
   (male C57BL/6J mice aged 8 weeks) to a composite of nine PFAS,
   encompassing both long-chain PFAS (e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid and
   perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) and short-chain PFAS (e.g.,
   perfluorobutanoic acid and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid). The exposure
   concentrations of PFAS were equivalent to the estimated daily human
   intake in the composition reported (1 mu g/L (sum of the nine
   compounds), representing the maximum reported exposure concentration).
   Histological examination revealed hepatocyte vacuolization and irregular
   hepatocyte cord arrangement, indicating that exposure to low levels of
   the PFAS mixture causes morphological changes in liver tissues.
   Transcriptome analysis revealed that PFAS exposure mainly altered a
   group of genes related to metabolism and chemical carcinogenesis.
   Machine learning analysis of the liver metabolome showed a typical
   concentration-independent alteration upon PFAS exposure, with the
   annotation of substances such as glutathione and 5-aminovaleric acid.
   This study demonstrates that daily exposure to PFAS leads to
   morphological changes in liver tissues and alters the expression of
   metabolism- and cancer-related genes as well as phospholipid metabolism.},

Title = {Novel insights into perfluorinated compound-induced hepatotoxicity:
   Chronic dietary restriction exacerbates the effects of PFBS on hepatic
   lipid metabolism in mice},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {181},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Perfluorobutane sulfonates (PFBS) have garnered extensive utilization
   because of their distinctive physico-chemical properties. The liver acts
   as a key target organ for toxicity within the body and is vital for
   regulating metabolic processes, particularly lipid metabolism. However,
   there is currently a significant research gap regarding the influences
   of PFBS on hepatic lipid metabolism, especially in individuals with
   different dietary statuses. Here, the objective of this research was to
   examine the effects of PFBS on hepatic function under different dietary
   conditions. The results suggested that the levels of liver injury
   biomarkers were significantly upregulated, e.g., transaminase (GPT,
   GOT), while liver lipid levels were downregulated after exposure to PFBS
   at concentration of 50 mu g/L for 42 days. Moreover, restricted diet
   further intensified the adverse effects of PFBS on the liver.
   Metabolomics analysis identified significant alterations in
   lipid-related metabolites in PFBS-induced hepatotoxicity, PFBS exposure
   induced a decrease in lysophosphatidylethanolamine and
   lysophosphatidylcho-line. PFBS exposure caused an increase in
   aldosterone and prostaglandin f2alpha under restricted diet. In PFBS
   treatment group, histidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, and
   arginine biosynthesis were the main pathway for PFBS toxicity.
   Aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption as a vital factor in inducing
   PFBS toxicity in the RD-PFBS treatment group. The analysis of 16S rRNA
   sequencing revealed that exposure to PFBS resulted in imbalance of gut
   microbial communities. PFBS exposure induced a decrease in Akkermansia
   and Lactobacillus, but an increase in Enterococcus. PFBS exposure caused
   the abundance of Lachnospiraceae\_NK4A136\_group was significantly
   elevated under restricted diet. Additionally, disruptions in the
   expression of genes involved in lipid production and consumption may
   significantly contribute to lipid imbalance in the liver. This study
   underscores the importance of recognizing the harmful impact of PFBS on
   liver function, along with the biotoxicity of contaminant influenced by
   dietary habits.},

Abstract = {Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are fluoro-organic compounds
   comprising thousands of anthropogenically produced chemicals with
   various industrial and consumer applications. This review compiles
   recent information on the sources, occurrence, and health effects of
   PFAS in aquatic environments. Secondly, as a primary requirement for
   assessing the PFAS concentration in water, this review systematically
   summarised the analytical methodologies (sample preparation and
   analytical detection techniques) for PFAS. Furthermore, health risks
   associated with PFAS in water are outlined. Finally, researchers
   worldwide have investigated the strategies for the remediation and
   elimination of PFAS from water. Previous studies have shown that PFASs
   are present in various water bodies with the highest concentration
   detected in Germany (94-4,385 ng center dot L-1 in river and drinking
   waters). The findings of this review further revealed that solid-phase
   extraction techniques were the most preferred for sample preparation
   compared to liquid-liquid extraction techniques. Solid-phase extraction
   technique improved the limit of detection and the limit of
   quantification of many analytical techniques to 0.010-1.15 and
   0.030-4.00 ng center dot L-1, respectively. For PFAS remediation, the
   adsorption method and chemical oxidation using heat-activated persulfate
   and photochemical oxidation were the most used techniques. The most
   studied water matrices were drinking, river, groundwater, wastewater,
   and modelled ultra-pure water. The most used detection technique was
   found to be liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS).},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {916},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a toxic pollutant that bioaccumulates
   and is a significant public health concern due to its ubiquitous and
   persistent occurrence in global environments. Few studies have evaluated
   the adverse effects of PFOA on immune system, and this is particularly
   true for mollusks. Here, the PFOA-associated effects on immune system
   were evaluated in Ruditapes philippinarum using integrated analysis of
   metabolomes, microbiomes, and transcriptomes, providing evidence for
   possible mechanisms related to immunotoxicity. PFOA exposure caused
   clear variation in several important metabolites related to immune
   regulatory function within the haemolyph from R. philippinarum, while
   also altering key metabolic pathways, including those of lipids,
   unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), and bile acids (BAs). After exposure to
   PFOAs, intestinal bacterial communities also clearly changed, with the
   predominant microflora becoming Mycoplasma and Bacteroidetes that are
   related to intestinal inflammation. Molecular analyses provided
   consistent results, wherein the expression of immune related genes was
   significantly altered. Integration of the multi-'omics' analyses
   suggested that the TLR/MyD88/ NF-kB pathway, along with PI3K-Akt-mTOR
   pathway, PPAR-mediated lipid metabolism and the autophagy signaling
   pathway, likely play important roles in initiating immunotoxic effects
   in R. philippinarum after PFOA exposure. These results provide further
   evidence that PFOA exposure can lead to immunologic dysfunction and also
   provide new insights into the mechanisms of PFAS alteration of bivalve
   immune function.},

Volume = {19},
Number = {2},
Pages = {169-178},
Abstract = {Background: The prevalence of wheeze and asthma has risen over recent
   decades for all age groups, especially children. These disorders can
   lead to decreased quality of life, missed school, urgent care and
   emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and increased health care
   costs. Environmental exposures, including pesticide exposure, are likely
   a contributing factor to this increased prevalence.
   Objective: To evaluate the association of pesticide exposure with
   childhood wheeze and asthma.
   Methods: We conducted a systematic review evaluating studies of
   pesticide exposure (measured objectively) and child respiratory
   outcomes. We searched PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCO), Scopus
   (Elsevier), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Wiley), and
   ClinicalTrials.gov from 1988 - 2021. Main search keywords included
   ``pesticides{''}, ``insecticides{''}, ``herbicides{''},
   ``respiratory{''}, ``asthma{''} and ``wheeze{''}.
   Results: Out of 5767 studies, 25 met the inclusion criteria; eight
   evaluated prenatal pesticide exposure (n=8407), twelve evaluated
   postnatal exposures (n= 50,488), and five evaluated pre-and postnatal
   exposures (n=20,919). Main pesticides investigated were
   dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) (14 studies) followed by
   organophosphates (7 studies). Primary methods of outcome assessment were
   questionnaire-based (84\%), followed by spirometry (16\%), registry
   data, and blood measures. Studies varied in the strength of evidence
   relating to study design and measures. Most studies (84\%) reported a
   positive association of exposure with adverse child respiratory health.
   Conclusion: The studies suggest an association of pesticide exposure and
   childhood wheeze and asthma. The varying results and methods reinforce
   the need for more research and standardized approaches to these studies
   to confirm the suggested association of pesticide exposure and childhood
   wheeze and asthma.},

   polyfluoroalkyl (PFASs) has been extensively studied in recent decades,
   however, almost all studies have been conducted in small areas and/or
   limited samples, which are not representative of the nationwide
   contamination of surface water environments with PFASs. In this study,
   attempt was made to provide a comprehensive report about PFASs pollution
   in Chinese surface water based on the PRISMA. By analyzing 111 papers
   published between 2006 and 2022, we provide a systematic review of the
   pollution of PFASs in surface water environments in China. The results
   show that 26 PFASs contaminants were detected at least once in China's
   surface water environment and were mainly concentrated in the eastern
   part of China. Most surface water environments in China had mean PFASs
   concentrations below 100 ng/L. The most polluted place was the Xiaoqing
   River, where sampling results in 2020 showed PFASs concentrations as
   high as 25,429 ng/L, followed by the Tangxun Lake, the Xi River, the
   Daling River, the Majia River, the Baiyangdian Lake, the Liuxi River,
   the Jiaolai River, the Tuo River and the Zhimai River. The Xiaoqing
   River also has the highest concentration of the novel pollutant, with
   concentrations of HFPO-TA and HFPO-DA as high as 1039 ng/ L and 164
   ng/L. Based on the source analysis, fluoropolymer manufacturing plants
   are the main source of PFASs pollutants in surface water. The results of
   the base risk analysis using risk quotients value (RQ) method show that
   the RQ values of the Xiaoqing River, the surface water near Bohai Bay,
   the Majia River and the Tuo River PFOA are 36.9, 7.7, 3.6 and 2.1
   respectively, which are high risk areas and require enhanced control.
   This study provides information on surface waters contaminated by PFASs
   nationwide, and the results can be used as a reference for the
   development of pollution control and management strategies for PFASs in
   surface waters in China.},

Title = {Exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and pediatric
   obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF OBESITY},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 31},
Abstract = {IntroductionPerfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are
   potentially obesogenic for children. We undertook a systematic review to
   synthesize this literature and explore sources of heterogeneity in
   previously published epidemiological studies.MethodsStudies that
   collected individual-level PFAS and anthropometric data from children up
   to 12 years of age were identified by searching six databases. We
   excluded studies that only evaluated obesity measures at the time of
   birth. A full-text review and quality assessment of the studies was
   performed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT)
   criteria. Forest plots were created to summarize measures of association
   and assess heterogeneity across studies by chemical type and exposure
   timing. Funnel plots were used to assess small-study effects.ResultsWe
   identified 24 studies, of which 19 used a cohort design. There were 13
   studies included in the meta-analysis examining various chemicals and
   outcomes. Overall prenatal exposures to four different types of PFAS
   were not statistically associated with changes in body mass index (BMI)
   or waist circumference. In contrast, for three chemicals, postnatal
   exposures were inversely related to changes in BMI (i.e., per log10
   increase in PFOS: BMI z-score of -0.16 (95\% CI: -0.22, -0.10)). There
   was no substantial heterogeneity in the reported measures of association
   within prenatal and postnatal subgroups. We observed modest small-study
   effects, but correction for these effects using the Trim and Fill method
   did not change our summary estimate(s).ConclusionOur review found no
   evidence of a positive association between prenatal PFAS exposure and
   pediatric obesity, whereas an inverse association was found for
   postnatal exposure. These findings should be interpreted cautiously due
   to the small number of studies. Future research that can inform on the
   effects of exposure mixtures, the timing of the exposure, outcome
   measures, and the shape of the exposure-response curve is needed.},

Abstract = {Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) such as
   dichlorodimethyltrichloroethane (DDT) are present and ubiquitous in the
   environment due to their resilient nature. DDT is a prevalent endocrine
   disruptor still found in detectable amounts in organisms and the
   environment even after its use was banned in the 1970s. Medline and
   Google Scholar were systematically searched to detect all relevant
   animal and human studies published in the last 20 years (January 2003 to
   February 2023) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. In total, 38
   studies were included for qualitative synthesis. This systematic search
   and review indicated that exposure to DDT is associated with female
   reproductive health issues, such as reduced fecundability; increased
   risk of preterm/premature deliveries; increased periods of gestation;
   alterations in the synthesis of crucial reproductive hormones
   (Progesterone and Oxytocin) through ion imbalances and changes in
   prostaglandin synthesis, myometrial and stromal hypertrophy, and edema;
   and variations in uterine contractions through increased uterine wet
   weight. There was also limited evidence indicating DDT as a carcinogen
   sufficient to instigate reproductive cancers. However, this review only
   takes into account the in vitro studies that have established a possible
   pathway to understand how DDT impacts female infertility and leads to
   reproductive cancers. Links between the pathways described in various
   studies have been developed in this review to produce a summarized
   picture of how one event might lead to another. Additionally,
   epidemiological studies that specifically targeted the exposure to DDT
   of females belonging to various ethnicities have been reviewed to
   develop an overall picture of prevailing female reproductive health
   concerns in different nations.},

Abstract = {Mitotane is a chiral drug used to treat adrenocortical carcinoma, being
   metabolized to the o,p'-dichlorodiphenyl acetic acid (o,p'-DDA), also a
   chiral compound. Despite of its therapeutic significance, the overall
   ratios and enantiomers have not been known. In this study, we analyzed
   the enantiomers of mitotane and o,p'-DDA in the plasma of patients by a
   newly developed chiral-phase method employed in two-dimensional
   chromatography. Important differences were observed in the ratio of
   (S)/(R)-mitotane, which varied substantially from 1:1.2 to 1:10 whereas
   the (S)/(R)-o,p'-DDA ratio was relatively conserved, at approximately
   2:1. These findings provide evidence for the enantioselective metabolism
   and provide a method for further analyses of mitotane and metabolites,
   which can explain the variation in the therapeutic response.},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Ambient air pollution, containing numerous known and hitherto unknown
   compounds, is a major risk factor for public health. The discovery of
   harmful components is the prerequisite for pollution control; however,
   this raises a great challenge on recognizing previously unknown species.
   Here we systematically review the analytical techniques on air pollution
   in the framework of an omics approach, with a brief introduction on
   sample preparation and analysis, and in more detail, compounds
   prioritization and identification. Through high-resolution mass
   spectrometry (HRMS, typically coupled with chromatography), the
   complicated environmental matrix can be digitalized into
   ``full-component{''} data. A key step to discover emerging compounds is
   the prioritization of compounds from massive data. Chemical
   fingerprints, suspect lists and biological effects are the most vital
   untargeted strategies for comprehensively screening critical and
   hazardous substances. Afterward, compressed data of compounds can be
   identified at various confidence levels according to exact mass and the
   derived molecular formula, MS libraries, and authentic standards. Such
   an omics approach on full-component data provides a paradigm for
   discovering emerging air pollutants; nonetheless, new technological
   advancements of instruments and databases are warranted for further
   tracking the environmental behaviors, hence to evaluate the health risk
   of key pollutants. (C) Higher Education Press 2023},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {905},

Abstract = {Emerging pollutants (EPs) emerged as a group of new compounds whose
   presence in the environment has been widely detected in Mexico. In this
   country, different concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds,
   pesticides, dyes, and microplastics have been reported, which vary
   depending on the region and the analyzed matrix (i.e., wastewater,
   surface water, groundwater). The evidence of the EPs' presence focuses
   on the detection of them, but there is a gap in information regarding is
   biomonitoring and their effects in health in Mexico. The presence of
   these pollutants in the country associated with lack of proper
   regulations in the discharge and disposal of EPs. Therefore, this review
   aims to provide a comprehensive view of the current environmental
   status, policies, and frameworks regarding Mexico's situation. The
   review also highlights the lack of information about biomonitoring since
   EPs are present in water even after their treatment, leading to a
   critical situation, which is high exposure to humans and animals.
   Although, technologies to efficiently eliminate EPs are available, their
   application has been reported only at a laboratory scale thus far. Here,
   an overview of health and environmental impacts and a summary of the
   research works reported in Mexico from 2014 to 2023 were presented. This
   review concludes with a concrete point of view and perspective on the
   status of the EPs' research in Mexico as an alert for government
   entities about the necessity of measures to control the EPs disposal and
   treatment.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {177},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Perfluorohexyl sulfonate (PFHxS) is the third most abundant per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances and its developmental toxicity remains very
   poorly understood. Here, pregnant mice exposed to PFHxS at human
   relevant dose showed increased fetal death incidence in the high-dose
   PFHxS-H group (P < 0.01). Body distribution analyses suggested that
   PFHxS crossed the placental barrier reaching the fetus in a
   dose-dependent manner. Histopathological data demonstrated impairment in
   the placenta with reduced blood sinus volume, placental labyrinth area
   as well as thickness of labyrinthine layer. Further lipidomic and
   transcriptomic data together showed that PFHxS exposure caused
   significant disruption in placental lipid homeostasis, including total
   lipid accumulation in the placenta, and dysregulation in phospholipid
   and glycerol lipid metabolism. Gene expression analyses uncovered
   elevation in key placental fatty acid transporters including op2,
   whereas protein expression showed transporter specific disruptions
   following exposure. Together, gestational exposure to human relevant
   level of PFHxS may increase the incidence of fetal deaths and caused
   placental dysplasia via disruption in lipid metabolism homeostasis.
   These findings raise the concern regarding the highly prevalent and
   persistent chemical towards early sensitive developing stages and
   provide basis for further understanding of its effects on lipid
   metabolism and underlying mechanisms.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY LETTERS},

Abstract = {A network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to explore associations
   between fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH) transformation and factors
   affecting perfluoroalkyl carboxylate (PFCA) evolution in synthetic and
   environmental media. Data were extracted from a total of 14 primary
   research articles aligned with bench-scale investigations into 6:2
   and/or 8:2 FTOH biotransformation; these data were subjected to a random
   effect NMA to simultaneously evaluate influences of various experimental
   conditions on biotransformation. Effectiveness rankings were used to
   summarize experimental conditions promoting FTOH to PFCA transformation
   from the greatest to least effect on conversion. Results related to
   atmospheric conditions and/or electron accepting processes (from
   greatest to least effect on PFCA formation) are as follows: aerobic,
   nitrate reducing conditions, microoxic, anaerobic (unamended electron
   acceptor {[}EA]), sulfate reducing conditions, and iron reducing
   conditions. A greater association with PFCA formation was observed under
   mesophilic conditions compared to psychrophilic conditions. Multiple
   conditions that promote FTOH to PFCA bioconversion in environmental
   matrices were identified in this study. Several conditions under which
   transformation is unlikely have also been identified, suggesting the
   possibility of long-term FTOH retention in impacted media with limited
   short- and long-chain PFCA mobilization. Our findings further suggest
   the need for advancing our understanding of FTOH transformation in media
   receiving excessive nitrogen from anthropogenic sources.},

Volume = {29},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Due to anthropogenic activities, a large number of pollutants are
   disposed into the environment. The microbial communities in the
   environment are immensely diverse and critical mediators of various
   ecosystem processes. But it is not clearly known to what extent
   xenobiotics effect the composition and functionality of environmental
   microorganisms, across biomes in different geographic locations, with
   varying contaminating sources, categories of chemical pollutants, and
   their application types. Here, we investigated the impact of xenobiotics
   by meta-genomic analysis of 16S rRNA from seawater, soil, sludge and
   sediment, for deciphering microbial diversity, community structure,
   functional enrichment and metabolic potentiality in relation to the
   application of pesticide (metaldehyde), herbicide
   (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; DCPAA), insecticide (chlordecone) and
   flame retar-dant additives (organophosphate triesters; OPT and tris 2
   chloroethyl phosphate; TCEP). Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum
   consisting of Clostridia, in association with DCPAA (Lutispora sp.),
   metaldehyde and TCEP treatments. The next two abundant phyla were
   Proteobacteria {[}class Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria
   (Pelagibacter ubique with OPT treatment) and Gammaproteobacteria], and
   Euryarchaeota consisting mostly of Methanobacteria with chlordecone and
   DCPAA. Both Desulfomicrobium and Sedimentibacter were predominant in the
   subtropical moist forest sediment, while Synechococcus and Pelagibacter
   dominated the temperate Mediterranean Sea. Ruminococcus and Lutispora
   were more abundant in rain forest compared to waste water solid, while
   Anaerovorax predominated subtropical moist forest. Sequences involved in
   house-keeping genes comprised the most abundant hits. The genes involved
   in environmental information processing such as ABC transporters
   catalyzing carbohydrate uptake, membrane transport and quorum sensing
   were over-represented with TCEP, DCPAA, OPT and metaldehyde. Exposure to
   different classes of xenobiotics revealed major differ-ences in
   microbial structure and function abundances, mainly driven by
   environmental sources and biomes. Preponderance of core metabolic
   functional genes across all the metagenomes analysed is indicative of
   microbial community responding and adjusting itself to deal with these
   treatments and maintain its balance.},

Abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are deemed major conveyors and point
   sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to the
   environment. This statistical meta-analysis of existing literature from
   the past 15 years focused on the significance of treatment type for PFAS
   removal efficiencies and the influence of PFAS sources (domestic vs.
   industrial) on their removal. Different sampling events, WWTPs across
   the world, different treatment technologies, configurations, and
   processes, as well as different PFAS classes and compounds were
   considered. This study evaluated 13 PFAS analyzed predominantly in 161
   WWTPs across the world. The statistical test results revealed that these
   13 frequently detected and reported PFAS can be divided into four groups
   based on their behavior during wastewater treatment, namely (1) C6-10
   perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), (2) C4,5,11,12 PFCAs, (3) C4,6,8
   perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and (4) C10 PFSA. In this study,
   biological treatments such as (1) membrane bioreactors, (2) combination
   of two or more biological treatments, and (3) biofilm processes revealed
   the highest PFAS removals, although the addition of a tertiary treatment
   actually had a nonbeneficial effect on PFAS removal. Moreover, a strong
   statistical correlation was observed between industrial wastewater
   sources and the presence of high influent PFAS concentrations in the
   receiving WWTPs. This indicates that industrial sources were the main
   contributors of the PFAS load in the analyzed WWTPs. Integr Environ

Title = {Evaluating the efficiency of nanofiltration and reverse osmosis membrane
   processes for the removal of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances from
   water: A critical review},
Journal = {SEPARATION AND PURIFICATION TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {302},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been ubiquitously
   detected in the aquatic environment which poses a risk for human
   exposure. The recalcitrant behavior of PFAS to most traditional water
   treatment processes calls for development of novel or modified treatment
   approaches for effective PFAS elimination. Currently, highpressure
   membrane systems, including nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO)
   are among the most promising and readily applied technologies for PFAS
   removal. In this review, we summarized peer-reviewed scientific articles
   on the development and use of 20 different types of commercial and 6
   synthesized/modified NF and RO membranes in terms of PFAS removal
   efficacy. Synthesizing of existing knowledge shows that under
   environmentally relevant pH and concentration, NF and RO can effectively
   remove PFAS from water. The impact of PFAS molecular weight (MW) and
   functionality, membrane characteristics, feed water constitution,
   natural organic matters and operational conditions were systematically
   reviewed and evaluated. Moving forward, we recommend additional research
   dedicated to understanding the behaviors of PFAS alternatives and other
   overlooked compounds (e.g., PFAS with chain length C2 and C3) during NF

   expected to assist researchers and water quality managers investigating

Abstract = {Elderly individuals are often affected by osteoporosis and have poor
   stability after fracture reduction. Moreover, there is still controversy
   regarding the clinical effects of the treatment for unstable
   intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. The Cochrane, Embase,
   PubMed, and other databases were searched, and a meta-analysis of the
   literature on the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures of
   the elderly with InterTan, PFNA, and PFNA-II was conducted. Seven
   studies were screened, with a total of 1236 patients. Our meta-analysis
   results show that InterTan is not significantly different from PFNA in
   terms of operation and fluoroscopy times, but it takes longer than
   PFNA-II. In terms of postoperative screw cut, pain, femoral shaft
   fracture, and secondary operations, InterTan is superior to PFNA and
   PFNA-II. Conversely, in terms of intraoperative blood loss, hospital
   stay, and postoperative Harris score, there is no significant difference
   between InterTan and PFNA and PFNA-II. Compared to PFNA and PFNA-II,
   InterTan internal fixation has advantages in the treatment of unstable
   intertrochanteric fractures in elderly individuals in terms of screw
   cutting, femoral shaft fractures, and secondary operations. However,
   InterTan operation and fluoroscopy times take longer than PFNA and
   PFNA-II.},

Abstract = {We investigated the distribution of 8 per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFASs) in 321 shellfish samples collected from four coastal
   cities along the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea of Shandong Province, China.
   The concentrations of total PFASs ( n-ary sumation PFASs) were in the
   range of 0.061-178.259 ng/g wet weight (ww). Two legacy long-chain
   compounds were dominant. Three emerging compounds and two short-chain
   alternatives were also observed with higher concentration and detection
   frequency than in previous studies, whereas 4,
   8-dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoate acid (ADONA) was not detected. There were
   differences in concentrations and composition profiles of PFASs among
   different species, as well as among different sampling cities. According
   to scores of principal component analysis, metal plating plants, textile
   treatments, and fluoropolymer products were considered as the main
   sources of PFAS contamination in shellfish. Furthermore, a potential
   health risk of perfluorooctanoic acid should be highly considered for
   local residents that frequently consume crabs and molluscs.},

   Spectrometry},
Journal = {MOLECULES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {28},
Number = {9},
Month = {APR 27},
Abstract = {Although dicofol has been widely banned all over the world as a kind of
   organochlorine contaminant, it still exists in the environment. This
   study developed a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with
   mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) detection technique for dicofol, an
   environmental pollutant, for the first time using in-source
   fragmentation. The results confirmed that m/z 251 was the only precursor
   ion of dicofol after in-source fragmentation, and m/z 139 and m/z 111
   were reasonable product ions. The main factors triggering the in-source
   fragmentation were the H+ content and solution conductivity when dicofol
   entered the mass spectrometer. Density functional theory can be used to
   analyze and interpret the mechanism of dicofol fragmentation reaction in
   ESI source. Dicofol reduced the molecular energy from 8.8 +/- 0.05
   kcal/mol to 1.0 +/- 0.05 kcal/mol, indicating that the internal energy
   release from high to low was the key driving force of in-source
   fragmentation. A method based on HPLC-MS/MS was developed to analyze
   dicofol residues in environmental water. The LOQ was 0.1 mu g/L, which
   was better than the previous GC or GC-MS methods. This study not only
   proposed an HPLC-MS/MS analysis method for dicofol for the first time
   but also explained the in-source fragmentation mechanism of compounds in
   ESI source, which has positive significance for the study of compounds
   with unconventional mass spectrometry behavior in the field of organic
   pollutant analysis and metabonomics.},

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of toxic,
   ubiquitous, anthropogenic chemicals known to bioaccumulate in humans.
   Substantial concern exists regarding the human health effects of PFAS,
   particularly metabolic syndrome (MetS), a precursor to cardiovascular
   disease, the leading cause of mortality worldwide. This narrative review
   provides an overview of the PFAS literature on 4 specific components of
   MetS: insulin resistance/glucose dysregulation, central adiposity,
   dyslipidemia, and blood pressure. We focus on prospective cohort studies
   as these provide the best body of evidence compared to other study
   designs. Available evidence suggests potential associations between some
   PFAS and type-2 diabetes in adults, dyslipidemia in children and adults,
   and blood pressure in adults. Additionally, some studies found that sex
   and physical activity may modify these relationships. Future studies
   should consider modification by sex and lifestyle factors (e.g., diet
   and physical activity), as well quantifying the impact of PFAS mixtures
   on MetS features and related clinical disease. Finally, clinicians can
   follow recently developed clinical guidance to screen for PFAS exposure
   in patients, measure PFAS levels, conduct additional clinical care based
   on PFAS levels, and advise on PFAS exposure reduction.},

Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) constitute a large class of
   toxic manmade compounds that have been used in many industrial and
   household products. Dispersion of PFAS in the environment has raised
   concerns because of their persistence and toxicity for living organisms.
   Both terrestrial and aquatic plants have been shown to take up PFAS from
   contaminated soil and groundwater, and to accumulate these compounds
   inside their tissues. Although PFAS generally exert a low toxicity on
   plants at environmentally relevant concentrations, they frequently
   impact biomass growth and photosynthetic activity at higher levels.
   Uptake, translocation, and toxicity of PFAS in plants have been well
   covered in literature. Although less attention has been given to the
   molecular mechanisms underlying the plant response to PFAS, recent
   studies based on -omics approaches indicate that PFAS affects the plant
   metabolism even a low concentration. The objective of this review is to
   summarize the current knowledge about the effects of PFAS on plants at
   the molecular level. Results from recent transcriptomics, proteomics,
   and metabolomics studies show that low levels of PFAS induce oxidative
   stress and affect multiple plant functions and processes, including
   photosynthesis and energy metabolism. These potentially harmful effects
   trigger activation of defense mechanisms.
   NOVELTY STATEMENTAlthough the uptake, translocation, and toxicity of
   per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in plants have been well

   mechanisms underlying the plant response to PFAS. Using results from
   recent transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics studies, this
   review article aims to summarize the current knowledge about the effects
   of PFAS on plants at the molecular level. Several reviews have been
   published on the effects of PFAS on plants, however, none have focused
   specifically on the molecular mechanisms of PFAS phytotoxicity.},

Abstract = {Perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous environmental
   contaminants that are widely used in consumer products and fire
   suppression foams. The presence of PFAS in ground and surface water can
   create a route for PFAS to enter the soil, exposing ecosystems
   (including agroecosystems), where they will move through the food web
   via biomagnification. The toxicity of PFAS to plants, particularly in
   agricultural ecosystems, is of emerging concern due to the application
   of biosolids that are often contaminated with PFAS. Nevertheless, due to
   the low concentrations of PFAS in most agricultural soils, the direct
   impact of PFAS on plant health is not well understood. We used
   H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to explore the effects
   of exposure of two key PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and
   perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism.
   We found that Arabidopsis exhibited an accumulation of multiple
   metabolites, including soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose), multiple
   amino acids, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates,
   suggesting that PFAS exposure impacts the metabolism of plants by
   causing an accumulation of stress-related amino acids and soluble sugars
   that drives increased activity of the TCA cycle. The present study shows
   that H-1-NMR metabolomics is a viable tool for investigating changes in
   the metabolic profile of plants exposed to PFAS and can be used to
   illuminate the stress response of plants in a high-throughput, nonbiased
   manner. Environ Toxicol Chem 2022;00:1-10. (c) 2022 SETAC},

Abstract = {The impact of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances on microbial
   communities is challenging to investigate in situ because of the
   complexity and dynamics of natural ecosystems. In the present study,
   four microcosms were estab-lished to explore the impact of
   perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) on bacterial communities in riverine and
   marine settings. PFOA distribution between the aqueous and sedimentary
   phases fluctuated in both PFOA-amended and unamended control systems.
   PFOA was more rapidly partitioned into the sediment in marine than in
   riverine microcosms. Differ-ences in iron concentration and salinity may
   influence PFOA exchange between water and sediment. In marine
   micro-cosms, the alpha diversity of bacterial communities was
   significantly correlated to PFOA concentration. PFOA tended to correlate
   more strongly with bacterial community composition in water than in
   sediment. At the whole system level, Lefse's analysis indicated
   Algoriphagus halophilus as biomarkers for PFOA exposure in both riverine
   and marine systems, and the family Flavobacteriaceae were also more
   abundant in the exposed systems. In terms of temporal variation
   (comparison between three time points in the systems), metastat analysis
   showed great variability of potential PFOA-sensitive bacteria at the
   genus level. As such, most PFOA-sensitive genera were transitory and
   variable and existed for a short term in different systems (river, sea,
   blank, and experiment) and phases. Compared with other PFOA-sensitive
   genera, we suggest that further research is carried out to explore the
   use of Limnobacter as a bioindicator for temporal monitoring of PFOA
   pollution.},

   perfluorooctanesulfonic acid: An integrated multi-omics analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {173},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Emerging epidemiological evidence has linked per-and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS) exposure could be linked to the disturbance of
   gestational glucolipid metabolism, but the toxicological mechanism is
   unclear, especially when the exposure is at a low level. This study
   examined the glucolipid metabolic changes in pregnant rats treated with
   relatively low dose perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) through oral
   gavage during pregnancy {[}gestational day (GD): 1-18]. We explored the
   molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic perturbation. Oral glucose
   tolerance test (OGTT) and biochemical tests were performed to assess the
   glucose homeostasis and serum lipid profiles in pregnant Sprague-Dawley
   (SD) rats randomly assigned to starch, 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg.bw.d groups.
   Transcriptome sequencing combined with non-targeted metabolomic assays
   were further performed to identify differentially altered genes an d
   metabolites in the liver of maternal rats, and to determine their
   corre-lation with the maternal metabolic phenotypes. Results of
   transcriptome showed that differentially expressed genes at 0.03 and 0.3
   mg/kg.bw.d PFOS exposure were related to several metabolic pathways,
   such as peroxi-some proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) signaling,
   ovarian steroid synthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, insulin
   resistance, cholesterol metabolism, unsaturated fatty acid synthesis,
   bile acid secretion. The untargeted metabolomics identified 164 and 158
   differential metabolites in 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg.bw.d exposure groups,
   respectively under negative ion mode of Electrospray Ionization (ESI-),
   which could be enriched in metabolic pathways such as alpha-linolenic
   acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glycerolipid metabolism,
   glucagon signaling pathway, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism.
   Co-enrichment analysis indicated that PFOS exposure may disturb the
   metabolism pathways of glycerolipid, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis,
   linoleic acid, steroid biosynthesis, glycine, serine and threonine. The
   key involved genes included down-regulated Ppp(1)r(3)c and Abcd(2), and
   up-regulated Ogdhland Ppp(1)r(3)g, and the key metabolites such as
   increased glycerol 3-phosphate and lac-tosylceramide were further
   identified. Both of them were significantly associated with maternal
   fasting blood glucose (FBG) level. Our findings may provide mechanistic
   clues for clarifying metabolic toxicity of PFOS in human, especially for
   susceptible population such as pregnant women.},

Title = {Human Evidence of Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA) Exposure on Hepatic
   Disease: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {18},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is widely used throughout
   different industries, including the food industry, because it is
   resistant to heat and prevents water or oil from easily permeating into
   or contaminating materials coated by PFOA. Although many studies have
   reported an association between PFOA exposure and the risk of developing
   hepatic diseases, it is still in debate because they have shown
   conflicting results. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review
   and meta-analysis on the relationship between PFOA exposure and hepatic
   diseases. Methods: This study searched studies related to hepatic
   diseases due to PFOA exposure until 31 December 2021, using PubMed,
   EMBASE, and Web of Science. This study performed a systematic review and
   meta-analysis through research question development, literature
   screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation. This study
   found 8280 studies after excluding duplicate literature and selected 5
   studies in the final stage. Among them, two studies were included in the
   meta-analysis. Results: The results of the meta-analysis showed that the
   ALT of people exposed to PFOA was 117\% higher than the ALT of those not
   exposed to PFOA, and it was significantly different (OR = 1.167; 95\%
   CI, 1.086-1.254). Conclusion: However, since the number of studies
   included in the analysis was not large enough to conclude that PFOA
   exposure was associated with the development of hepatic diseases, more
   observational studies are needed to confirm its long-term effects.},

Journal = {CHEMISTRYSELECT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {8},
Number = {20},
Month = {MAY 25},
Abstract = {Photocatalysis is considered as promising methodology for the removal of
   pesticides from wastewater given its cost-effective and environmental
   benignity. Pesticide toxicity and bioaccumulation have brought up
   environmental issues, underlining the necessity for efficient removal
   techniques based on novel nanomaterials. Herein, biochar (BC)
   synthesized by using waste peels of citrus limetta embedded with green
   synthesized Fe2O3 nanoparticle by using green tea extract. By using PXRD
   analysis, the alpha phase of Fe2O3 confirmed. Endosulfan (ES) and Ethion
   (ET) pesticides are degraded photocatalytically using a sequential, BC@
   Fe2O3 nanohybrid. At the pollutant concentration (50 mg L-1), with
   catalytic dose (25 mg) in acidic condition under natural sunlight, BC@
   Fe2O3 showed to be extremely effective in the breakdown of pesticides.
   The higher removal of pesticides by BC@ Fe2O3 supported by higher value
   of zeta potential (-22.5 mV), enhanced surface area (74 m(2) g(-1)) and
   lower value of band gap (1.8 eV) as an effect of interactive
   characteristic and semiconducting behaviour. The fast decline in
   pesticide concentration followed by a gradual decrease demonstrated I-st
   order kinetics triggered by Langmuir adsorption. The availability of
   active species such as oxygen(,) hydroxyl radicals and holes, which are
   liable for pesticide breakdown, proved by scavenger analysis. Formation
   of safer metabolites during the photocatalytic studies confirmed by the
   LC-MS studies. Finally, modified BC@ Fe2O3 nanohybrid may prove to be a
   viable alternative catalyst for industrial applications due to their
   reusability (n=7), charge separation, stability and high surface
   activity.},

Title = {Association between prenatal exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances and neurodevelopment in children: Evidence based on birth
   cohort},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {236},
Number = {2},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Background: Although numerous studies have examined the effect of
   prenatal per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure on
   neurodevelopment in children, findings have been inconsistent.
   Objective: To better understand the effects of PFAS exposure during
   pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopment, we conducted a systematic
   review of prenatal exposure to different types of PFAS and
   neurodevelopment in children.Methods: A comprehensive search was
   conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE electronic databases
   up to March 2023. Only birth cohort studies that report a specific
   association between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and neurodevelopment
   were included in this review.Results: 31 birth cohort studies that met
   the inclusion criteria were qualitatively integrated. Among these, 14
   studies investigated the impact of PFAS exposure during pregnancy on
   cognition, 13 on neurobehavior, and 4 on both cognition and
   neurobehavior. Additionally, 4 studies explored the influence of PFAS on
   children's comprehensive development.Conclusion: Prenatal PFAS exposure
   was associated with poor neurodevelopment in children, including
   psychomotor development, externalizing behavior, and comprehensive
   development. However, conclusive evidence regarding its effects on other
   neurological outcomes remains limited. In addition, sex-specific effects
   on social behavior and sleep problems were identified.},

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are a group of organic compounds that
   have a molecular structure containing carbon and their chemical
   properties allow them to be easily converted to steam and gas and remain
   for a long period of time and have diverse effects on the environment.
   The purpose of this study is determination of the concentration of VOCs
   such as alachlor, anthracene, benzene, bromoform, chloroform,
   heptachlor, isophorone, tetrachloroethylene, gamma-chlordane, toluene,
   etc. in water matrices. The results showed that among studies conducted
   on VOCs, the concentration of tetrachloroethylene, m,p-xylene, and
   toluene were at the top in water matrices, and the lowest average
   concentrations were found in chloroform, anthracene, and butyl benzyl
   phthalate. In terms of VOC concentrations in water matrices, China was
   the most polluted country. Moreover, the data analysis indicated that
   China was the only country with carcinogenic risk. A Monte-Carlo
   simulation showed that although the averages obtained were comparable to
   the acceptable limits, for heptachlor, the maximum carcinogenic risk is
   achieved at a level that is slightly over the limit, only 25\% from the
   population being exposed.},

Title = {A Review of Analytical Methods and Technologies for Monitoring Per- and
   Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) in Water},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {20},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) consist of a range of
   manufactured fluorinated chemicals that are used in a variety of
   household and waterproofing products, industrial processes, and
   firefighting foams. In the past few years, there has been increasing
   concern about PFAS in the environment, since they are difficult to break
   down through natural processes, are highly persistent in humans,
   animals, soils and waters, and can travel long distances in surface and
   groundwater. This has created an increased need for PFAS analysis. Most
   PFAS monitoring currently takes place using field sampling and
   chromatographic analytical methods, which are laboratory-based and are
   very costly when used to monitor PFAS in the environment. Using a
   semi-systematic literature review approach, a comparative study is
   conducted in this article on the available analytical methods and sensor
   technologies that can be used to monitor and detect PFAS in the
   environment, including chromatographic, instrumentation analysis, and
   sensor-based methods. This study considered four critical factors for
   effective and efficient monitoring methods, which include the type of
   PFAS detected, removing background levels, determining detection limits,
   and identifying samples. In general, other analytical instruments are
   used in conjunction with chromatographic techniques for detecting both
   target and non-target analytes at a lower level of detection (LOD). It
   is shown that even though some sensor types have a low LOD, they are
   only useful for detecting targeted PFAS in water samples. However,
   sensors are an emerging technology that could be developed to enable
   low-cost, portable methods for the remote detection of PFAS species
   on-site.},

Abstract = {Relevance. The new data on the organochlorine pesticides pollution of
   the bottom sediments of Nakhodka bay and Partizanskaya river were
   obtained in 2020-2021. The objective of the article is to report the
   organochlorine pesticides pollution level of the bottom sediments and to
   define the possible sources of organochlorine pesticides in the marine

   processing, assessment of the organochlorine pesticides contamination of
   sediments Results. The new data were obtained on the organochlorine
   pesticides concentrations in Nakhodka bay in 2020-2021. The previous
   data on the studied area are described. The concentration of HCH
   pesticides (alpha-, beta-and gamma-HCH), DDT and its metabolites was
   analyzed. It was found that the concentration of alpha-, beta-HCCH and
   DDT in bottom sediments increased in 2021.To determine the quality of
   bottom sediments, the average annual values of organochlorine pesticides
   concentrations in the bottom sediments gathered during the field works
   were compared with the quality guidelines. There are no approved quality
   guidelines for maximum permissible concentrations of pollutants in
   bottom sediments in the Russian Federation. For this reason, the quality
   guidelines applied in foreign countries (<< Dutch sheets >> (Neue
   Niederlandische Liste, NNL) and Canadian quality standards for marine
   and estuarine bottom sediments (Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines,
   CSQGs)) were used. Possible sources of organochlorine pesticides in the
   marine environment were analyzed. The results of this work showed that
   despite the ban on the use of these substances, these pesticides are
   included in the multiple compounds used in different industries and
   continue to enter and accumulate in the marine environment.},

Abstract = {Patient harm due to unsafe healthcare is widespread, potentially

   the World Health Organization (WHO) published the Global Patient Safety

   several measures, including `never events', `serious incidents',
   `patient safety events' and coroners' Prevention of Future Deaths
   reports (PFDs) to monitor healthcare quality and safety. We conducted a
   systematic narrative review of PubMed and medRxiv on 19 February 2023 to
   explore the strengths and limitations of coroners' PFDs and whether they
   could be a safety tool to help meet the WHO's Global Patient Safety
   Action Plan. We identified 17 studies that investigated a range of PFDs,
   including preventable deaths involving medicines and an assessment
   during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that PFDs offered important
   information that could support hospitals to improve patient safety and
   prevent deaths. However, inconsistent reporting, low response rates to
   PFDs, and difficulty in accessing, analysing and monitoring PFDs limited
   their use and adoption as a patient safety tool for hospitals. To fulfil
   the potential of PFDs, a national system is required that develops
   guidelines, sanctions failed responses and embeds technology to
   encourage the prevention of future deaths.},

Abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is ubiquitous in aquatic environment,
   posing serious threats to human health, while the potential of anaerobic
   ammonium oxidation (anammox) process in treating PFOA-containing
   waste-water and the response mechanism of anammox consortia to PFOA
   remain unknown. In this study, the comprehensive effects of PFOA on
   anammox granules and their interaction mechanism were investigated based
   on molecular simulation and metabolomic analysis. The environmental
   concentrations (<= 2.0 mg/L) of PFOA had no impact on the anammox
   process performance. However, microbial consortia structure and
   functional gene abundances changed under the exposure of PFOA. By
   contrast, Prokaryotes were more sensitive to PFOA than eukaryotes. In
   addition, PFOA regulated microbial metabolic pathways, including amino
   acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism, by changing the cell energy
   allocation strategy. Molecular docking simulation suggested that the
   effects of PFOA on key proteins in anammox bacteria were significantly
   different. These findings provide insights into the interaction between
   anammox consortia and PFOA, and further promote the implementation of
   anammox process to treat fluorine-containing wastewater.},

Volume = {17},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {The scarcity of clean water resources combined with other environmental
   and anthropogenic effects have urged the development of advanced
   technology for wastewater treatment. Adsorption attracts great attention
   as a costeffective technique for the remediation of contaminated water.
   Despite a broad variety of adsorbents existing in the literature,
   agriculture waste-derived biosorbents appear to hold the greatest
   promise for the adsorption of emerging contaminants. Herein, this review
   introduces the recent developments of biosorbents in the adsorption
   field. The role of biosorbents in the green chemistry principle and
   their contribution towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are
   discussed. Different types of modifications of biosorbents including
   activation and modification of magnetic, non-magnetic nanoparticles and
   polymers are systematically reviewed. Besides, the application of
   modified biosorbents in the adsorption of heavy metals, dyes, PAHs and
   oils along with their respective mechanisms are analyzed. Apart from
   this, the potential practical application of biosorbents is canvassed
   through introducing simultaneous adsorption of pollutants, usage of real
   industrial wastewater matrix and reusability performance. Finally, the
   recommendations for future adsorption studies are presented. This review
   is anticipated to critically review and explore the potential of
   biosorbents as economical and green candidates for the adsorption of
   emerging pollutants.},

   Herein, we integrated metabolomics and pro-teomics analysis to
   investigate the altered profiles in metabolite and protein levels in
   primary human hepatocytes (PHH) exposed to 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS at
   human exposure relevant concentrations. Our results showed that 6:2

   metabolome and proteome than PFOS. Integration of metabolomics and
   proteomics revealed that the alteration of glycerophospholipid
   metabolism was the critical pathway of 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS-induced
   lipid metabolism disorder in primary human hepato-cytes. Interestingly,
   6:2 Cl-PFESA-induced cellular metabolic process disorder was associated
   with the cellular membrane-bounded signaling pathway, while PFOS was
   associated with the intracellular transport process. Moreover, the
   disruption effects of 6:2 Cl-PFESA were also involved in inositol

   this study provided comprehensive insights into the hepatic lipid

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are ubiquitous in environment, which have
   attracted increasing concerns in recent years. This study collected the
   data on PFAAs concentrations in 1042 soil samples from 15 countries and
   comprehensively reviewed the spatial distribution, sources, sorption
   mechanisms of PFAAs in soil and their plant uptake. PFAAs are widely
   detected in soils from many countries worldwide and their distribution
   is related to the emission of the fluorine-containing organic industry.
   Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are
   found to be the predominant PFAAs in soil. Industrial emission is the
   main source of PFAAs contributing 49.9\% of the total concentrations of
   PFAAs (Ʃ PFAAs) in soil, followed by activated sludge treated by
   wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (19.9\%) and irrigation of effluents
   from WWTPs, usage of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFFs) and leaching of
   leachate from landfill (30.2\%). The adsorption of PFAAs by soil is
   mainly influenced by soil pH, ionic strength, soil organic matter and
   minerals. The concentrations of per-fluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs)
   in soil are negatively correlated with the length of carbon chain, log
   Kow, and log Koc. The carbon chain lengths of PFAAs are negatively
   correlated with the root-soil concentration factors (RCFs) and
   shoot-soil concentration factors (SCFs). The uptake of PFAAs by plant is
   influenced by physico-chemical properties of PFAAs, plant physiology and

Abstract = {Owing to its difficulty in degrading and ease of accumulation in the
   body, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has a detrimental effect on
   reproduction. This study aimed to examine the effect of PFOA
   concentration in follicular fluid during ovulation stimulation on embryo
   quality and the impact of PFOA exposure on the metabolic components of
   follicular fluid. This was a single-center prospective study that
   included 25 patients with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), 25 with
   normal ovarian reserve (NOR), and 25 with polycystic ovary syndrome
   (PCOS). Follicular fluid samples were analyzed using ultra-high
   performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We
   demonstrated that the PFOA levels of follicular fluid in the DOR group
   were higher than those in the NOR group and PCOS group (P < 0.05). PFOA
   concentration in the PCOS group was negatively correlated with
   high-quality embryos (P < 0.05). To gain more insight into the impact of
   PFOA on the metabolic composition of follicular fluid, we classified the
   DOR group based on the PFOA concentration, for which metabolomic
   analysis was performed. In the high-concentration PFOA group, there was
   an increase and a decrease in three and nine metabolites, respectively,
   compared to that in the low-concentration group. These results suggest
   that PFOA may alter the metabolic composition of follicular fluid, thus,
   affecting ovarian reserve function.},

   in Natural and Anthropogenically Modified Environments-A Metagenomic
   Study},
Journal = {MICROORGANISMS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) pose a serious problem for the
   environment. Many are highly toxic and accumulate both in soil and in
   organisms. Their biological transformation takes place by
   dehalogenation, in which the halogen substituents are detached from the
   carbon in the organic compound by enzymes produced by microorganisms.
   This increases the compounds' water solubility and bioavailability,
   reduces toxicity, and allows the resulting compound to become more
   susceptible to biodegradation. The microbial halogen cycle in soil is an
   important part of global dehalogenation processes. The aim of the study
   was to examine the potential of microbial communities inhabiting natural
   and anthropogenically modified environments to carry out the
   dehalogenation process. The potential of microorganisms was assessed by
   analyzing the metagenomes from a natural environment (forest soils) and
   from environments subjected to anthropopression (agricultural soil and
   sludge from wastewater treatment plants). Thirteen genes encoding
   enzymes with dehalogenase activity were identified in the metagenomes of
   both environments, among which, 2-haloacid dehalogenase and catechol
   2,3-dioxygenase were the most abundant genes. Comparative analysis,
   based on comparing taxonomy, identified genes, total halogens content
   and content of DDT derivatives, demonstrated the ability of
   microorganisms to transform HOCs in both environments, indicating the
   presence of these compounds in the environment for a long period of time
   and the adaptive need to develop mechanisms for their detoxification.
   Metagenome analyses and comparative analyses indicate the genetic
   potential of microorganisms of both environments to carry out
   dehalogenation processes, including dehalogenation of anthropogenic
   HOCs.},

   41 biomarkers for L-PFOS and 32 biomarkers for P3MHpS were found and
   identified. There was no significant difference of saccharides between
   L-PFOS and P3MHpS. More amino acids were affected by P3MHpS than by
   L-PFOS in high-level exposure group, while the opposite phenomenon was
   observed in low-level exposure group. More phytohormones were affected
   by L-PFOS than by P3MHpS in the high-level exposure group, however, the
   elevated level of indole phytohormones was significantly higher by
   P3MHpS than by L-PFOS. The level of up-regulation of (poly)phenols in
   L-PFOS group was significantly higher than that in P3MHpS group. The
   affected aliphatic glucosinolate metabolism was firstly observed with
   higher up-regulation induced by L-PFOS than by P3MHpS. New insight of
   phytotoxicity of PFOS isomers to plants was provided.},

Title = {The PFAS-Tox Database: A systematic evidence map of health studies on 29
   per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {167},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Background: PFAS (per-and polyfluomalkyl substances) are a large class
   of synthetic chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial
   processes. The scientific literature on PFAS has increased dramatically
   in the last decade. Many stakeholders, including regulators, scientists,
   non-governmental organizations, and concerned individuals could benefit
   from an efficient way to access the health and toxicological literature
   related to PFAS.
   Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of the available
   peer-reviewed health or toxicological research for 29 PFAS.
   Methods: A protocol for conducting this systematic evidence map was
   initially published on Zenodo (Pelch et al. 2019c), then peer reviewed
   and published in Environment International (Pelch et al. 2019d) PubMed
   database was searched through January 25, 2021. Studies were screened
   for inclusion and exclusion according to the Populations, Exposures,
   Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement. Inclusion criteria were
   intentionally broad and included any human, animal, and/or in vitro
   study that investigated exposure to one of the 29 PFAS of interest and a
   human health or toxicological effect. Selected study details were
   extracted from included studies as described in the protocol. Study
   appraisal was not conducted. The included studies and extracted
   meta-data are freely available in the online, interactive systematic
   evidence map at https://pfastoxdatabase.org.
   Results: Over 15,000 studies were retrieved from the PubMed literature
   searches. After manual screening, 1,067 studies were identified and
   included as investigating the health or toxicological effect of one or
   more PFAS of interest. There were 505 human, 385 animal, and 220 in
   vitro studies. Summary tables of the extracted data and overall
   observations are included in this report.
   Conclusions: The PFAS-Tox Database is a useful tool for searching,
   filtering, and identifying peer reviewed research on the health and
   toxicological effects of the included PFAS. In this summary of the
   evidence map we provide examples of data gaps and clusters revealed by
   the database, with the goal of helping direct future research efforts,
   facilitate systematic reviews (e.g. on immune effects, mixtures of PFAS,
   or effects of short chain PFAS), inform regulatory risk assessments, and
   improve opportunities for cross-disciplinary coordination. We also
   discuss how this tool supports scientists, regulatory agencies, and
   other individuals by increasing awareness and access to current evidence
   regarding the health effects associated with PFAS exposure.},

Title = {Microbial bioremediation of pesticides in agricultural soils: an

   biostimulation},
Journal = {REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND BIO-TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},

Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Pesticides can impact the agriculture and environmental sector both
   positively and negatively. An over-reliance on their application to
   crops to control pests can disturb ecosystems. Therefore, the scientific
   community and policymakers must be aware of the commitment and active
   stance they need to take up to effectively elaborate on solutions toward
   mitigating environmental contamination over the coming few years. We,
   therefore, reviewed the academic literature on bioremediation from 2018
   to 2021 (the latest year of complete publication) to provide a
   meta-analysis of microbial systems capable of dissipating pesticides
   from agricultural soils. Natural attenuation can control lindane;
   however, it is time-consuming and unconvincing to scale. By introducing
   a suite of microorganisms into the system for substrate-specific
   biodegradation, we can boost the bioprocess and ultimately level up its
   cost-effectiveness. Options of microorganisms for bioaugmentation
   include the fungus Trametes versicolor and the bacteria Pigmentiphaga
   spp. and Paenanthrobacter spp. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation are
   enablers of environmental reclamation in agroecosystems. However, those
   biocatalytic strategies can be costly while manifesting as degraders to
   ecological sustainability. For instance, allochthonous and recombinant
   microorganisms can reduce genetic diversity by promoting antagonistic
   relationships. In addition, some stimulant minerals can be more toxic
   and harmful to beneficial non-target organisms than the target
   pesticide. Prudence and safety are significant aspects of ensuring
   environmentally safer applications for pesticide-degrading approaches.
   Therefore, our analytical insights can provide knowledge to progress the
   field's prominence in developing high-throughput microbiological removal
   of hazardous active compounds from agricultural soils.},

Title = {Persistent organic pollutants exposure and risk of autism spectrum
   disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {336},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Accumulating number of epidemiological studies has recently proposed
   that improvement in the risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is
   associated with persistent organic pollutants (POPs) exposure. However,
   evidence from current researches is limited and inconsistent. Thus, we
   conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the
   potential associations comprehensively. We systematically and
   extensively searched two electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) from
   inception to July 3, 2022 and an updated search was performed before
   submission. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals
   (CIs) were derived from stratified random-effects meta-analyses by type
   of exposure and outcome. We also tested the potential heterogeneity
   across studies, conducted sensitivity analysis and evaluated publication
   bias. A total of 20 studies were finally included in our study.
   Meta-analytical effect estimates indicated a positive association
   between prenatal exposure to PCB138, PCB-153 and PCB-170 and an
   increased risk of ASD, with OR of 1.89 (95\% CI = 1.21-2.95, I2 = 0\%),
   1.61 (95\% CI = 1.05-2.47, I2 = 0\%) and 1.46 (95\% CI = 1.03-2.06, I2 =
   0\%) respectively. In contrast, PFDA was found inversely associated with
   the risk of ASD (OR = 0.70, 95\% CI = 0.52-0.94, I2 = 0\%). The level of
   evidence supporting a link between ASD risk and exposure to PCB-138,
   PCB-153, PCB-170, and PFDA was respectively categorized as low, low,
   moderate, and low. In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis
   suggest that exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-170 correlates with a
   heightened risk of ASD, with evidence levels rated as ``low{''},
   ``low{''}, and ``moderate{''}, respectively. In contrast, PFDA exposure
   appears to be inversely associated with ASD risk, with a ``low{''} level
   of supporting evidence. However, due to the limited number of studies
   available for each exposure and outcome pairing, these results should be
   interpreted with caution. Sufficiently powered studies are needed to
   validate our findings.},

   Exposed to PFOS and Fed Soluble and Insoluble Dietary Fibers},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {130},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent
   environmental pollutant that has become a significant concern around the
   world. Exposure to PFOS may alter gut microbiota and liver metabolic
   homeostasis in tammals, thereby increasing the risk of cardiometabolic
   diseases. Diets high in soluble fibers can ameliorate metabolic disease
   risks. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the hypothesis that soluble fibers
   (inulin or pectin) could modulate he adverse metabolic effects of PFOS
   by affecting microbe-liver metabolism and interactions. METHODS: Male
   C57BL/6J mice were fed an isocaloric diet containing different fibers:
   a) inulin (soluble), h) pectin (soluble), or c) cellulose (control,
   insoluble). The mice were exposed to PFOS in drinking water (3 ttgig per
   day) for 7 wk. Multi-omics was used to analyze mouse liver and cecum
   contents. RESULTS: In PFOS-exposed mice, the number of differentially
   expressed genes associated with atherogenesis and hepatic hyperlipidemia
   were lower in those that were fed soluble fiber than those fed insoluble
   fiber. Shotgun metagenomics showed that inulin and pectin protected
   against differences in microbiome community in PFOS-exposed vs. control
   mice. It was found that the plasma PFOS levels were lower in inulin-fed
   mice, and there was a trend of lower liver accumulation of PFOS in
   soluble fiber-fed mice compared with the control group. Soluble fiber
   intake ameliorated the effects of PFOS on host hepatic metabolism gene
   expression and cecal content microbiome structure. DISCUSSIONS: Results
   from metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic studies suggest that
   inulin- and pectin-fed mice were less susceptible-to PFOS-induced liver
   metabolic disturbance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and transcriptional
   changes compared with control diet-fed mice. Our study advances the
   understanding of interaction between microbes and host under the
   influences of environmental pollutants and nutrients. The results
   provide new insights into the microbe-liver metabolic network and the
   protection against environmental pollutant-induced metabolic diseases by
   highfiber diets.},

   substances},
Journal = {CRITICAL REVIEWS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY},

Abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) industry is expanding rapidly in the
   context of addressing the challenge of climate change and energy crisis.
   As a technology-intensive product, large number of new synthetic
   chemicals are applied in LIBs production. Organic fluorine additives are
   added in multiple components of LIBs, many of these additives are novel
   per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (with fully fluorinated methyl or
   methylene carbon atom), here, in this work we referred to this kind of
   compounds as LIB-PFAS. LIB-PFAS may cause high exposure to personnel in
   contact with LIBs materials during production and disposal processes,
   thus posing potential health risks to these occupational workers. The
   general population can be exposed to LIB-PFAS when they are released
   into the surrounding air, soil, and water. In order to assess potential
   health risks associated with LIB-PFAS, this review systematically
   summarizes the chemical structures, analytical methods, possible
   emission routes and human exposure pathways, their bioaccumulation,
   distribution, and elimination behaviors in humans, and existing toxicity
   data of LIB-PFAS. In particular, the screening and identification
   methods for 57 LIB-PFAS are discussed, as well as the investigation of
   emission processes and exposure risks during the manufacturing and
   disposal of LIB. Although the available scientific data is still
   limited, this review provide an insightful view and novel perspective
   for further research on the occupational and environmental health
   impacts of LIB-PFAS.},

Abstract = {BackgroundCoroners, who hold inquests to determine the causes of
   unnatural deaths in England and Wales, having recognised factors that
   could cause other deaths, are legally obliged to signal concerns by
   sending `Reports to Prevent Future Deaths' (PFDs) to interested persons.
   We aimed to establish whether Coroners' concerns about medications are
   widely recognised.MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science
   up to 30 November, 2022 for publications linking PFDs and medications
   using a combination of search terms ``coroner{*}{''}, ``inquest{*}{''},
   ``medicine{*}{''}, ``medication{*}{''} and ``prevent{*}{''}. We also
   searched the BMJ, a UK journal that carries news items; and the
   databases Nexis Advance and News On the Web for reports in national
   newspapers between 2013 and 2022, using the search terms ({''}regulation
   28{''} OR ``prevent future deaths{''} OR ``prevention of future

   as well as their citations in Google Scholar at 23 May, 2023.ResultsOnly
   11 published papers on medicines referenced UK PFDs, nine of which were
   from our group. The BMJ carried 23 articles mentioning PFDs, five
   related to medicines. Of 139 PFDs (out of over 4000) mentioned in
   national newspapers, only nine related to medicines.ConclusionsThe PFDs
   related to medicines are not widely referred to in medical journals or
   UK national newspapers. By contrast, the Australian and New Zealand
   National Coronial Information System has contributed cases to 206
   publications cited in PubMed, of which 139 are related to medicines. Our
   search suggests that information from English and Welsh Coroners' PFDs
   is under-recognised, even though it should inform public health. The
   results of inquiries by Coroners and medical examiners worldwide into
   potentially preventable deaths involving medicines should be used to
   strengthen the safety of medicines.},

Title = {Mitochondrial dysfunction in metabolic disorders induced by per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substance mixtures in zebrafish larvae},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {176},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Several per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been linked to
   metabolic disorders in organisms. However, few studies have considered
   their combined effects, which would be more representative of PFAS
   occurring in the environment. In this study, zebrafish embryos were
   exposed to a mixture of 18 PFAS at three environmentally relevant
   concentrations for 5 days to assess their bioconcentration and metabolic
   consequences. The burdens of n-ary sumation PFAS in zebrafish larvae
   were 0.12, 1.58, and 9.63 mg/kg in the 0.5, 5, and 50 mu g/L treatment
   groups, respectively. Exposure to the PFAS mixture accelerated hatching
   and larval heart rates, increased energy expenditure, and reduced ATP
   levels and glucose contents due to decreased feed intake and glucose
   uptake. Metabolomic analysis revealed that exposure to the PFAS mixture
   enhanced glycolysis but inhibited phospholipid synthesis, and
   significantly increased the expression of lipid metabolism related genes
   (srebf1, acox, and ppar alpha), which indicated enhanced beta-oxidation.
   The significant changes in mitochondrial membrane potential,
   mitochondrial content, and the transcription of genes involved in the
   mitochondrial respiratory chain (mfn2, ndufs1, atp5fa1, and mt-nd1) and
   mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription (18rs-rrn, and polg1)
   suggested that exposure to the PFAS mixture could cause mitochondrial
   dysfunction and further disrupt glucose and lipid metabolic pathways,
   ultimately causing metabolic disorders in zebrafish larvae. These
   findings demonstrate the importance of assessing the metabolic effects
   of PFAS mixtures on early development in wildlife and humans.},

Abstract = {Intestinal cell metabolism plays an important role in intestine health.
   Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure could disorder intestinal cell
   metabolism. However, the mechanisms regarding how the three carbon
   sources interact under PFOA stress remined to be understood. The present
   study aimed to dissect the interconnections of glucose, glutamine, and
   fatty acids in PFOA-treated human colorectal cancer (DLD-1) cells using
   13C metabolic flux analysis. The abundance of glycolysis and
   tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites was decreased in PFOAtreated
   cells except for succinate, whereas most of amino acids were more
   abundant. Beside serine and glycine, the levels of metabolites derived
   from 13C glucose were reduced in PFOA-treated cells, and the pentose
   phosphate pathway flux was 1.4-fold higher in PFOA-treated cells than in
   the controls. In reductive glutamine pathway, higher labeled enrichment
   of citrate, malate, fumarate, and succinate was observed for
   PFOA-treated cells. The contribution of glucose to fatty acid synthesis
   in PFOA-treated cells decreased while the contribution of glutamine to
   fatty acid synthesis increased. Additionally, synthesis of TCA
   intermediates from fatty acid beta-oxidation was promoted in
   PFOA-treated cells. All results suggested that metabolic remodeling
   could happen in intestinal cells exposed to PFOA, which was potentially
   related to PFOA toxicity relevant with the loss of glucose in biomass
   synthesis and energy metabolism.},

Abstract = {Vertical transmission of metabolic constituents from mother to child
   contributes to the manifestation of disease phenotypes in early life.
   This study probes the vertical transmission of metabolites from mothers
   to offspring by utilizing machine learning techniques to differentiate
   between true mother-child dyads and randomly paired non-dyads. Employing
   random forests (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and
   logistic regression (Elasticnet) models, we analyzed metabolite
   concentration discrepancies in mother-child pairs, with maternal plasma
   sampled at 24 weeks of gestation and children's plasma at 6 months. The
   propensity of vertical transfer was quantified, reflecting the
   likelihood of accurate mother-child matching. Our findings were
   substantiated against an external test set and further verified through
   statistical tests, while the models were explained using permutation
   importance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The best model was
   achieved using RF, while xenobiotics were shown to be highly relevant in
   transfer. The study reaffirms the transmission of certain metabolites,
   such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), but also reveals additional
   insights into the maternal influence on the child's metabolome. We also
   discuss the multifaceted nature of vertical transfer. These machine
   learning-driven insights complement conventional epidemiological
   findings and offer a novel perspective on using machine learning as a
   methodology for understanding metabolic interactions.},

Abstract = {Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), such as pelvic organ prolapse (POP), anal
   incontinence (AI), and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs), affect
   approximately 1 in 4 women in the United States. Many women endure PFD
   symptoms without seeking care. The Andersen's health behavior model
   explains health service utilization (HSU) using 4 domains: (1)
   individual needs for care, (2) resources or enabling factors, (3)
   predisposing factors, and (4) macrostructural/contextual factors. This
   study aims to apply this model to PFDs to determine the rate of HSUs in
   American women experiencing PFDs. The secondary objective was to examine
   HSU behavior using a variation of Andersen's model: the authors limited
   outcome variables to that of accessing PFD health services by any health
   care provider. As the normal Andersen's health behavior model covers
   broad personal health practices and general health behavior, this
   modification allowed for increased precision of individual predictors
   and relevance to urogynecology.
   Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-analyses) guidelines, the authors conducted a systematic review of
   literature on PubMed, using search terms relevant to PFDs (in addition
   to disparities in care access). Included were studies of
   community-dwelling PFD symptomatic women living in the United States and
   quantitative and qualitative studies with primary and/or secondary aims
   addressing care-seeking or HSU behavior. For this study, PFDs were
   defined as AI, LUTSs, and POP. Extracted data were as follows: first
   author's last name, study aim, year of publication, study population
   geographic location, study participant demographics, PFD types,
   insurance, number of care-seekers and/or non-care-seekers, participant
   age, race/ethnicity, education, income, employment, body mass index,
   general health status, language used in study, symptoms, and other
   barriers and/or promotors identified.
   Overall, 44 publications were found that met the criteria of the study.
   Of these, 36 were quantitative, 5 were qualitative, and 3 were
   mixed-methods studies. The predominant focus of these studies was LUTSs
   (33/44 studies), whereas only 2 were on POP, 5 onmultiple PFDs, and 4
   onAI. More than half were publishedmore than a decade ago (25/44), and
   themajority were based on self-reporting to national surveys. Women with
   symptomatic PFDs exhibited a 37\% pooled prevalence of HSU, with
   determinants identified across the first 3 domains in the model only
   (macrostructural domains associated with HSU were not identified).
   For the first domain, quantitative studies demonstrated that PFD symptom
   severity and duration and preexisting depression were individual care
   needs associated with greater HSU behavior. Consistent with the
   quantitative data available in this study, qualitative data also
   demonstrated that facilitators of HSU were (1) longer symptom duration
   and (2) negative impact of PFD on quality of life.
   For the resources domain, established primary or secondary care and
   social support/networks increased HSU behaviors, but (oddly) higher
   income and employment were barriers to care. Of note, home remedy
   utilization was identified as a barrier to HSU in this category (taking
   of herbal supplements, use of diapers, and other self-management
   strategies).
   Predisposing factors noted to increase HSU in this study were age older
   than 50 years. Minority women were not well represented in this
   analysis, but notably, Asian women were significantly less likely to
   demonstrate HSU related to PFD. Qualitatively, there were no differences
   in socioeconomic status of women who did or did not show HSU, but the
   most common facilitator was awareness of PFD treatments, and common
   barriers included misinformation and normalization of pelvic floor
   symptoms.
   Limitations of this study include the possibility of missed publications
   with relevance (such as articles involving interstitial cystitis, sexual
   dysfunction, birth trauma, and others, as they are important aspects of
   PFDs). However, the team focused on studies related to common PFDs and
   their HSU, as opposed to peripheral analyses or pelvic floor conditions.
   Second, the study may be limited by using counts of themes and numbers
   of reporting studies in the overall qualitative analysis. Finally,
   significant heterogeneity in the studies indicates caution should be
   used in interpreting the operating room and pooled HSU rate for each
   identified determinant.
   The study indicates that designing inclusive interventions, building
   upon previous research frameworks, and addressing multilayered factors
   are all required for improving care-seeking rates of women with PFDs. To
   mitigate the glaring inequity in the United States of access to pelvic
   floor care, the authors recommend research focused on HSU for patients
   with POP or AI, implementation of multifaceted interventions, and
   investigations into macrostructural factors affecting HSU.},

Title = {Untargeted metabolomic analysis of pregnant women exposure to
   perfluorooctanoic acid at different degrees},

Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a novel type of persistent synthetic
   organic pollutant, and its exposure on pregnant women can cause some
   adverse effects, such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational
   diabetes mellitus, and preeclampsia. Therefore, understanding the
   metabolic changes caused by PFOA exposure is of great significance to
   protect pregnant women from its adverse effects. In this study, the
   metabolomes from the urine samples of pregnant women exposure to PFOA at
   different degrees were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. The samples in
   different groups were distinguished and the differential metabolites
   were screened based on the VIP value, FC, and P-value of each comparison
   group through multivariate statistical analysis. The pathways related to
   differential metabolites were searched to reveal the effects of PFOA
   exposure on metabolic changes in pregnant women at different degrees.
   Finally, the ROC of differential metabolites was performed, and the
   differential metabolites with large area under the curve (AUC) values
   were selected and compared to identify the mutually differential
   metabolites. Meanwhile, these metabolites were fitted with a
   multivariable to explore if they could be used to distinguish different
   groups. The quantitative comparison of mutually differential metabolites
   revealed that the levels of L-cysteine, glycine, and 5-aminovaleric acid
   were positively correlated with the degree of PFOA exposure, indicating
   that different degrees of PFOA exposure could affect the synthesis or
   degradation of GSH and change the metabolism of oral or intestinal
   microbiota. Additionally, they may cause oxidative stress and abnormal
   fat metabolism in pregnant women. (C) Higher Education Press 2023},

Abstract = {BackgroundInternal fixation with cephalomedullary nails has been widely
   used in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures (IFF). Yet,
   the difference in efficacy and safety between the commonly used
   integrated dual-screw cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) and single-screw
   cephalomedullary nail remains inconclusive. Thus we performed the
   present systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodsRandomized controlled
   trials (RCTs) or observational studies comparing InterTAN with proximal
   femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), the Asian PFNA (PFNA-II), or the
   Gamma3 nail in treating IFF were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of
   Science and Cochrane Library from inception to April 30, 2023. The
   differences in perioperative parameters and clinical and radiological
   outcomes were evaluated by mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence
   interval (95\%CI). The risks of various complications and mortality were
   assessed by risk ratio (RR) with 95\%CI.ResultsTwenty-three studies
   comprising 3566 patients were included. Compared with single-screw
   cephalomedullary nails (PFNA/PFNA-II, Gamma3), InterTAN conferred
   significantly reduced risk of implant failures (RR = 0.37, 95\%CI 0.26
   to 0.51, P < 0.001), hip and thigh pain (RR = 0.70, 95\%CI 0.55 to 0.90,
   P = 0.006) and all-cause revision/reoperation (RR = 0.38, 95\%CI 0.26 to
   0.57, P < 0.001). Moreover, patients treated with InterTAN had
   significantly higher 1-year Harris Hip Score (MD = 0.82, 95\%CI
   0.20-1.44, P = 0.010) and shorter time to union/healing (MD = - 0.66
   days, 95\%CI - 1.16 to - 0.16, P = 0.009). Femoral neck shortening, time
   to full bearing, and incidences of non-union, infection, deep venous
   thrombosis, and mortality were comparable between both
   groups.ConclusionsThe integrated dual-screw InterTAN construct has
   superior performance in reducing risks of complications and improving
   clinical and functional outcomes in the treatment of IFF. More
   well-designed, high-quality RCTs are warranted to confirm these
   findings.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have raised significant
   concerns within the realm of drinking water due to their widespread
   presence in various water sources. This prevalence poses potential risks
   to human health, ecosystems, and the safety of drinking water. However,
   there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews that systematically
   categorize the distribution characteristics and transformation
   mechanisms of PFASs in drinking water sources. This review aims to
   address this gap by concentrating on the specific sources of PFASs
   contamination in Chinese drinking water supplies. It seeks to elucidate
   the migration and transformation processes of PFASs within each source,
   summarize the distribution patterns of PFASs in surface and subsurface
   drinking water sources, and analyze how PFASs molecular structure,
   solubility, and sediment physicochemical parameters influence their
   presence in both the water phase and sediment. Furthermore, this review
   assesses two natural pathways for PFASs degradation, namely photolysis
   and biodegradation. It places particular emphasis on understanding the
   degradation mechanisms and the factors that affect the breakdown of
   PFASs by microorganisms. The ultimate goal is to provide valuable
   insights for the prevention and control of PFAS contamination and the
   assurance of drinking water quality.},

Title = {Plastic microfibers as a risk factor for the health of aquatic
   organisms: A bibliometric and systematic review of plastic pandemic},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {870},
Month = {APR 20},
Abstract = {Plastic microfibers (PMFs) are emerging pollutants widely distributed in
   the environment. In the early 2020s, the need for personal protection
   due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased consumption of plastic
   materials (e.g., facemasks and gloves) and ultimately to increased
   plastic pollution, especially by PMFs. The PMFs present in the
   environment may be released in this form (primary particles) or in
   larger materials, that will release them as a result of environmental
   conditions. Although a considerable number of studies have been
   addressing the effects of microplastics, most of them studied round
   particles, with fewer studies focusing on PMFs. Thus, the current study
   aimed to summarize and critically discuss the available data concerning
   the ecotoxicological impact of PMFs on aquatic organisms. Aquatic
   organisms exposed to PMFs showed accumulation, mainly in the digestive
   tract, and several toxic effects, such as DNA damage, physiological
   alterations, digestive damage and even mortality, suggesting that PMFs
   can pose a risk for the health of aquatic organisms. The PMFs induced
   toxicity to aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate organisms depends on
   size, shape, chemical association and composition of fibers. Regarding
   other size range (nm) of plastic fibers, the literature review
   highlighted a knowledge gap in terms of the effects of plastic
   nanofibers on aquatic organisms. There is a knowledge gap in terms of
   the interaction and modes of action of PMFs associated with other
   pollutants. In addition, studies addressing effects at different trophic
   levels as well as the use of other biological models should be
   considered. Overall, research gaps and recommendations for future
   research and trends considering the environmental impact of the COVID-19
   pandemic are presented.},

   Principles, Progress and Future Outlook},
Journal = {WATER},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {14},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {As the global population reaches eight billion, large quantities of
   wastewater (domestic, industrial, livestock) need to be treated in an
   efficient, green, and environmentally friendly manner. Wastewater
   hydroponics technology (HP) can efficiently remove various pollutants
   (conventional and emerging pollutants, heavy metals, and microorganisms)
   and create economic benefits. This paper aims to systematically review
   the principles, applications, and limitations of wastewater hydroponics
   technology in the context of pollution and nutrient removal. Unlike
   constructed wetlands, wastewater hydroponics has been proven to be
   effective in removing pollutants through small-scale in situ
   restoration. For instance, the average removal of COD, total nitrogen
   (TN), total phosphorus (TP), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) was more than
   70\%, 60\%, 80\%, 64.2\%, and 49.5\%, respectively. However, HP
   technology still has the disadvantages of high energy consumption,
   complex control parameters, and low public acceptance of using
   wastewater for planting crops. Therefore, further research is needed to
   reduce system energy consumption. In addition, hybrid technologies, such
   as two-stage hydroponics that use aquatic plants (algae or aquatic
   floating weeds) to recycle pollutant-containing wastewater nutrients for
   hydroponics, should be further developed.},

Abstract = {The increasing health risks posed by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFASs) in the environment highlight the importance of implementing
   effective removal techniques. Conventional wastewater treatment
   processes are inadequate for removing persistent organic pollutants.
   Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that metal-organic
   frameworks (MOFs) are capable of removing PFASs from water through
   adsorption techniques. However, there is still constructive discussion
   on the potential of MOFs in adsorbing and removing PFASs for large-scale
   engineering applications. This review systematically investigates the
   use of MOFs as adsorbents for the removal of PFAS in water treatment.
   This primarily involved a comprehensive analysis of existing literature
   to understand the adsorption mechanisms of MOFs and to identify factors
   that enhance their efficiency in removing PFASs. We also explore the
   critical aspects of regeneration and stability of MOFs, assessing their
   reusability and long-term performance, which are essential for
   large-scale water treatment applications. Finally, our study highlights
   the challenges of removing PFASs using MOFs. Especially, the efficient
   removal of short-chain PFASs with hydrophilicity is a major challenge,
   while medium- to long-chain PFASs are frequently susceptible to being
   captured from water by MOFs through multiple synergistic effects. The
   ion-exchange force may be the key to solving this difficulty, but its
   susceptibility to ion interference in water needs to be addressed in
   practical applications. We hope that this review can provide valuable
   insights into the effective removal and adsorption mechanisms of PFASs
   as well as advance the sustainable utilization of MOFs in the field of
   water treatment, thereby presenting a novel perspective.},

Abstract = {. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is an organochlorine insecticide
   used worldwide. Several studies have reported the toxic effects of DDT
   and its metabolites on steroid hormone biosynthesis; however, its
   environmental effects are not well understood. This study examined wild
   rats collected in DDT-sprayed areas of South Africa and quantified
   plasma metabolites using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight
   mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS). Fold change analysis of the metabolome
   revealed the effect of DDT on bile acid biosynthesis. Gene expression of
   the related enzyme in rat liver samples was also quantified. Significant
   association was found between DDT and gene expression levels related to
   constitutive androstane receptor mediated enzymes, such as Cyp2b1 in rat
   livers. However, our results could not fully demonstrate that enzymes
   related to bile acid biosynthesis were strongly affected by DDT. The
   correlation between DDT concentration and gene expression involved in
   steroid hormone synthesis in testis was also evaluated; however, no
   significant correlation was found. The disturbance of metabolic enzymes
   occurred in rat liver in the target area. Our results suggest that DDT
   exposure affects gene expression in wild rats living in DDT-sprayed
   areas. Therefore, there is a need for DDT toxicity evaluation in mammals
   living in DDT-sprayed areas. We could not find an effective biomarker
   that could reflect the mechanism of DDT exposure; however, this approach
   can provide new insights for future research to evaluate DDT effects in
   sprayed areas.},

Year = {2024},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Epidemiological and experimental research has indicated an association
   between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure and liver disease.
   However, the potential hepatotoxic effects and mechanisms of low-level
   prenatal PFOS exposure in offspring remain ambiguous. The objective of
   this research was to examine the alterations in liver transcriptomic and
   metabolomic profiles in offspring rats at postnatal day (PND) 30
   following gestational and lactational exposure to PFOS (from gestational
   day 1 to 20 and PND 1 to 21). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were
   separated into a control group (3\% starch gel solution, oral gavage)
   and a PFOS exposure group (0.03 mg/kg body weight per day, oral gavage).
   Histopathological changes in liver sections were observed by hematoxylin
   and eosin staining. Biochemical analysis was conducted to evaluate
   changes in glucose and lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic and metabolomic
   analyses were utilized to identify significant genes and metabolites
   associated with alterations of liver glucose and lipid metabolism
   through an integrated multi-omics analysis. No significant differences
   were found in the measured biochemical parameters. In total, 167
   significant differ-entially expressed genes (DEGs) related to processes
   such as steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and fat digestion
   and absorption were identified in offspring rats in the PFOS exposure
   group. Ninety-five altered metabolites were exhibited in the PFOS
   exposure group, such as heptaethylene glycol, lysoPE (0:0/18:0),
   lucidenic acid K, and p-Cresol sulfate. DEGs associated with steroid
   biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, fat digestion and absorption were
   significantly upregulated in the PFOS exposure group (P < 0.05). The
   analysis of correlations indicated that there was a significant inverse
   correlation between all identified differential metabolites and the
   levels of fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein, and
   triglycerides in the PFOS exposure group (P < 0.05). Our findings
   demystify that early-life PFOS exposure can lead to alterations in
   transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in the offspring's liver, which
   provided mechanistic insights into the potential hepatotoxicity and
   developmental toxicity associated with environmentally relevant levels
   of PFOS exposure.},

Title = {Epidemiology Evidence for Health Effects of 150 per- and Polyfluoroalkyl
   Substances: A Systematic Evidence Map},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH PERSPECTIVES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {130},

Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND: Per- and polylluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a large
   class of chemicals with widespread use and persistence in the
   environment and in humans; however, most of the epidemiology research
   has focused on a small subset.
   OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to
   summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied
   PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating
   interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities
   for risk assessment and data gaps for future research.
   METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO)
   criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health
   effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the
   identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for
   literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual
   review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data
   extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the
   Integrated Risk Information System approach.
   RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included
   information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied
   health effect categories were metabolic (n =37), endocrine (n =30),
   cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n=27), developmental (n = 26),
   immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n=14), cancer
   (n=12), and urinary (n =11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62\%)
   studies were considered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome.
   DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology
   data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects.
   Although exposure to the 15 PEAS that had data was fairly low in most
   studies, these less-studied PEAS may be used as replacements for
   ``legacy{''} PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is
   impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps
   for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SENT highlights some of the
   important research gaps that currently exist.},

Abstract = {Objective: This systematic review investigated whether people with
   patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) have muscle strength, volume, and
   activation around the hip and knee that is different from asymptomatic
   controls.
   Methods: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with
   terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation.
   Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one
   asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the
   studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of
   evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random
   effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least
   two studies reporting the same domain.
   Results: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria.
   Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95\%CI = -1.34
   to -0.57), hip external rotation (-0.55;-1.07 to -0.03), hip extension
   (-0.72;-1.16 to -0.28), and knee extension (-0.97;-1.41 to -0.53) when
   compared to asymptomatic controls. People with PFOA also presented with
   smaller volumes of the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, tensor fascia
   lata, vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris
   when compared to asymptomatic controls. Also, people with PFOA presented
   with changes in muscle activation for the VL, VM and gluteus maximus
   (GMax) when compared to asymptomatic controls.
   Conclusion: People with PFOA present with lower strength and volume of
   the hip and quadriceps muscles and altered muscle activation of the VM,
   VL and GMax during ascending and descending stairs when compared to
   asymptomatic controls. However, the certainty of these findings are very
   low. (C) 2022 Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of Osteoarthritis

Title = {Transcriptome and Metabolome Analyses Reveal Perfluorooctanoic
   Acid-Induced Kidney Injury by Interfering with PPAR Signaling Pathway},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR SCIENCES},

Abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is widely used in aviation science and
   technology, transportation, electronics, kitchenware, and other
   household products. It is stable in the environment and has potential
   nephrotoxicity. To investigate the effect of PFOA exposure during
   pregnancy on the kidneys of offspring mice, a total of 20 mice at day 0
   of gestation were randomly divided into two groups (10 mice in each
   group), and each group was administered 0.2 mL of PFOA at a dose of 3.5
   mg/kg or deionized water by gavage during gestation. The kidney weight,
   kidney index, histopathological observation, serum biochemistry,
   transcriptomics, and metabolomics of the kidneys of the 35-day offspring
   mice were analyzed. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide
   dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) levels in the kidney were measured.
   Transcriptome analysis results showed that 387 genes were up-regulated
   and 283 genes were down-regulated compared with the control group. These
   differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly concentrated in the
   peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway and
   circadian rhythm. Compared with the control group, 64 and 73 metabolites
   were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the PFOA group. The
   altered metabolites were mainly enriched in the biosynthesis of
   unsaturated fatty acids. PFOA can affect the expression levels of
   circadian rhythm-related genes in the kidneys of offspring mice, and
   this change is influenced by the PPAR signaling pathway. PFOA causes
   oxidative stress in the kidneys, which is responsible for significant
   changes in metabolites associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated
   fatty acids.},

Title = {Does the Contractile Capability of Pelvic Floor Muscles Improve with
   Knowledge Acquisition and Verbal Instructions in Healthy Women? A
   Systematic Review},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},

Abstract = {Seventy percent of women with pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) are
   estimated to present deficient consciousness of their pelvic floor
   muscles (PFMs) and poor ability to contract them. Improving the
   proprioception of PFMs, defined as the capacity to know the status and
   position of each body part, and adequately contracting them could be a
   protective factor to prevent the appearance of PFDs in the general
   female population. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of
   educational interventions and verbal instructions on how to contract and
   exercise the PFMs to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women. A
   systematic search of studies published in the last 20 years until March
   2022 was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science,
   Scopus, PEDro, Lilacs, and Dialnet databases. A meta-analysis could not
   be performed due to the heterogeneity in the types of studies and
   included populations. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for the
   design, search, and reporting of studies. The methodological quality was
   analysed via the PEDro and the Newcastle-Ottawa scales in the case of
   randomised clinical trials and non-randomised studies, respectively,
   while the quality of evidence was determined using the SIGN grading
   system for evidence-based guidelines. Descriptive and experimental
   studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that evaluated the
   contractile capability of the PFMs in healthy women or women without a
   previous diagnosis of PFD were included. Seven articles that included a
   total of 2507 women were found, three of which were clinical trials with
   PEDro scores between 5 and 9 points out of 10 and four of which were
   non-randomised studies with NOS scores between 6 and 8 points out of 10.
   The outcomes were measured through vaginal palpation, visual
   observation, questionnaires for PFD symptoms, and self-perception
   reports. This review discriminated between two types of intervention,
   educational programmes and verbal instructions, and evaluated the
   changes observed in PFM strength and knowledgeability and the symptoms
   of PFDs. The findings showed that educational interventions and verbal
   instructions improve the proprioception of PFMs in women of all ages
   that are healthy or without a previous diagnosis of PFDs as well as
   their knowledge about the pelvic floor, healthy lifestyle habits, and
   symptoms that are potentially indicative of PFDs. Further high-quality
   randomised clinical trials are warranted to draw definitive conclusions
   about the effectiveness of educational interventions to improve the
   proprioception of the PFMs in women considered healthy or with mild
   symptoms that may be indicative of PFDs.},

   versus dynamic hip screw for unstable intertrochanteric femoral
   fractures: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {102},
Number = {6},
Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Background:The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the advantages
   and disadvantages of proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) versus
   dynamic hip screw (DHS) for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric
   fractures, including the available evidence drawn from the literature.
   Methods:A systematic search was conducted to identify available and
   relevant randomized controlled trials and retrospective comparative
   observational studies regarding PFNA compared against DHS in treating
   unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures in Embase, PubMed, Cochrane
   Library, Web of Science, and Scopus Online up to February 12, 2022. Data
   from the included studies were extracted independently by 2 reviewers
   and analyzed using RevMan 5.3, and the quality of the studies was
   assessed. Results:Five randomized controlled trials and 12 observational
   studies were recruited and met the inclusion criteria, which consisted
   of 1332 patients with PFNA and 1271 patients with DHS. The results of
   the meta-analysis showed that, compared with the DHS, PFNA exhibited a
   beneficial role in postoperative Harris Hip Scores, operation time,
   intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, fracture healing
   time and full weight-bearing time, limb shortening, cutout, reoperation,
   union problems, the varus collapse of the femoral head/neck, and
   infection; however, DHS was superior to PFNA in hidden blood loss
   (relative risk {[}RR] = 139.81, 95\% confidence interval {[}CI]
   {[}136.18, 143.43], P < .00001), postoperation drainage (RR = -17.85,
   95\% CI {[}-30.10, -5.60], P = .004), total blood loss (RR = 50.34, 95\%
   CI {[}42.99, 57.69], P < .00001), and femoral shaft fracture (RR = 4.72,
   95\% CI {[}1.15, 19.32], P = .03) treated by DHS were significantly
   decreased, compared with those by PFNA; however, no significant
   differences were observed in tip-apex distance, fixation failures, screw
   migration, or other complicants between the 2 surgical methods.
   Conclusion:Analysis of a large number of relevant clinical indicators
   available shows that PFNA has better clinical manifestation than DHS in
   treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures.},

   childhood BMI trajectories: A mediation analysis with neonatal metabolic
   profiles},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {867},

Abstract = {Background: In utero perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure has been
   associated with childhood adiposity, but the mechanisms are poorly
   known.Objective: To investigate the potential mediating role of neonatal
   metabolites in the relationship between prenatal PFAS exposure and
   childhood adiposity trajectories in the first four years of
   life.Methods: We analyzed the data for 1671 mother-child pairs from the
   Shanghai Birth Cohort study. We included those with PFAS exposure
   information in early pregnancy, neonatal metabolites data and at least
   three child anthropometric measurements at 6,12, 24 and/or 48 months.
   Body mass index (BMI) z-score trajectories were identified using latent
   class growth mixture modeling. The associations between PFAS
   concentrations and trajectory classes were assessed using multinomial
   logistic regression. Screening and penalization-based selection was used
   to identify neonatal amino acids and acylcarnitines with significant
   mediation effects.Results: Three BMI z-score trajectories in early
   childhood were identified: a persistent increase trajectory (Class 1,
   2.2 \%), a stable trajectory (Class 2, 66 \%), and a transient increase
   trajectory (Class 3, 32 \%). Increased odds of being in Class 1 were
   observed in association with one log-unit increase in concentrations of
   perfluorooctane sulfonate (odds ratio {[}OR], 1.76 {[}95 \% CI,
   0.96-3.23], Class 2 as reference;OR, 2.36 {[}95 \% CI, 1.27-4.40], Class
   3 as reference), perfluorononanoic acid (OR, 1.90 {[}95 \% CI,
   0.97-3.72], Class 2 as reference; OR, 2.23 {[}95 \% CI, 1.12-4.42],
   Class 3 as reference) and perfluorodecanoic acid (OR, 1.95 {[}95 \% CI,
   1.12-3.38], Class 2 as reference; OR, 2.14 {[}95 \% CI, 1.22-3.76],
   Class 3 as reference). The effect of prenatal PFAS exposure on being in
   Class 1 was significantly but partly mediated by octanoylcarnitine (2.64
   \% for perfluorononanoic acid and 3.70 \% for sum of 10
   PFAS).Conclusions: In utero PFAS exposure is a risk factor for
   persistent growth in BMI z-score in early childhood. The alter-ation of
   neonatal acylcarnitines suggests a potential molecular pathway.},

Title = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) mixtures induce gut microbiota
   dysbiosis and metabolic disruption in silkworm (Bombyx mori L.)},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {914},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Mixed legacy and emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs)
   are commonly found in soil and dust; however, the potential toxicity of
   PFAS mixtures (mPFASs) in insects is unknown. Using 16S rRNA gene
   sequencing and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), we evaluated the
   adverse effects of mPFASs on silkworms, a typical lepidopteran insect.
   After exposure to mPFASs, the silkworm midgut was enriched with high
   levels of PFASs, which induced histopathological changes. The
   composition of the midgut microbiota was significantly affected by mPFAS
   exposure, and functional predictions revealed significant disruption of
   some metabolic pathways. RNA-seq analysis revealed that mPFASs
   significantly changed the transcription profiles. Functional enrichment
   analysis of the differentially expressed genes also revealed that
   biological processes related to metabolic pathways and the digestive
   system were significantly affected, similar to the results of the gut
   microbiota analysis, suggesting that mPFAS exposure had an adverse
   effect on the metabolic function of silkworms and may further affect
   their normal growth. Finally, the significant correlation between
   abundance changes in the gut microbiota and metabolism/digestion-related
   genes further highlighted the role of the gut microbiota in
   mPFAS-related processes affecting the metabolic functions of silkworms.
   To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the toxic effects
   of mPFASs in insects and provide basic data for further PFAS toxicity
   investigations in insects and comprehensive ecological risk assessments
   of mPFASs.},

Title = {A Multi-Level Systems Biology Analysis of Aldrin's Metabolic Effects on
   Prostate Cancer Cells},
Journal = {PROTEOMES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {2},
Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {Although numerous studies support a dose-effect relationship between
   Endocrine disruptors (EDs) and the progression and malignancy of tumors,
   the impact of a chronic exposure to non-lethal concentrations of EDs in
   cancer remains unknown. More specifically, a number of studies have
   reported the impact of Aldrin on a variety of cancer types, including
   prostate cancer. In previous studies, we demonstrated the induction of
   the malignant phenotype in DU145 prostate cancer (PCa) cells after a
   chronic exposure to Aldrin (an ED). Proteins are pivotal in the
   regulation and control of a variety of cellular processes. However, the
   mechanisms responsible for the impact of ED on PCa and the role of
   proteins in this process are not yet well understood. Here, two
   complementary computational approaches have been employed to investigate
   the molecular processes underlying the acquisition of malignancy in
   prostate cancer. First, the metabolic reprogramming associated with the
   chronic exposure to Aldrin in DU145 cells was studied by integrating
   transcriptomics and metabolomics via constraint-based metabolic
   modeling. Second, gene set enrichment analysis was applied to determine
   (i) altered regulatory pathways and (ii) the correlation between changes
   in the transcriptomic profile of Aldrin-exposed cells and tumor
   progression in various types of cancer. Experimental validation
   confirmed predictions revealing a disruption in metabolic and regulatory
   pathways. This alteration results in the modification of protein levels
   crucial in regulating triacylglyceride/cholesterol, linked to the
   malignant phenotype observed in Aldrin-exposed cells.},

Abstract = {Background: Antibiotic resistance has become a significant problem due
   to its impact such as higher medical costs, prolonged hospital stays,
   and increased mortality. The Internal Medicine Ward has a high
   consumption of antibiotics, particularly for gastroenteritis, typhoid,

   applied in hospitals may provide valid data to evaluate antimicrobial
   usage as a global standard method. Objective: To explore the antibiotic
   use pattern in the internal medicine department based on the DDD/ATC
   system. Method: The authors explored articles from the database in PMC,
   Research Gate, and Google Scholar from July 11st, 2020, to July 21st,
   2020. The authors included original articles/research, case reports, and
   meta-analyses from 2006 to 2020, which discussed DDD/100 patient-days or
   DDD/100 bed-days antibiotics in the internal medicine ward. A major
   criterion was to ensure all subjects in publications were adults aged
   above 18. Result: Penicillin is the most consumed (127.9 DDD/100 bed-
   days), followed by Cephalosporin (41.42 DDD/100-bed-days) and
   Fluoroquinolone (25.87 DDD/100 bed-days). Conclusion: The most

Abstract = {In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively analyse
   the effectiveness of using proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA)
   and dynamic hip screws (DHS) to treat intertrochanteric fractures on
   postoperative surgical site infections (SSI). PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane
   Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang
   databases were searched from their inception until December 2022 to
   identify studies that compared PFNA and DHS in the treatment of
   intertrochanteric fractures. Two investigators independently screened
   the retrieved studies to assess their quality and verify their
   eligibility for inclusion. Meta-analyses were performed with RevMan 5.4
   software. Thirty studies, including 3158 patients, met the inclusion
   criteria. These studies included 1574 patients treated with PFNA, and
   1584 were treated with DHS. The findings of the meta-analysis revealed a
   significant reduction in the incidence of SSI in patients treated with
   PFNA compared with those treated with DHS (2.64\% vs 6.76\%, odds ratio
   {[}OR]: 0.40, 95\% confidence intervals {[}CIs]: 0.28-0.57, P < .001),
   superficial SSI (2.58\% vs 5.01\%, OR: 0.53, 95\% CIs: 0.33-0.85, P =
   .008) and deep SSI (1.26\% vs 3.43\%, OR: 0.41, 95\% CIs: 0.19-0.92, P =
   .03). PFNA was more effective than DHS in reducing the incidence of SSI.
   Even so, significant variations in sample sizes among the included
   studies meant that the methodology for some studies had qualitative
   deficiencies. Therefore, additional studies with large sample sizes are
   needed to validate these results.},

Abstract = {Introduction Autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) are
   believed to be caused by the interplay between several genetic and
   environmental factors. Elucidation of the role of environmental factors
   in metabolic and immune dysfunction leading to autoimmune disease is not
   yet well characterized. Objectives Here we investigated the impact of
   exposure to a mixture of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on the
   metabolome in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an experimental model of
   T1D. The mixture contained organochlorides, organobromides, and per- and
   polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Methods Analysis of molecular lipids
   (lipidomics) and bile acids in serum samples was performed by
   UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, while polar metabolites were analyzed by GC-Q-TOF/MS.
   Results Experimental exposure to the POP mixture in these mice led to
   several metabolic changes, which were similar to those previously
   reported as associated with PFAS exposure, as well as risk of T1D in
   human studies. This included an increase in the levels of sugar
   derivatives, triacylglycerols and lithocholic acid, and a decrease in
   long chain fatty acids and several lipid classes, including
   phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins.
   Conclusion Taken together, our study demonstrates that exposure to POPs
   results in an altered metabolic signature previously associated with
   autoimmunity.},

Title = {Impaired Detoxification of Trans, Trans-2,4-Decadienal, an Oxidation
   Product from Omega-6 Fatty Acids, Alters Insulin Signaling,
   Gluconeogenesis and Promotes Microvascular Disease},

Abstract = {Omega-6 fatty acids are the primary polyunsaturated fatty acids in most
   Western diets, while their role in diabetes remains controversial.
   Exposure of omega-6 fatty acids to an oxidative environment results in
   the generation of a highly reactive carbonyl species known as trans,
   trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). The timely and efficient detoxification
   of this metabolite, which has actions comparable to other reactive
   carbonyl species, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and
   methylglyoxal, is essential for disease prevention. However, the
   detoxification mechanism for tt-DDE remains elusive. In this study, the
   enzyme Aldh9a1b is identified as having a key role in the detoxification
   of tt-DDE. Loss of Aldh9a1b increased tt-DDE levels and resulted in an
   abnormal retinal vasculature and glucose intolerance in aldh9a1b-/-
   zebrafish. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that tt-DDE
   and aldh9a1b deficiency in larval and adult zebrafish induced insulin
   resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis. Moreover, alterations in
   hyaloid vasculature is induced by aldh9a1b knockout or by tt-DDE
   treatment can be rescued by the insulin receptor sensitizers metformin
   and rosiglitazone. Collectively, these results demonstrated that tt-DDE
   is the substrate of Aldh9a1b which causes microvascular damage and
   impaired glucose metabolism through insulin resistance.
   Omega-6 fatty acids, prevalent in Western diets, are oxidized to form
   trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). This study reveals ALDH9a1b as a
   novel detoxifying system for tt-DDE, confirmed by a CRISPR KO line.
   Analysis of transcriptome, metabolomics, and molecular experiments shows
   that aldh9a1b mutation not only alters tt-DDE metabolism but induces
   diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, offering new insights into the
   omega-6-diabetes link.image},

Abstract = {Fast track surgery (FTS) is widely used in many procedures and has been
   shown to reduce complications and accelerate recovery. However, no
   studies have been conducted to assess their effectiveness in treating
   wounds after radical prostatectomy (RP). The objective of this study was
   to evaluate the impact of FTS on RP. We went through 4 major databases.
   A study was conducted by PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and the
   Web of Science to determine the effect of comparison of FTS versus
   conventional surgery in RP on postoperative wound complications as of 1
   July 2023. Based on the review of literature, data extraction and
   literature quality assessment, we conducted meta-analyses with RevMan
   5.3. In the course of the study, the researchers selected 6 of the 404
   studies to be analysed according to exclusion criteria. Data analysis
   showed that the FTS method reduced the postoperative pain associated
   with VAS and also decreased the rate of postoperative complications in
   post-surgical patients. However, there was no significant difference
   between FTS and conventional surgery in terms of blood loss, operation
   time, and postoperative infection rate. Therefore, generally speaking,
   FTS has less impact on postoperative complications in patients with
   minimal invasive prostatic cancer, but it does reduce postoperative pain
   and total postoperative complications.},

Abstract = {Polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) can be found throughout society
   due to their numerous commercial applications. However, they also pose
   an environmental and health concern given their ability to undergo
   hydrolysis and oxidation to several bioactive and persistent products,
   including the perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The metabolism of PAPs
   has been shown to occur in mammalian liver and intestine, however
   metabolism by the gut microbiome has not yet been investigated. In this
   study, human fecal samples were used to model the microbial population
   of the colon, to test whether these anaerobic microbes could facilitate
   8:2 monosubstituted PAP (monoPAP) transformation. In vitro testing was
   completed by incubating the fecal samples with 8:2 monoPAP (400-10,000
   nM) up to 120 minutes in an anaerobic chamber. Reactions were then
   terminated and the samples prepared for GC- and LC-MS/MS analysis.
   Metabolites of interest were the immediate hydrolysis product, the 8:2
   fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), and 11 additional metabolites previously
   shown to form from 8:2 FTOH in both oxic and anoxic environments. The
   kinetics of 8:2 monoPAP transformation by gut microbiota were compared
   to those in human S9 liver and intestine fractions, both of which have
   active levels of hydrolyzing and oxidative enzymes that transform 8:2
   monoPAP. Transformation rates from 8:2 monoPAP to 8:2 FTOH were highest
   in liver S9 > intestine S9 > fecal suspensions. The gut microbiome also
   produced a unique composition of oxidative metabolites, where the
   following intermediate metabolites were more abundant than terminal
   PFCAs: 8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA) > 8:2
   fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA) > 7:2 Ketone approximate to
   perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Hydrolytic and oxidative metabolites
   contributed up to 30\% of the molar balance after microbial 8:2 monoPAP
   transformation. Together, the results suggest that the gut microbiome
   can play a notable role in PAP biotransformation.},

   patients who underwent FTS using PICOTS and PRISMA Statements. Outcomes
   reviewed included age; gender; indications; pathology; functional
   evaluations; surgical outcomes and complications.Results Fifteen papers
   met our inclusion criteria, accounting for 394 patients. Endoscopic or
   robotic FTS was carried out for benign and malignant thyroid lesions,
   with or without central neck dissection. Nodule size and thyroid lobe
   volume did not exceed 6, 10 cm, respectively. FTS reported comparable
   outcome with transaxillary or oral approaches about operative time,
   complication rates or drainage features. The mean operative time ranged
   from 88 to 220 min, depending on the type of surgery (endoscopic vs
   robotic hemi- or total thyroidectomy). Conversion to open surgery was
   rare, occurring in 0-6.3\% of cases. The most common complications were
   earlobe hypoesthesia, hematoma, seroma, transient hypocalcemia and
   transient recurrent nerve palsy. There was an important disparity
   between studies about the inclusion/exclusion criteria, surgical and
   functional outcomes.Conclusion FTS is a safe and effective approach for
   thyroid benign and malignant lesions. FTS reports similar complications

Title = {Association between sick sinus syndrome and atrial fibrillation: A
   systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF CARDIOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {381},
Pages = {20-36},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {Aims: Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently
   coexist and show a bidirectional relationship. This systematic review
   and meta-analysis aimed to decipher the precise relationship between SSS
   and AF, further exploring and comparing different therapy strategies on
   the occurrence or progression of AF in patients with SSS.
   Methods and results: A systematic literature search was conducted until
   November 2022. A total of 35 articles with 37,550 patients were
   included. Patients with SSS were associated with new-onset AF compared
   to those without SSS. Catheter ablation was associated with a lower risk
   of AF recurrence, AF progression, all-cause mortality, stroke and
   hospitalization of heart failure compared to pacemaker therapy.
   Regarding the different pacing strategies for SSS, VVI/VVIR has higher
   risk of new-onset AF than DDD/DDDR. No significant difference was found
   between AAI/AAIR and DDD/DDDR, as well as between DDD/DDDR and minimal
   ventricular pacing (MVP) for AF recurrence. AAI/AAIR was associated with
   higher risk of all-cause mortality when compared to DDD/DDDR, but lower
   risk of cardiac death when compared to DDD/DDDR. Right atrial septum
   pacing was associated with a similar risk of new-onset AF or AF
   recurrence compared to right atrial appendage pacing.
   Conclusion: SSS is associated with a higher risk of AF. For patients
   with both SSS and AF, catheter ablation should be considered. This
   meta-analysis re-emphasizes that high percentage of ventricular pacing
   should be avoided in patients with SSS in order to decrease AF burden
   and mortality.},

Title = {Assessing the risk of lumbar degenerative disc disease associated with

Journal = {PM\&R},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 19},
Abstract = {ObjectiveThe purpose of the current study is to synthesize the outcomes
   of investigations reporting the odds of lumbar degenerative disc disease
   (DDD) in competitive swimmers compared to controls.Literature
   SurveyPubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched
   according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and
   Meta-Analyses guidelines from inception until March 2023 to identify
   relevant studies evaluating the risk for lumbar DDD associated with
   swimming.MethodsData in the current literature were synthesized for
   positive imaging findings of DDD at one or more lumbar level in swimmers
   compared to nonswimmers. Additionally, data regarding prevalence of
   lumbar disc degeneration and back pain in competitive swimmers were
   synthesized.SynthesisFour studies were included in the final analysis.
   Study quality and risk of bias were deemed adequate. There was
   significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 0.74) regarding data
   collected, population of swimmers, sample size, and methods. Therefore,
   a meta-analysis was not conducted. The majority of the studies included
   in this study (three of four) reported that swimmers have increased odds
   of developing lumbar DDD. Additionally, secondary outcome analysis
   indicated that swimmers have a higher probability of developing
   moderate-to-severe back pain.ConclusionCompetitive swimming appears to
   be associated with the presence of DDD on advanced imaging and
   moderate-to-severe back pain. These findings are limited by significant
   differences in study methodology in the included studies. Although
   swimming is conventionally considered a low-impact sport, elite swimmers
   risk developing lower back pain and disc pathology, possibly because
   training involves unique biomechanics with repetitive rotational and
   hyperextension/flexion of the spine. Further research investigating risk
   factors involving biomechanics of swimming on the spine may have
   important implications for stroke technique, injury prevention, and
   rehabilitation for swimmers.},

Abstract = {Acquired platelet function disorders (PFD) are rare bleeding diseases
   that should be suspected in all patients with unexplained mucocutaneous
   bleedings of recent onset, with no previous history of haemorrhages, and
   with normal coagulation test and platelet count. Drug-induced platelet
   function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be
   identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting
   drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those
   caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of
   autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most
   non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired
   Glanzmann thrornbasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that
   bind to platelet alpha llb beta 3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is
   the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological
   malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More
   rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta
   storage pool disease (a delta SPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the
   control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatrnent of the under lying
   disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for
   autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon
   treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary
   aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on
   immunosuppressive therapies.
   Here we present a systematic review of previously described
   immune-mediated aGT and a delta SPD cases. Clinical and laboratory
   characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the
   eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also
   discussed. Although no guidelines are available for the management of
   these very rare conditions, presentation of all cases reported so far
   can help clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of these
   life-threatening diseases.},

Year = {2024},
Volume = {16},

Abstract = {Species feeding lower at the food web like cyprinids (carp) are often
   advocated for sustainable aquaculture. However, their gastrointestinal
   biology (lack of stomach) has limited their acid-peptic digestion, acid
   lysis of plants and invertebrate tissues, and phosphorus uptake. This
   review presents data from 118 articles on the use of plant-based feed
   additives (PFAs) in Cyprinus carpio (common carp). Our review shows that
   most PFA research in carp is focused on improving feed and nutrient
   utilization efficiency along various levels (in vivo digestibility,
   metabolizability to in situ nutrient loading), while other half is
   focused on ensuring animal welfare standards (biomass, immunity,
   welfare). Several reviewed plant-based additives however tend to do
   both. The PFAs include essential oils (EOs), plant-part extracts (PPEs),
   medicinal plants (herbs) and spices. The effective inclusion rate of EOs
   is lower (0.5\%-0.75\%). Whereas PPEs, herbs and spices work at a
   generic inclusion rate of 2\%-5\% in carp feeds. Even at an optimum
   inclusion rate, there are factors controlling PFAs efficacy such as
   methods of preparation (reviewed). PFAs like lemon beebrush, geranium,
   dill, Rosemary pepper and common mallow with/without certain
   pre-conditions are better to avoid in cyprinid diets. Although certain
   PFAs may potentially alter organoleptic qualities of carp flesh or might
   assist in training carp immunity, information on these aspects is
   limited. The review also provides a quick guide to researchers and feed
   companies interested in exploring the potential of PFAs in C. carpio
   aquaculture. Potential PFAs that could be valuable for cyprinids, but
   not yet explored are also listed.},

Abstract = {BackgroundThis study aimed to systematically analyze the relationship
   between preterm (PT), low birth weight (LBW), and developmental defects
   of enamel (DDE) in the primary dentition. MethodsFollowing the retrieval
   of the databases, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and
   cohort studies on the relationship between PT, LBW and DDE, which had
   been published in English or Chinese up to January 2022 were included.
   The data about odds ratio (OR) and 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI)
   were extracted and calculated using STATA 12.0 Software. Case-control
   studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), while
   cross-sectional studies and cohort studies were evaluated using the JBI
   scale. The heterogeneity of each study was evaluated using the Q test.
   ResultsA total of 15 studies were included, of which 8 studied the
   relationship between PT and DDE, and 13 explored the relationship
   between LBW and DDE including three about the relationship between very
   low birth weight (VLBW) and DDE. Seven studies explored the relationship
   between PT, LBW, and DDE. The results of this meta-analysis showed that
   both PT and LBW especially VLBW (OR = 7.19, 95\% CI: 4.98-10.38) were
   risk factors for DDE in the primary dentition (OR = 2.33, 95\% CI:
   1.55-3.51) (OR = 1.67, 95\% CI: 1.08-2.59). The subgroup results showed
   that PT and LBW were both associated with the occurrence of enamel
   hypoplasia (EHP) (OR = 6.89, 95\% CI: 3.33-14.34; OR = 2.78, 95\% CI:
   2.10-3.68) rather than enamel opacity (OR = 0.94, 95\% CI: 0.55-1.61; OR
   = 1.03, 95\% CI: 0.66-1.61). There was no publication bias about the
   included studies (P = 0.75 > 0.05; P = 0.47 > 0.05). ConclusionThis
   meta-analysis demonstrated that both PT and LBW especially VLBW are
   associated with a higher risk of DDE in the primary dentition. PT and
   LBW are both related to the occurrence of EHP. However, the relationship
   between PT, LBW, and enamel opacity has not been verified. Systematic

Title = {The association of environmental organochlorine pesticides exposure and
   human semen parameters: a systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH-HEIDELBERG},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 27},
Abstract = {Aim Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) accumulate in human tissues and
   interfere with human endocrine function. However, the effect of OCPs on
   sperm quality remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to
   analyze the relationship between environmental OCPs exposure and human
   semen parameters.Subject and methods A comprehensive search of articles
   before March 6, 2023, was conducted through PubMed, Web of Science, and
   Embase databases. The literature's quality was evaluated using a
   modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). STATA (Version 11.0) was used for
   meta-analysis, and relevant data were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and
   95\% confidence interval (CI).Results Ten articles were analyzed in this
   meta-analysis, including six cross-sectional studies, three cohort
   studies, and one case-control study. These studies involved 5232 people
   in 10 countries. The results showed that there was an association
   between OCPs exposure and decreased human semen parameters (OR = 1.47,
   95\%CI = 1.40-1.56), including decreased sperm volume (OR = 1.79, 95\%CI
   = 1.15-2.79), decreased sperm count (OR = 1.31, 95\%CI = 1.19-1.44),
   decreased sperm concentration (OR = 1.34, 95\%CI = 1.10-1.63), impaired
   sperm motility (OR = 1.87, 95\%CI = 1.16-3.01), and sperm morphology (OR
   = 1.42, 95\%CI = 1.02-1.99), respectively. Additionally, in sub-group
   analysis according to the type of OCPs, there was no association between
   DDE exposure and decreased semen parameters (OR = 1.01, 95\%CI =
   0.99-1.03). In sub-group analysis according to the location, the results
   indicated a positive association between OCPs and sperm morphology (OR =
   2.22, 95\%CI = 1.40-3.54) in North America. Moreover, in Europe, the
   results indicated a positive association between OCPs and decreased
   semen parameters (OR = 1.45, 95\%CI = 1.34-1.56), including decreased
   sperm volume (OR = 1.65, 95\%CI = 1.06-2.58), decreased sperm count (OR
   = 1.71, 95\%CI = 1.10-2.65), decreased sperm concentration (OR = 1.35,
   95\%CI = 1.04-1.74), and impaired sperm motility (OR=1.85, 95\%CI =
   1.11-3.08), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the combined
   OR had good stability and high reliability. Funnel plots and Egger's
   test showed a large publication bias in this study.Conclusions The
   findings suggested that OCPs exposure may be a risk factor for a decline
   in semen parameters. Further actions are needed to protect male
   fertility in the future.},

Abstract = {Resilience is a multidisciplinary concept that deals with rapid response
   and recovery of a system experiencing a disruption. Despite extensive
   research on this topic, there is a need to clarify resilience concepts
   in the context of road freight transportation systems (FTSs) from a
   three-dimensional perspective (i.e., physical infrastructure, users, and
   managing organizations) and to identify persistent knowledge gaps
   concerning the characterization and measurement of FTS resilience
   vis-a-vis disruptive events. This paper addresses these shortcomings
   through a systematic review of 149 research studies. The synthesis of
   findings clarifies inconsistencies associated with the characteristics
   of FTS resilience and in so doing, establishes a unified framework for
   measuring FTS resilience through the life cycle of disruptive events.
   Critical data gaps, methodological shortcomings, and a lack of empirical
   evidence concerning FTS resilience to disruptive events remain. More
   robust analytical approaches are required to incorporate
   interdependencies among FTS dimensions into resilience assessments.},

Title = {Microbiological and chemical drinking water contaminants and associated

   meta-analysis},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {In rural areas of the United States, an estimated similar to 1.8 million
   people lack reliable access to safe drinking water. Considering the
   relative dearth of information on water contamination and health
   outcomes in Appalachia, we conducted a systematic review of studies of
   microbiological and chemical drinking water contamination and associated
   health outcomes in rural Appalachia. We pre-registered our protocols,
   limiting eligibility to primary data studies published from 2000 to
   2019, and searched four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and
   the Cochrane Library). We used qualitative syntheses, meta-analyses,
   risk of bias analysis, and meta-regression to assess reported findings,
   with reference to US EPA drinking water standards. Of the 3452 records
   identified for screening, 85 met our eligibility criteria. 93 \% of
   eligible studies (n = 79) used cross-sectional designs. Most studies
   were conducted in Northern (32 \%, n = 27) and North Central (24 \%, n =
   20) Appalachia, and only 6 \% (n = 5) were conducted exclusively in
   Central Appalachia. Across studies, E. coli were detected in 10.6 \% of
   samples (sample-size-weighted mean percentage from 4671 samples, 14
   publications). Among chemical contaminants, sample-size-weighted mean
   concentrations for arsenic were 0.010 mg/L (n = 21,262 samples, 6
   publications), and 0.009 mg/L for lead (n = 23,259, 5 publications). 32
   \% (n = 27) of studies assessed health outcomes, but only 4.7 \% (n = 4)
   used case-control or cohort designs (all others were cross-sectional).
   The most commonly reported outcomes were detection of PFAS in blood
   serum (n = 13), gastrointestinal illness (n = 5), and
   cardiovascularrelated outcomes (n = 4). Of the 27 studies that assessed
   health outcomes, 62.9 \% (n = 17) appeared to be associated with water
   contamination events that had received national media attention.
   Overall, based on the number and quality of eligible studies identified,
   we could not reach clear conclusions about the state of water quality,
   or its impacts on health, in any of Appalachia's subregions. More
   epidemiologic research is needed to understand contaminated water
   sources, ex-posures, and potentially associated health outcomes in
   Appalachia.},

Abstract = {Purpose: Assess whether children with developmental defects of enamel
   (DDE) in primary teeth hove a higher risk of having dental caries or a
   higher prevalence of clinical consequences due to the disease than those
   without DDE. Methods: Search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of
   Science 1 m, Cochrane Library, LILACS, 880, Embose databases and in gray
   literature. Three independent reviewers were involved in study
   selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. Risk of bias was
   evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. DDE and its subtypes
   (demarcated opacities, hypoplasia, hypomineralized second primary molars
   (HSPM), and fluorosis) were regarded as exposure. Dental caries and
   clinical consequences of untreated caries were also assessed. In the
   meta-analyses, odds ratio (OR) was used in the random effects model for
   dichotomous outcomes. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading
   Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results:
   The search yielded 5,750 studies, 39 of which were included in the
   systematic review and 20 in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias ranged
   from 4 to 9 points. Children with DDE were more prone to primary tooth
   caries (OR=2.79; 95\% CI:1.29-6.03), and so were those with demarcated
   opacities (OR=1.75; 95\% CI:1.09-2.78), hypoplasia (OR=2.84; 95\%
   CI:1.73-4.67), and HSPM (OR=2.89; 95\% CI:1.65-5.06). Fluorosis was not
   associated with caries (OR=139; 95\% CI:0.97498). Regarding tooth as a
   unit of analysis, DDE was highly associated with curies (OR=234; 95\%
   CI:1.74-3.16). As for the clinical consequences of caries, only the
   qualitative analysis was conducted and there was no consensus in the
   studies. Conclusion: DDE is associated with higher primary tooth caries
   experience.},

   under PFOA stress conditions: Integrated analysis of sludge
   characteristics and metagenomics},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {865},

Abstract = {The negative effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on biological
   nitrogen removal performance in wastewater treat-ment plants, are
   receiving increasing attention due to the widespread reporting of this
   issue. In this study, pomelo peel iron-loaded biochar (Fe-PBC) was added
   to an anammox bioreactor to alleviate the negative effects of PFOA.
   Results showed that the addition of Fe-PBC increased the ammonia and
   nitrite removal efficiencies from 77.7 +/- 9.6 \% and 79.5 +/- 5.6 \% to
   94.45 +/- 5.1 \% and 95.9 +/- 5.0 \%, respectively. In addition, Fe-PBC
   promoted the removal of PFOA from wastewater, increasing the PFOA
   removal efficiency from 5.2 \% to 29.2 +/- 4.3 \% from 100 to 200 days.
   The intro-duction of iron-loaded biochar into the anammox bioreactor
   increased the C\textbackslash{}\textbackslash{}O ratio by 13.64 \% by
   150 days. In addition, a C\_O fitting peak was detected in the Fe-PBC,
   indicating that the Fe-PBC was loaded with microorganisms. Microbial
   community analysis showed a decrease in the relative abundances of
   Proteobacteria and Nitrospirae from 31 \% and 3.4 \% to 16.8 \% and 0.9
   \%, respectively, while the relative abundance of Planctomycetes
   increased from 26.8 \% to 44.1 \%. Metagenomic analysis found that the
   functional genes hzsB and hdh increased from 98,666 +/- 11,400 and 3190
   +/- 460 to 119,333 +/- 15,534 and 138,650 +/- 11,233 copy numbers/MLSS.
   The increase in anammox biomass may be attributed to the presence of
   iron, an essential element for the synthesis of key anammox enzyme.
   Furthermore, iron was also associated with the enhanced extracellular
   electron transfer in the anammox system induced by Fe-PBC.},

Title = {Developmental Defects of Enamel: A Bibliometric Analysis of the Top 100
   Most-Cited Papers},
Journal = {CARIES RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 15},
Abstract = {Background: Developmental defects of enamel (DDE) are a result of
   disturbances during formation and maturation of the enamel. Evaluating
   the most-cited DDE papers can provide important tools that point to the
   gaps and strengths of this important topic in dentistry. Summary: This
   bibliometric study analyzed the 100 most-cited papers on DDE. Using a
   combined keyword search strategy, the 100 most-cited papers were
   selected in the Web of Science Core Collection. Papers that addressed
   any type of DDE were included. The extracted data were title, number of
   citations, study theme, authorship, journal, type of DDE, type of
   dentition (primary or permanent), type of diagnosis, study design, year,
   and country of publication. The bibliometric networks were generated
   through VOSviewer software. The 100 papers had a range from 78 to 459
   citations. The main themes of studies were etiopathogenesis (53\%),
   prevalence and incidence (22\%), and diagnosis (8\%). The authors with
   the highest number of citations were Goodman AH and Rose JC (459
   citations). Most articles were published in dental journals (47\%). The
   most studied types of DDE were fluorosis and amelogenesis imperfecta in
   the permanent dentition (47\%). Observational (24\%) and non-systematic
   reviews (24\%) were the most common study designs and ranged from 1977
   to 2019. The country with the highest number of publications was the USA
   (41\%). Key Messages: Most of the top 100 DDE papers were about
   fluorosis and amelogenesis imperfecta, with top papers from three
   continents with English as the native language. This topic is of great
   importance in dentistry, and the need for further studies is
   highlighted, especially regarding the diagnosis and treatment of some
   DDEs.},

Title = {Periprosthetic Fractures in Long Versus Short Proximal Femoral Nailing
   for Intertrochanteric Fractures: A 10-Year Single-Centre Cohort Study},
Journal = {CUREUS JOURNAL OF MEDICAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC 23},
Abstract = {Background Neck of femur (NOF) fractures, including intertrochanteric
   fractures, are common fragility fractures seen in the elderly population
   and are often amenable to fixation with a proximal femoral nail (PFN).
   However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the incidence of
   peri-prosthetic fractures with each device. Several studies from the
   1990s and a recent meta-analysis have shown a higher incidence of
   peri-prosthetic fractures in the short PFN cohort. Other studies have
   shown a lower reoperation rate with short PFNs, and no statistically
   significant differences have been quoted in the rates of peri-prosthetic
   fractures in systematic reviews.
   Aim The purpose of this retrospective study, therefore, was to assess
   the peri-prosthetic fracture rate and failure rates of elderly neck of
   femur (NOF) fractures implanted with either a short or long proximal
   femoral nail (PFN).
   Materials and methods A retrospective study was conducted in a single
   orthopaedic department (University Hospital Dorset, Poole, GBR) using
   collected data on all extracapsular neck of femur fracture patients from
   the national hip fracture database (NHFD) from January 1, 2011, to
   December 23, 2021. The data collected included patient age, sex, the
   American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) type of neck of femur
   fracture, type of surgery performed, any further peri-prosthetic
   fractures, and time to re-operation in that subset of the group. The
   implants used were the Stryker Gamma 3 Nail and the Smith Nephew (Trigen
   and Intertan). All patients were allowed to fully weight bear as
   tolerated and received both orthopaedic and elderly medical care.
   Failure was defined as a cut-out or implant fracture.
   Results From January 1, 2011, to December 23, 2021, there were 1010
   extracapsular neck of femur fractures recorded on the National Hip
   Fracture Database (NHFD) treated with a PFN from the study centre. Of
   those patients, 11 had pathological fractures and were excluded. 649
   patients had long PFNs, and 350 had short PFNs. Of the total of 999
   patients, 254 (25\%) were male and 745 (75\%) were female. More than
   80\% of the patients in the sample were over the age of 75. The majority
   of patients in both groups had A1/A2 fractures (short 84.3\%, long
   49.1\%). The rate of periprosthetic fractures in the short PFNs was
   1.71\%, and the failure rate was 0.57\%. The rate of periprosthetic
   fractures in the long PFNs was 0.62\%, with a failure rate of 0.92\%.
   The multi-nominal logistic regression model did not show statistically
   significant odds ratios (OR) for the following variables: long/short
   nails, male/female gender, age, ASA, or type of fracture. The female
   gender was associated with a higher risk of both periprosthetic
   fractures and failures (OR of 2.232 and 2.95), but this was not found to
   be statistically significant. Similarly, unstable A3 fractures had a
   much higher risk of failure (OR of 2.691) compared to periprosthetic
   fractures (OR of 0.985). However, this was not statistically
   significant.
   Conclusion Overall, this study has identified that in a patient
   population that is predominantly female and over the age of 75, the risk
   of periprosthetic fracture rate and the failure rate is similar in both
   the use of a short or a long PFN for intertrochanteric fractures.},

Abstract = {Objectives: High prevalence of risk factors for pelvic floor disorders
   (PFD) in the Eastern Mediterranean may result in higher rates of
   prevalence of PFD in comparison to other regions. Despite individual
   studies, there are no clear statistics on the cumulative prevalence of
   PFDs in the East Mediterranean region. The aim of this study was to
   investigate the prevalence of PFDs in the Eastern Mediterranean
   region.Methods: A literature search without language restriction was
   conducted in PubMed, Cochrane database and Web of Science from 2016 to
   01 June 2022. Cross-sectional and cohort studies that reported
   prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI), constipation, fecal
   incontinence (FI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) among women in the
   Eastern Mediterranean region were included. Study quality was assessed
   according to the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Data
   were pooled and meta-analysed using a random effects model. PROSPERO:
   CRD42021283127Results: The search yielded 390 articles, from which 12
   studies containing 9905 patients were included. Five studies were high
   quality and seven were low quality. The prevalence of POP (12 studies,
   9905 participants), UI (5 studies, 2340 participants), constipation (4
   studies, 2045 participants) and FI (1 study, 166 participants) was 39\%

Abstract = {The exposure of farmers to pesticides due to inadequate safety measures
   is a concern in low-income countries in Africa and Asia. However, until
   now, there have been limited studies on the farmers' risk due to
   pesticide application to fruit crops. The knowledge of farmers' exposure
   related to pesticide use and their safety practices was studied among
   100 banana farmers in three areas (Padampur, Jagatpur, and Thimura) of
   Chitwan district, Nepal. More than 75\% of the farmers complained about
   problems related to insects. Most frequently used insecticides in the
   area were chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Ten percent (10\%) of the
   applied pesticides were highly hazardous to humans, according to the
   World Health Organization hazard category, with skin rash being the most
   common acute symptom reported by 29\% of the farmers. Banned
   organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, such as endosulfan and
   triazophos, respectively, are still being used by farmers in the
   aforementioned areas. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed the lack
   of knowledge and safety practices among farmers leading to inadequate
   awareness related to the negative effects of pesticide use on human
   health and the environment. Therefore, government extension service can
   play a crucial role in improving banana farmers' knowledge of the toxic

Volume = {31},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Landfills are the hub of numerous kinds of contaminants. Plastic dumping
   in landfills around the world is considered a global concern considering
   environmental and human health risks. The landfill environmental
   condition accelerates the disintegration of plastics that ultimately
   turned into the emerging contaminant, microplastics (MPs). MPs
   disseminate in the peripheral environmental matrices through runoff and
   leachate leakage. Besides, MPs have the affinity for both organic and
   inorganic micropollutants to adsorb on their sur-face and assist in the
   amplification of many emergent micro-organic (e.g., polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)) and
   inorganic (e.g., heavy metals) pollutants. This mini-review conducts a
   literature review on the current publications on MPs in landfills and
   their contribution to emergent micropollutants in landfill sites.},

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},

Abstract = {Basin land-use interacts with hydrology to deliver chemical contaminants
   to riverine environments. These chemicals are eventually taken up by
   aquatic organisms, where they can cause harmful effects. However,
   knowledge gaps related to the connections between hydrological,
   chemical, and biological processes currently limit our ability to
   forecast potential future changes in contaminant concentrations
   accurately. In this study, concentrations of three pesticide classes
   (organochlorines, organophosphates, and herbicides) and a standard suite
   of trace metals were analyzed in the South Saskatchewan River, Canada in
   2020 and 2021 in water, sediments, and fishes. Organochlorine pesticides
   have been banned in Canada since the 1970s, yet there were some
   detections for methoxychlor and lindane, predominantly in sediment and
   fish samples, which could be attributed to legacy contamination. Except
   for malathion and parathion, organophosphate pesticides were scarcely
   detected in both sampling years in all matrices, and neonicotinoids were
   below detection in all samples. Conversely, the herbicides 2,4-D and
   dicamba were detected consistently throughout all locations in water
   samples for both sampling years. Overall, concentrations were 3 times
   higher in 2020 when river discharge was similar to 2 times higher,
   suggesting run-off from the surrounding catchment or disturbance of
   contaminated sediments. Analysis for trace metals revealed that Cu and
   Zn exceeded sediment quality guidelines in some locations. Mercury
   concentrations exceeded the guidelines for about 18\% of the samples
   (water and sediment) analyzed. These findings fill gaps in monitoring
   datasets and highlight key links between hydrology and chemistry that
   can be further explored in computational models to predict future
   contaminant trends in freshwater systems.},

Journal = {MEDICINE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {102},
Number = {38},
Month = {SEP 22},
Abstract = {Background: To critically evaluate the effects of different nursing
   measures based on the concept of fast-track surgery (FTS) on the
   negative emotions of patients with breast cancer.
   Methods: A systematic search of 8 databases, namely PubMed, Cochrane
   Library, Embase, Psycho info, China national knowledge infrastructure,
   Wanfang, China science and technology journal database, and China
   biomedical literature database, was performed to find randomized
   controlled trials from inception to April 2023. Two reviewers critically
   and independently assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane Collaboration
   criteria and extracted correlated data using the designed form. All
   analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3.
   Results: Ten studies were included in the systematic review, with a
   total of 830 patients (FTS group: 415; control group: 415). The results
   showed that different nursing measures based on the concept of FTS could
   significantly reduce anxiety (MD = -1.74, 95\% confidence intervals
   {[}-2.41, -1.08], P < .00001) and depression (MD = -1.98, 95\%
   confidence intervals {[}-2.44, -1.51], P < .00001) in patients after
   modified breast cancer surgery compared with the control group.
   Conclusions: Based on the concept of FTS, the nursing measures such as
   reducing preoperative fasting time, posture management, preventive
   analgesia, and early functional exercise can effectively reduce the
   anxiety and depression of patients during the perioperative period.},

Title = {Root exudates enhanced 6:2 FTOH defluorination, altered metabolite
   profiles and shifted soil microbiome dynamics},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {466},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {6:2 Fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), one of per- and polyfluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS), is widely used as a raw material in synthesizing
   surfactants and fluorinated polymers. However, little is known about the
   role of root exudates on 6:2 FTOH biodegradation in the rhizosphere.
   This study examined the effects of root exudates produced from dicot
   (Arabidopsis thaliana) and monocot (Brachypodium distachyon) grown under
   different nutrient conditions (nutrient -rich, sulfur -free, and
   potassium -free) on 6:2 FTOH biotransformation with or without
   bioaugmentating agent Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. All the exudates enhanced
   defluorination of 6:2 FTOH by glucose -grown RHA1. Amendment of dicot or
   monocot root exudates, regardless of the plant growth conditions, also
   enhanced 6:2 FTOH biotransformation in soil microcosms. Interestingly,
   high levels of humic-like substances in the root exudates are linked to
   high extents of 6:2 FTOH defluorination. Bioaugmenting strain RHA1 along
   with root exudates facilitated 6:2 FTOH transformation with a production
   of more diverse metabolites. Microbial community analysis revealed that
   Rhodococcus was predominant in all strain RHA1 spiked treatments.
   Different root exudates changed the soil microbiome dynamics. This study
   provided new insight into 6:2 FTOH biotransformation with different root
   exudates, suggesting that root exudates amendment and bioaugmentation
   are promising approaches to promote rhizoremediation for
   PFAS-contaminated soil.},

Abstract = {Directional drilling technology (DDT) originated from oil drilling
   industry. After many years of development, DDT has been extended to
   geological investigation and disaster management for tunnel engineering,
   aquifer reconstruction at the bottom of coal mines, pumping channel
   construction for power storage stations, municipal pipeline laying and
   other fields. Combined with the advantages of DDT for long-distance
   accurate crossing, ground grouting technology can achieve safe and
   efficient management of underground engineering disasters, and has a
   broad application prospect. This paper systematically reviews the
   development history, research status and key technologies of DDT.
   Firstly, the development history of DDT is introduced. Secondly, the
   scientific research plan, academic paper publication, relevant patent
   authorization, and application exploration of DDT are analysed. The
   analysis results show that the DDT in China has reached an
   internationally advanced level of technological independence and
   broad-range application, but there are still some core technical
   problems that need to be resolved, such as thousand-meter long-distance
   fast drilling, accurate drilling guidance in complex geological
   conditions, and accurate grouting in underground engineering. Focusing
   on the construction requirements of strategic major projects, this paper
   proposes four functional modules, i.e., forecasting, drilling, grouting
   and detecting, and analyses and discusses six aspects of ultra-long
   directional drilling and grouting (i.e., sensing prediction while
   drilling, rapid drilling and sticking prediction, precision guidance
   technology, remote gel controllable grouting material, pressure
   stabilizing and controlling sectional grouting process, and detection
   system with drilling). This paper can provide reference for the
   development of DDT, and for the prevention and control of disasters in
   underground engineering.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {901},
Month = {NOV 25},
Abstract = {In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), agriculture is the primary
   consumer of water and the biggest user of pesticides worldwide. Given
   that groundwater is a crucial resource in this region, a systematic
   review was conducted to evaluate the current state of knowledge on the
   presence of pesticides in aquifers. The review examined 48 research
   papers published between 1998 and 2020, and found that only six
   countries in the region have information on pesticides in groundwater. A
   total of 70 agrochemicals were detected, encompassing legacy pesticides,
   herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and metabolites. Herbicides,
   including the widely used atrazine and glyphosate, were the most
   commonly detected current-use pesticides. These herbicides are being
   gradually banned or restricted due to their potentially harmful effects
   on the environment. Factors that contribute to the presence of these
   contaminants in aquifers include preferential flows, seasonal variations
   in rainfall, aquifer type, unsaturated zone thickness, and land use and
   management practices. Researchers noted that analysis of these
   contaminants is often beyond the economic or methodological scope, and
   analytical capacity in the region is generally limited. Based on the
   findings of this review, there is a clear need for groundwater pesticide
   monitoring in the region to reduce health risks to humans and
   ecosystems.},

Abstract = {Aegle marmelos or bael is a medicinally important tree species used in
   various Indian traditional systems of medicines. In the present study, a
   sensitive and rapid high-performance thin-layer chromatography method
   was developed for the simultaneous determination of marmelosin,
   umbelliferone, and psoralen from the four different aerial parts of A.
   marmelos. The method uses HPTLC silica gel 60 RP-18 W plates as
   stationary phase, and acetonitrile: 0.1\% orthophosphoric acid in water
   (1:1 v/v) as solvent system. The developed method is validated for
   specificity, precision, repeatability, and accuracy in accordance with
   International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Further, the
   estimation of heavy metal suggested that the A. marmelos bark sample was
   highly contaminated with cadmium (3.8 +/- 0.7 mu g/g) which was far from
   the permissible range as described by World Health Organization (WHO).
   The observed chromium concentration was higher in the bark and the fruit
   than the normal range recorded in the plants. Arsenic and lead content
   was within the permissible range, while mercury was not detected in any
   of the tested samples. Studied samples were further tested for the
   presence of organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticides, as well as
   organophosphate and carbamates. Results suggested that
   gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) was more prominent and detected
   in the bark and the young twig samples. Carbamates were not detected in
   any of the samples. Aflatoxins were absent from all the samples analyzed
   through ultra-performance liquid chromatography -fluorescence (UPLC-FLR)
   analysis. The present study demonstrated that phytochemicals and
   physicochemical estimation are highly required for maintaining the
   quality of the raw drugs before the preparation of any formulations.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {215},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Background: In low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), pesticides are
   widely used in agricultural and resi-dential settings. Little is known
   about how pesticides affect child growth. Objectives: To systematically
   review and synthesise the evidence on the associations between pesticide
   exposure and adverse birth outcomes and/or impaired postnatal growth in
   children up to 5 years of age in LMICs.Methods: We searched 10 databases
   from inception through November 2021. We included cohort and
   cross-sectional studies investigating associations between self-reported
   or measured prenatal or postnatal pesticide exposure and child growth
   (postnatal child linear/ponderal growth, and/or birth outcomes). Two
   researchers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed certainty
   using GRADE. The protocol was preregistered with PROSPERO
   (CRD42021292919).Results: Of 939 records retrieved, 31 studies met
   inclusion criteria (11 cohort, 20 cross-sectional). All studies assessed
   prenatal exposure. Twenty-four studies reported on birth weight. Four
   found positive associations with organochlorines (0.01-0.25 standardised
   mean difference (SMD)) and two found negative associations (-0.009 SMD
   to-55 g). Negative associations with organophosphates (-170 g, n = 1)
   and pyrethroids (-97 to-233 g, n = 2) were also documented. Two (out of
   15) studies reporting on birth length found positive associations with
   organochlorines (0.21-0.25 SMD) and one found negative associations
   (-0.25 to-0.32 SMD). Organophosphate exposure was negatively associated
   with birth length (-0.37 cm, n = 1). Organophosphate exposure was also
   associated with higher risk/prevalence of low birth weight (2 out of
   nine studies) and preterm birth (2 out of six studies). Certainty of the
   evidence was ``very low{''} for all outcomes.Conclusion: The limited
   literature from LMICs shows inconclusive associations between prenatal
   pesticide exposure, child growth, and birth outcomes. Studies with
   accurate quantitative data on exposure to commonly used pesticides in
   LMICs using consistent methodologies in comparable populations are
   needed to better un-derstand how pesticides influence child growth.},

Abstract = {The pesticide is any substance used to prohibit, destroy, or control
   pests, such as insects, fungus, rodents or, undesirable plant species
   that cause damage during crop production and storage.
   There are a lot of traditional methods to detect pesticides, among them
   gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC),
   and their combinations with ultraviolet (UV) or mass spectroscopy.
   Nevertheless, these conventional techniques have several limitations,
   involving complicated pre-treatment steps, requiring expensive
   instruments, operational difficulty, lack of instrument portability, and
   difficulties in real-time monitoring.
   Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is one of the current leading
   techniques widely applied for the ultrasensitive detection of pesticides
   molecules. SERS takes advantage to combine the high specificity of Raman
   scattering with the signal amplification of electromagnetic enhancement
   provided by the excitation of surface Plasmon resonances in metallic
   nanostructures, together with the charge transfer mechanisms established
   between metal surfaces and analytes.
   In this brief review, types of classification of pesticides that can be
   classed have been reported. These classifications can provide valuable
   information on the chemistry of pesticides. The state of art of SERS,
   including a theoretical background study, is briefly described. Finally,
   some recent development and applications of optical and analytical
   techniques for pesticides detection have been summarized; a particular
   study will be focused on SERS combined with microfluidic technology that
   has appeared as advanced tools for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy
   (SERS). They have been demonstrated to be interesting for in situ and
   real-time detection of analytes at extremely low concentrations.},

Title = {Association between developmental defects of enamel and early childhood
   caries in children under 6 years old: A systematic review and
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {8},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Early childhood caries (ECC) are an oral health problem worldwide in
   children under 6 years of age. This disease of rapid development has a
   multifactorial etiology, and one of the possible risk factors is
   developmental defects of enamel (DDE), such as hypoplasia and opacities.
   The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the association
   between DDE and ECC in children under 6 years of age. An electronic
   search was conducted until March 2022 using Medline (PubMed), Scopus,
   Science-Direct, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCO-Host,
   EMBASE, and Google Scholar and complemented with a manual search, with
   no restrictions on language or date of publication. Longitudinal studies
   of children under 6 years of age with primary dentition were included. A
   total of 1158 studies were found, of which 651 records were reviewed by
   title and abstract, and 24 articles were selected for full-text
   evaluation. Finally, nine studies that met the selection criteria were
   included in the quali-tative synthesis. Study quality and certainty were
   assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Grading of
   Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool.
   Three cohort studies of good quality were included in the meta-analysis.
   A risk associated with DDE (RR = 1.94; 95\% CI: 1.52-2.49) and a risk
   associated with enamel hypoplasia (RR = 5.45; 95\% CI: 1.84-16.14) were
   found. The results for diffuse opacity (RR = 1.21; 95\% CI: 0.18-8.15)
   and demarcated opacity (RR = 1.26; 95\% CI: 0.43-3.65) were not
   significant. GRADE analysis presented low and very low certainty of
   evidence. It was concluded that there is an association between DDE and
   ECC. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of
   the limitations of the study. The protocol for this study has been
   registered in PROSPERO under identification number CRD42021238919.},

Title = {Micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge: A systematic
   review on the impact of pyrolysis operating conditions},
Journal = {WASTE MANAGEMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {174},
Pages = {618-629},
Month = {FEB 15},
Abstract = {Biochar obtained from sewage sludge serves as a valuable soil amendment
   in agriculture, enhancing soil properties by increasing the nutrient
   content, cation exchange capacity, water retention, and oxygen
   transmission. However, its utilisation is hampered by the presence of
   micropollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs),
   polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans
   (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and volatile organic
   compounds (VOCs). Previous studies indicate that the type and amount of
   micropollutants can be significantly adjusted by selecting the right
   process parameters. This literature review provides an overview of how
   (1) pyrolysis temperature, (2) carrier gas flow and type, (3) heating
   rate, and (4) residence time affect the concentration of micropollutants
   in biochar produced from sewage sludge. The micropollutants targeted are
   those listed by the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and by the
   International Biochar Institution (IBI), including PAHs, PCDD/Fs, PCBs
   and VOCs. In addition, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are
   also considered due to their presence in sewage sludge. The findings
   suggest that higher pyrolysis temperatures reduce micropollutant levels.
   Moreover, the injection of a carrier gas (N2 or CO2) during the
   pyrolysis and cooling processes effectively lowers PAHs and PCDD/Fs, by
   reducing the contact of biochar with oxygen, which is crucial in
   mitigating micropollutants. Nevertheless, limited available data impedes
   an assessment of the impact of these parameters on PFAS in biochar. In
   addition, further research is essential to understand the effects of
   carrier gas type, heating rate, and residence time in order to determine
   the optimal pyrolysis process parameters for generating clean biochar.},

   diagnosed with AUD accepting psy-chotherapies was conducted. Studies
   covering 9 countries and regions. The qualitative analysis pooled 2646
   individuals from 34 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the networks
   included 1928 participants (23 RCTs). The outcomes included percentage
   of days abstinent (PDA), change in drinks per drinking day (change in

Abstract = {The development of efficient catalysts for application in the
   Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is of great relevance. Supported cobalt
   is preferred, and the choice of support is critical to the success of
   the process. For this, graphene materials have grown in interest due to
   their unique and appreciable characteristics. Thus, this study aims to
   perform a systematic review of previous studies which evaluated the use
   of graphene materials as support means for cobalt FTS catalysts. Twelve
   studies from the last five years were selected for extraction and
   analysis of results. The main parameters that influenced the catalytic
   activity of FTS catalysts were discussed, such as the type of support
   used, the chosen preparation method, and the graphene functionalization
   method. The results showed that the catalysts synthesized from different
   types of graphene support obtained CO conversion rates between 20 and
   86.9\% and high selectivity for C5 + compounds in the gasoline range.
   Furthermore, the functionalization of graphene with functional groups
   and pretreatment with nitric acid was essential to adjust the
   metal-support interaction and ensure catalytic efficiency. The
   preparation of catalysts involves a series of parameters that must be
   considered to ensure that the Co/C ratio produces an optimal particle
   size, consequently presenting better efficiency. Finally, this work
   highlights the potential to be explored of graphene materials used as
   support for FTS catalysts and their promising results.},

Abstract = {Undergoing pelvic floor reconstructive surgery bears a lifetime risk
   between 14\% and 19\%, with a significantly higher risk in elderly and
   postmenopausal women. The traditional preferred surgical approach for
   pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is vaginal hysterectomy (VH) with or
   without pelvic floor repair. Uterine pathology treatments via
   hysterectomy for women, including premalignant conditions and fibroids,
   typically opt for the VH route. A shorter recovery time and faster
   return to daily activities have been associated with VH, as this
   procedure leaves no large abdominal incision (which may produce further
   wound-related complications and higher levels of pain during the
   recovery process). A proposed preemptive anesthetic modality aimed at
   minimizing postoperative pain (as well as narcotic and opioid
   consumption) is the application of infiltration of local anesthetics
   during pelvic floor reconstructive surgeries. This study aimed to
   evaluate infiltration of local anesthetics and their impact on
   perioperative outcomes for women, as well as postoperative pain for
   patients undergoing VH for the surgical management of PFDs. Abstract
   selection took place via 3 authors (A.P., A.D., and D.Z.), who used the
   following meta-analysis inclusion criteria: randomized controlled trials
   (RCTs) comparing outcomes of patients undergoing VH due to PFDs and/or
   other benign indications (ie, fibroids, uterine bleeding, precancerous
   conditions) and received either intraoperative infiltration with local
   analgesic or not. Comparator groups consisted of VH-eligible patients
   who received placebo injections of normal saline solution in place of
   local anesthetic. Main outcomes of the study were postoperative pain
   scores and opioid use. Excluded studies were any case reports,
   nonrandomized trials, or animal studies. The databases searched for
   articles published up to January 2022 included MEDLINE (1966-2022),
   Scopus (2004-2022), Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, and
   ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Authors retrieved the full text of those
   studies deemed to meet the criteria. Overall, 5 RCTs were included in
   the analysis. Their data included 277 women who underwent a VH, with the
   local analgesia (LA) group patients, or those receiving preemptive local
   infiltration analgesia, consisting of 139 patients, whereas the control
   group (patients in the non-LA group who received no preemptive LA)
   included 138 patients. The main analgesic regimen was 0.5\% bupivacaine
   with 1:200,000 epinephrine followed by 0.5\% ropivacaine. Total
   anesthetic injection amounts ranged from 20 to 50 mL from study to
   study. In addition, injection sites exhibited variation, but the
   uterosacral ligaments were the most prevalent sites of local analgesic
   injection. Also, opioid-based consumption up to 24 hours postoperatively
   was significantly reduced in the LA group when compared with the non-LA
   group (197 patients). Overall, the average postoperative scores at both
   30 minutes to 2 hours and 3 to 6 hours postoperatively were
   significantly lower in the LA group when compared with the non-LA group.
   Despite this, the postoperative pain scores later up to 24 hours
   postoperatively did not differ between groups. A major strength of the
   study was the authors' choice to set aside data restrictions to
   eliminate data losses. This study is the first to present outcomes from
   existing RCTs of local infiltration analgesia use before surgical
   incision during VH.
   Limitations of the study include a limited number of existing studies
   from which data were pulled, thereby hindering the ability to draw safe
   conclusions. The relatively small level of evidence could hinder
   accurate summaries of local anesthetic effects, with the possibility of
   overestimation/underestimation on the identified effects. The authors
   included some studies that were not yet published at the time of review.
   An additional weakness was the variation of the methodological quality
   of recruited studies due to design differences, included populations,
   and methodology. Significant heterogeneity was detected in areas such as
   analgesic regimens utilized, injected dosage, injection locations, and
   indication for surgery. Preemptive application of LA in patients
   undergoing VH for PFDs appears as a safe and beneficial use of
   anesthetic in terms of hospital stay, opioid use, and short-term
   postoperative pain. However, additional studies would be required to
   identify dosages, the optimal anesthetic regimen, and application sites
   to achieve the peak postoperative benefit.},

   understand the metabolic response characteristics of anammox bacteria to
   different environmental factors, and then guide the application of the
   anammox process. This review presented the latest advances of the
   research progress of the effects of different environmental factors on
   the metabolic pathway of anammox bacteria. The effects as well as
   mechanisms of conventional environ-mental factors and emerging
   pollutants on the anammox metabolic processes were summarized. Also, the
   role of quorum sensing (QS) mediating the bacteria growth, gene
   expression and other metabolic process in the anammox system were also
   reviewed. Finally, interaction and cross-feeding mechanisms of microbial
   commu-nities in the anammox system were discussed. This review
   systematically summarized the variations of metabolic mechanism response
   to the external environment and cross-feeding interactions in the
   anammox process, which would provide an in-depth understanding for the
   anammox metabolic process and a comprehensive guidance for future
   anammox-related metabolic studies and engineering applications.},

Title = {To what extent are filter feeder elasmobranchs exposed to marine
   pollution? A systematic review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {318},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Filter feeding elasmobranchs may be considered as biological indicators
   of marine pollution, despite most of these species are under some degree
   of extinction risk. Among threats to this taxonomic group, marine
   pollution might represent an additional concern for their survival. In
   this review, a comprehensive systematic search of scientific literature
   on pollutants in filter feeding elasmobranchs was conducted to evaluate
   the bioaccumulation patterns, and risk for human consumers. We found
   that, despite an increasing trend in the number of published studies,
   the geographical coverage is still very limited and most of the studies
   focused solely on trace elements (70.8\%). Among sharks, Rhincodon typus
   was the most represented species (66.7\%), while Mobula mobular the most
   studied ray species (41.7\%). Comparing the levels of pollutants in
   filter feeders between ocean basins, this review highlighted that Hg, As
   and Cd levels are mostly higher in those areas affected by both strong
   natural and anthropogenic source of emissions, such as the Indian Ocean.
   With regards to OCs, SPCB levels in muscle of C. maximus were between
   4.3 and 50.5 mu g kg(-1) ww, highlighting a persistent contamination of
   PCB in the Mediterranean Sea. Some species exceeded the maximum
   allowable limits for foodstuff consumption for As, Cd and Pb. A total of
   77.8\% of the analyzed species exceeded the Environmental Quality
   Standards for Hg, while they were always below the EQS(biota) for HCB,
   PBDEs, PFOS and DDT. Given their feeding mechanism that continuously
   samples the marine environment, further investigations are urgently
   needed to determine not only the extent of contaminant exposure in
   different hotspot locations but also the risks posed to the elasmobranch
   health.},

Abstract = {Arsenic, a metalloid that exists by nature, reaches the earth either by
   natural or anthropogenic events and is considered an emerging pollutant.
   The existence of arsenic in soil systems is a fate to the environment
   since it is mobile and being transported to other systems because of its
   bioavailability and speciation process. Arsenic transformation in the
   soil and its thorough understanding of how it enters plant systems are
   crucial. Notably, transporters are responsible for most of the arsenic
   that enters the plant system. Consumption of crops or animals and
   drinking water polluted with arsenic are the prime factors in
   transmitting arsenic to people. Severe adverse effects on humans arise
   as an outcome of long-term contact with arsenic-rich foodstuff and
   water. An effort has been made to outline the several sources and their
   dynamics in the surroundings and health impact on humans in this review.
   In addition, various strategies have been practiced to remove arsenic in
   the soil and water systems is also addressed.},

   exposure-induced disturbed spermatogenesis},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {267},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {As the concerned emerging pollutants, several lines of evidence have
   indicated that nanoplastics (NPs) lead to reproductive toxicity.
   However, the biological mechanism underlying NPs disturbed
   spermatogenesis remains largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to reveal
   the potential mechanism of impaired spermatogenesis caused by long-term
   NPs exposure from the perspective of integrated metabolome and
   microbiome analysis. After 12 weeks of gavage of polystyrene
   nanoplastics (PS-NPs) and animomodified polystyrene nanoplastics
   (Amino-NPs), a well-designed two-exposure stages experimental condition.
   We found that NPs exposure induced apparent abnormal spermatogenesis,
   which appeared more severe in the Amino-NPs group. Mechanistically, 14
   floras associated with glucose and lipid metabolism were significantly
   altered, as evidenced by 16 S rRNA sequencing. Testicular metabolome
   revealed that the Top 50 changed metabolites were also enriched in lipid
   metabolism. Subsequently, the combined gut microbiome and metabolome
   analysis uncovered the strong correlations be-tween Klebsiella, Blautia,
   Parabacteroides, and lipid metabolites (e.g., PC, LysoPC and GPCho). We
   speculate that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota-related disturbed lipid
   metabolism may be responsible for long-term NPs-induced damaged
   spermatogenesis, which provides new insights into NPs-induced
   dysregulated spermatogenesis.},

Title = {A comprehensive multiplatform metabolomic analysis reveals alterations
   of 2-hydroxybutyric acid among women with deep endometriosis related to
   the pesticide trans-nonachlor},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {918},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Background: Exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been
   related to the risk of endometriosis however the mechanisms remain
   unclear. The objective of the present study was to characterize the
   metabolic profiles underpinning the associations between POPs and
   endometriosis risk. Methodology: A hospital-based case-control study was
   conducted in France to recruit women with and without surgically
   confirmed deep endometriosis. Women's serum was analyzed using gas and
   liquid chromatography coupled to high -resolution mass spectrometry
   (HRMS) to measure the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs),
   organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) and per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances
   (PFAS). A comprehensive metabolomic profiling was conducted using
   targeted HRMS and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) to cover polar
   and non -polar fractions. A ``meet -in -the -middle{''} statistical
   framework was applied to identify the metabolites related to
   endometriosis and POP levels, using multivariate linear and logistic
   regressions adjusting for confounding variables. Results: Fourteen PCBs,
   six OCPs and six PFAS were widely found in almost all serum samples. The
   pesticide trans-nonachlor was the POP most strongly and positively
   associated with deep endometriosis risk, with odds ratio (95 \%
   confidence interval) of 2.42 (1.49; 4.12), followed by PCB180 and 167.
   Women with endometriosis exhibited a distinctive metabolic profile, with
   elevated serum levels of lactate, ketone bodies and multiple amino acids
   and lower levels of bile acids, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), cortisol and
   hippuric acid. The metabolite 2hydroxybutyrate was simultaneously
   associated to endometriosis risk and exposure to trans-nonachlor.
   Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
   comprehensive metabolome-wide association study of endometriosis,
   integrating ultra -trace profiling of POPs. The results confirmed a
   metabolic alteration among women with deep endometriosis that could be
   also associated to the exposure to POPs. Further observational and
   experimental studies will be required to delineate the causal ordering
   of those associations and gain insight on the underlying mechanisms.},

   DDD has the potential to foster profound learning experiences by
   providing a framework that invites educators and researchers to
   research, investigate, and evaluate the actual designs that are being
   used in classrooms, where teachers are actively involved in the design
   process. A new way of thinking about planning, carrying out, and

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {439},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {The ubiquitous presence of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in ocean environments
   threatens marine organisms. However, its effects on immunity of marine
   invertebrates at environmentally realistic levels are still largely
   unknown. In this study, the immunotoxicity of PCP to a representative
   bivalve species was evaluated. In addition, its impacts on metabolism,
   energy supply, detoxification, and oxidative stress status were also
   analysed by physiological examination as well as comparative
   transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to reveal potential mechanisms
   underpinning. Results illustrated that the immunity of blood clams was
   evidently hampered upon PCP exposure. Additionally, significant
   alterations in energy metabolism were detected in PCP-exposed clams.
   Meanwhile, the expressions of key detoxification genes and the in vivo
   contents (or activity) of key detoxification enzymes were markedly
   altered. Exposure to PCP also triggered significant elevations in
   intracellular ROS and MDA whereas evident suppression of haemocyte
   viability. The abovementioned findings were further supported by
   transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Our results suggest that PCP
   may hamper the immunity of the blood clam by (i) constraining the
   cellular energy supply through disrupting metabolism; and (ii) damaging
   haemocytes through inducing oxidative stress. Considering the high
   similarity of immunity among species, many marine invertebrates may be
   threatened by PCP, which deserves more attention.},

Title = {Pentachlorophenol exposure induced neurotoxicity by disrupting
   citrulline metabolism in larvae and adult zebrafish},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {478},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant with
   various adverse effects. Although its neurotoxicity has been reported,
   the underlying mechanism and subsequent detoxification remain unclear.
   In this study, embryos and adult zebrafish were exposed to PCP to
   determine its potential neurotoxic mechanism and protective indicators.
   The survival rate, heart rate, mobility time, active status and moving
   distance were significantly decreased in larvae after 30 mu g/L PCP
   exposure. Likewise, the mobile time, latency to the first movement,
   velocity and moving distance of adult zebrafish were significantly
   reduced by PCP exposure. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of larvae
   revealed that arginine and proline metabolism was the primary pathway
   affected by PCP exposure, reflected by increased proline and decreased
   citrulline (CIT) contents, which were confirmed by quantitative data.
   PCP exposure suppressed the conversion from arginine to CIT in larvae by
   downregulating the expression of nos1 and nos2a. Ornithine content was
   increased in the brains and intestines of adult zebrafish after PCP
   exposure, which inhibited ornithine catabolism to CIT by downregulating
   otc, resulting in reduced CIT. Intriguingly, CIT supplementation
   significantly restored the neurobehavioral defects induced by PCP in
   larvae and adult zebrafish. CIT supplementation upregulated the
   expression of ef1 alpha and tuba1 in larvae and inhibited the
   downregulation of ef1 alpha in the brains of adult zebrafish. Taken
   together, these results indicated that CIT supplementation could protect
   against PCP-induced neurotoxicity by upregulating the expression of
   genes involved in neuronal development and function.},

   degradation by potential microbes: Current findings and future outlook},
Journal = {MICROBIOLOGICAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {273},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Industrial processes result in the production of heavy metals, dyes,
   pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals,
   micropollutants, and PFAS (per-and polyfluorinated substances). Heavy
   metals are currently a significant problem in drinking water and other
   natural water bodies, including soil, which has an adverse impact on the
   environment as a whole. The heavy metal is highly poisonous,
   carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic to humans as well as other
   animals. Multiple polluted sites, including terrestrial and aquatic
   ecosystems, have been observed to co-occur with heavy metals and
   organo-pollutants. Pesticides and heavy metals can be degraded and
   removed concurrently from various metals and pesticide-contaminated
   matrixes due to microbial processes that include a variety of bacteria,
   both aerobic and anaerobic, as well as fungi. Numerous studies have
   examined the removal of heavy metals and organic-pollutants from
   different types of systems, but none of them have addressed the removal
   of these co-occurring heavy metals and organic pollutants and the use of
   microbes to do so. Therefore, the main focus of this review is on the
   recent developments in the concurrent microbial degradation of
   organo-pollutants and heavy metal removal. The limitations related to
   the simultaneous removal and degradation of heavy metals and
   organo-pollutant pollutants have also been taken into account.},

Abstract = {Rhodococcus opacus is a bacterium thathas a hightolerance to aromatic
   compounds and can produce significant amountsof triacylglycerol (TAG).
   Here, we present iGR1773, the first genome-scalemodel (GSM) of R. opacus
   PD630 metabolism based onits genomic sequence and associated data. The
   model includes 1773genes, 3025 reactions, and 1956 metabolites, was
   developed in a reproduciblemanner using CarveMe, and was evaluated
   through Metabolic Model tests(MEMOTE). We combine the model with two
   Constraint-Based Reconstructionand Analysis (COBRA) methods that use
   transcriptomics data to predictgrowth rates and fluxes: E-Flux2 and SPOT
   (Simplified Pearson Correlationwith Transcriptomic data). Growth rates
   are best predicted by E-Flux2.Flux profiles are more accurately
   predicted by E-Flux2 than flux balanceanalysis (FBA) and parsimonious
   FBA (pFBA), when compared to 44 centralcarbon fluxes measured by
   C-13-Metabolic Flux Analysis (C-13-MFA). Under glucose-fed conditions,
   E-Flux2 presents an R (2) value of 0.54, while predictions based onpFBA
   had an inferior R (2) of 0.28. We attributethis improved performance to
   the extra activity information providedby the transcriptomics data. For
   phenol-fed metabolism, in which thesubstrate first enters the TCA cycle,
   E-Flux2's flux predictionsdisplay a high R (2) of 0.96 while pFBA
   showedan R (2) of 0.93. We also show that glucosemetabolism and phenol
   metabolism function with similar relative ATPmaintenance costs. These
   findings demonstrate that iGR1773 can helpthe metabolic engineering
   community predict aromatic substrate utilizationpatterns and perform
   computational strain design.},

Abstract = {As an emerging pollutant, benzalkonium chlorides (BACs) potentially
   enriched in waste activated sludge (WAS). How-ever, the microbial
   response mechanism under chronic effects of BACs on acidogenesis and
   methanogenesis in anaer-obic digestion (AD) has not been clearly
   disclosed. This study investigated the AD (by-)products and microbial
   evolution under low to high BACs concentrations from bioreactor startup
   to steady running. It was found that BACs can lead to an increase of WAS
   hydrolysis and fermentation, but a disturbance to acidogenic bacteria
   also occurred at low BACs concentration. A noticeable inhibition to
   methanogenesis occurred when BAC concentration was up to 15 mg/g TSS.
   Metagenomic analysis revealed the key genes involved in acetic acid
   (HAc) biosynthesis (i.e. phosphate acetyltransferase, PTA),
   beta-oxidation pathway (acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase) and propionic
   acid (HPr) conversion was slightly promoted compared with control.
   Furthermore, BACs inhibited the acetotrophic methanogenesis (i.e.
   acetyl-CoA synthetase), especially BAC concentration was up to 15 mg/g
   TSS, thereby enhanced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) accumulation.
   Overall, chronic stimulation of functional microorganisms with
   increasing concentrations of BACs impact WAS fermentation.},

Abstract = {Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE),a novel brominated flame retardant,is
   becoming increasingly prevalent in environmental and biota samples.While
   DBDPE has been shown to cause various biological adverse effects,the
   molecular mechanism behind these effects is still unclear. Inthis
   research, zebrafish embryos were exposed to DBDPE (50-400 \& mu;g/L)
   until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). The results confirmedthe
   neurotoxicity by increased average swimming speed,
   interferedneurotransmitter contents, and transcription of
   neurodevelopment-relatedgenes in zebrafish larvae. Metabolomics analysis
   revealed changesof metabolites primarily involved in glycolipid
   metabolism, oxidativephosphorylation, and oxidative stress, which were
   validated throughthe alterations of multiple biomarkers at various
   levels. We furtherevaluated the mitochondrial performance upon DBDPE
   exposure and foundinhibited mitochondrial oxidative respiration

   activities, mitochondrialmembrane potential, and ATP contents. However,
   addition of nicotinamideriboside could effectively restore DBDPE-induced
   mitochondrial impairmentsand resultant neurotoxicity, oxidative stress

Title = {A meta-analysis highlighting the increasing relevance of the hair matrix
   in exposure assessment to organic pollutants},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {917},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Owing to a wide range of advantages, such as stability,
   non-invasiveness, and ease of sampling, hair has been used progressively
   for comprehensive biomonitoring of organic pollutants for the last three
   decades. This has led to the development of new analytical and
   multi-class analysis methods for the assessment of a broad range of
   organic pollutants in various population groups, ranging from
   small-scale studies to advanced studies with a large number of
   participants based on different exposure settings. This meta-analysis
   summarizes the existing literature on the assessment of organic
   pollutants in hair in terms of residue levels, the correlation of hair
   residue levels with those of other biological matrices and
   socio-demographic factors, the reliability of hair versus other
   biomatrices for exposure assessment, the use of segmental hair analysis
   for chronic exposure evaluation and the effect of external contamination
   on hair residue levels. Significantly high concentrations of organic
   pollutants such as pesticides, flame retardants, polychlorinated
   biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were reported in human
   hair samples from different regions and under different exposure
   settings. Similarly, high concentrations of pesticides (from
   agricultural activities), flame retardants (E-waste dismantling
   activities), dioxins and furans were observed in various occupational
   settings. Moreover, significant correlations (p < 0.05) for hair and
   blood concentrations were observed in majority of studies featuring
   pesticides and flame retardants. While among sociodemographic factors,
   gender and age significantly affected the hair concentrations in females
   and children in general exposure settings, whereas adult workers in
   occupational settings. Furthermore, the assessment of the hair burden of
   persistent organic pollutants in domestic and wild animals showed high
   concentrations for pesticides such as HCHs and DDTs whereas the
   laboratory-based studies using animals demonstrated strong correlations
   between exposure dose, exposure duration, and measured organic pollutant
   levels, mainly for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, terbuthylazine, aldrin,
   dieldrin and pyrethroid metabolites. Considering the critical analysis
   of the results obtained from literature review, hair is regarded as a
   reliable matrix for organic pollutant assessment; however, some
   limitations, as discussed in this review, need to be overcome to
   reinforce the status of hair as a suitable matrix for exposure
   assessment.},

   Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {EXPOSURE AND HEALTH},

Month = {2023 OCT 4},
Abstract = {Osteoporosis is a complex non-communicable disease characterized by low
   bone mineral density (BMD). Exposure to environmental factors such as
   air pollution and heavy metals has been linked to low BMD. This study
   aimed to review the emerging evidence investigating the associations
   between exposure to environmental chemicals and human bone mineral
   density or the risk of osteoporosis. A comprehensive electronic search
   was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase up to March
   3, 2022. Beta coefficients were extracted with 95\% confidence intervals
   to calculate pooled mean differences for BMD in random effect models.
   For data synthesis, main exposure groups were identified using the
   Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals,
   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Overall, 3181 records
   were identified. We reviewed 27 English articles with an analytical
   observational study design. In quantitative analysis, exposure to
   perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was significantly associated with low
   spinal BMD among women (mean difference = - 0.01 g/cm2, 95\% CI - 0.02
   to - 0.004 g/cm2). Up to date, there is supportive evidence for the
   inverse associations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and phthalates
   with BMD. The association of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)
   with BMD seems to vary by specific urinary PAHs and bone sites. For
   bisphenols and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), the evidence for
   negative associations with BMD is insufficient. For other groups,
   including triclosan, polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated
   dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs),
   the research is controversial or scant and needs to be extended.
   Available high-quality evidence supports the association between
   exposure to some environmental chemicals and lower BMD as well as
   increased risk of osteoporosis.},

Abstract = {Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of
   pioglitazone on Parkinson's disease (PD) in diabetes patients. Methods:
   A study search was carried out in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science
   databases from inception to July 22, 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale
   was used to evaluate the quality of the eligible studies. The risk ratio
   (RR) and 95\% confidence intervals (CI) were used as effect size
   indicators in this meta-analysis to evaluate the risk association
   between pioglitazone and PD. The Cochran's Q and I2 tests were used to
   assess statistical het-erogeneity. A dose-response meta-analysis was
   conducted using the least squares trend estimation method.Results: Three
   studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. Compared with diabetes
   patients who did not use pioglitazone, there was a significant reduction
   in the risk of PD (RR of 0.87 {[}95 \% CI 0.62-0.99, P = 0.039]) in
   pioglitazone users. No significant difference in PD risk was noted in
   diabetes patients taking 438 dose-duration -days (DDDs) of pioglitazone
   or lower compared with those who did not. When the DDD of pioglitazone
   was 438, the RR was 0.85 (95 \% CI {[}0.72-1.00], P = 0.05). When the
   DDD of pioglitazone was > 438, the risk of PD in patients with diabetes
   was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and showed an approximate linear
   correlation trend.Conclusion: Pioglitazone administration in PD in
   diabetes patients is significantly associated with a decrease in the
   risk of PD.},

Month = {AUG 15},
Abstract = {Plastic production is continuously increasing worldwide for daily use.
   Micro-plastics and nano-plastics remain major emerging pollutants and
   threaten the environment, ecosystem, human health, and well-being.
   Micro-nanoplastics (MNPs) are also exposed to humans through cosmetics,
   inhalation, ingestion, drinking water, dietary sources, and drug
   formulations. Oral uptake is the major among the different exposure
   routes of MNPs to humans. After entry, it gets absorbed due to its nano
   size (<100 nm) and easily distributed to all parts of the body through
   blood, affecting multiple organs, especially vital organs of the human
   body leading to severe diseases. It causes cancer, heart, liver, and
   kidney diseases, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and affects the brain.
   Its adsorption with protein leads to multi-layered corona formation in
   human blood plasma. MNPs interact with immune cells and induce
   pro-inflammatory mediators, inflammatory reactions, reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) production, and associated cytotoxicity. MNPs suppress T
   lymphocyte activity which results in a lack of immune regulation leading
   to autoimmune diseases. Hence, it is necessary to understand the impact
   of MNPs exposure on humans. Strict control measures for the production
   and use of plastics and developing appropriate strategies for safe
   disposal would prevent MNPs-mediated toxicity in humans.},

   attenuates its phytotoxicity},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {893},
Month = {OCT 1},
Abstract = {Sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) are ubiquitous in surface water and soil
   environments, raising considerable concerns about their risk and
   removal. However, the impacts of various bromide ion (Br-)
   concentrations on the phytotoxicity, uptake and fate of SAs in plant
   growth and physiological metabolism of plants have not been well
   understood. Our research demonstrated that low concentrations of Br-
   (0.1, 0.5 mM) promoted the uptake and degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ)
   in wheat and attenuated the phytotoxicity of SDZ. Additionally, we
   proposed a degradation pathway and identified the brominated product of
   SDZ (SDZBr), which attenuated the dihydrofolate synthesis inhibition by
   SDZ. The primary mechanism was that Br-reduced the level of reactive
   oxygen radicals (ROS) and alleviated oxidative damage. The production of
   SDZBr and the high consumption of H2O2 suggest the potential generation
   of reactive bromine species, contributing to the degradation of the
   electron-rich SDZ and thus reducing its toxicity. Moreover, metabolome
   analysis of wheat roots indicated that low concentrations of Br-
   stimulated the production of indoleacetic acid under SDZ stress,
   promoting growth and enhancing the uptake and degradation of SDZ.
   Conversely, high Br- (1 mM) concentration produced a deleterious effect.
   These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of
   antibiotic removal, suggesting a potentially novel approach to
   plant-based antibiotic remediation.},

Abstract = {Micro/nanoplastics (M/NPs) and phthalates (PAEs) are emerging
   pollutants. Polystyrene (PS) MPs and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are typical
   MPs and PAEs in the environment. However, how dandelion plants respond
   to the combined contamination of MPs and PAEs remains unclear. In this
   study, we evaluated the individual and combined effects of PS NPs (10 mg
   L-1) and DBP (50 mg L-1) on dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) seedlings.
   The results showed that compared to control and individual-treated
   plants, coexposure to PS NPs and DBP signifi-cantly affected plant
   growth, induced oxidative stress, and altered enzymatic and nonenzymatic
   antioxidant levels of dandelion. Similarly, photosynthetic attributes
   and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic parameters were significantly
   affected by coexposure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results
   showed that PS particles had accumulated in the root cortex of the
   dandelion. Metabolic analysis of dandelion showed that single and
   combined exposures caused the plant's metabolic pathways to be
   profoundly reprogrammed. As a consequence, the synthesis and energy
   metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids were
   affected because galactose metabolism, the citric acid cycle, and
   alanine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid metabolism pathways were
   significantly altered. These results provide a new perspective on the
   phytotoxicity and environmental risk assessment of MPs and PAEs in
   individual or coexposures.},

   a variety of SACs, focusing on the understanding of
   structure-performance relationships and key mechanisms involved. First,
   the SACs-promoted COPs dechlorination through the reduction process is
   evaluated. Second, the oxidation process for COPs degradation is
   presented, followed by the discussion of the synergic
   reduc-tion-oxidation degradation process. Last, the existing challenges
   in this field and possible solutions are proposed, hoping to offer
   inspiration and guidance for the future applications of SACs in COPs

Title = {A Review of Advances in Fabrication Methods and Assistive Technologies
   of Micro-Structured Surfaces},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {5},
Month = {APR 26},
Abstract = {Micro-structured surfaces possess excellent properties of friction,
   lubrication, drag reduction, antibacterial, and self-cleaning, which
   have been widely applied in optical, medical, national defense,
   aerospace fields, etc. Therefore, it is requisite to study the
   fabrication methods of micro-structures to improve the accuracy and
   enhance the performance of micro-structures. At present, there are
   plenty of studies focusing on the preparation of micro-structures;
   therefore, systematic review of the technologies and developing trend on
   the fabrication of micro-structures are needed. In present review, the
   fabrication methods of various micro-structures are compared and
   summarized. Specially, the characteristics and applications of
   ultra-precision machining (UPM) technology in the fabrication of
   micro-structures are mainly discussed. Additionally, the assistive
   technologies applied into UPM, such as fast tool servo (FTS) technology
   and slow tool servo (STS) technology to fabricate micro-structures with
   different characteristics are summarized. Finally, the principal
   characteristics and applications of fly cutting technology in
   manufacturing special micro-structures are presented. From the review,
   it is found that by combining different machining methods to prepare the
   base layer surface first and then fabricate the sublayer surface, the
   advantages of different machining technologies can be greatly exerted,
   which is of great significance for the preparation of multi-layer and
   multi-scale micro-structures. Furthermore, the combination of
   ultra-precision fly cutting and FTS/STS possess advantages in realizing
   complex micro-structures with high aspect ratio and high resolution.
   However, residual tool marks and material recovery are still the key
   factors affecting the form accuracy of machined micro-structures. This
   review provides advances in fabrication methods and assistive
   technologies of micro-structured surfaces, which serves as the guidance
   for both fabrication and application of multi-layer and multi-scale
   micro-structures.},

Title = {Microplastic Pollution and Monitoring in Seawater and Harbor
   Environments: A Meta-Analysis and Review},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {15},
Number = {11},
Month = {JUN 4},
Abstract = {Due to its widespread occurrence in practically all environmental
   sectors, including the terrestrial, marine, and atmospheric,
   microplastics (MP) have transitioned from an emerging pollutant to a
   chronic contaminant. Studies on the prevalence and hazardous effects on
   marine creatures have been conducted all over the world, but only in
   coastal environments. Microplastic pollution has emerged as a global
   concern in marine environments and a danger to animals, predators, and
   humans because it has been discovered in the marine environment all over
   the world. This review examines the quantity of MP samples around the
   world and their colonization by marine microorganisms, as well as the
   detection, features, origins, and ecological implications of paint
   fragments and resins in our oceans and ports. These polymers are derived
   from paints and the fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) matrix used in
   shipbuilding. Microplastics should be regarded as coming from synthetic
   polymers found in ship coatings. For assessing microplastic pollution,
   choosing an appropriate sample technique is essential. Additionally,
   this review offers an overview of MP investigation methods,
   concentrating on sampling techniques, laboratory procedures, and the
   identification of MPs found in seawater, as well as assessing how well
   they apply to the seaport environment. Because of the widespread
   discovery of MP pollution, particularly in Africa, Asia, India, South
   Africa, North America, and Europe, it is clear that monitoring is
   crucial for determining the efficacy of mitigation efforts to limit the
   quantity of waste plastic entering the environment, especially through
   sensors and real-time information transfer systems (e.g., smart digital
   seawater monitoring).},

Title = {Microplastics sequestered in the soil affect the turnover and stability
   of soil aggregates: A review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {904},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Plastic products have become ubiquitous in society, and entered various
   ecosystems due to the massive scale of production. The United Nations
   Environment Program (UNEP) has listed microplastics (MPs), which form
   when plastic remnants degrade, as a global emerging pollutant, and the
   association between soil pollution and MPs has become a popular research
   topic. This paper systematically reviews research focusing on MP-related
   soil pollution from the past 10 years (2012-2022), with the identified
   papers demonstrating that interactions be-tween MPs and soil aggregates
   has become a research frontier in the field. The presented research
   provides evidence that soil aggregates are important storage sites for
   MPs, and that storage patterns of MPs within soil aggregates are
   influenced by MP characteristics. In addition, MPs affect the formation,
   turnover, and stability of soil aggregates through the introduction of
   fracture points along with diverse physicochemical characteristics such
   as composition and specific surface area. The current knowledge base
   includes certain issues and challenges that could be addressed in future
   research by extending the spatial and temporal scales over which
   microplastic-soil aggregate interactions are studied, unifying
   quantitative and qualitative methods, and tracing the fates of MPs in
   the soil matrix. This review contributes to enriching our understanding
   of how terrestrial MPs interact with soil aggregates, and whether they
   pose a risk to soil health.},

Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) as an emerging pollutant can affect aquatic
   organisms through physical ingestion, chemical problems and possible
   creation of biological layers on their surfaces in the environment. One
   of the significant ways for MPs to enter the aquatic environment is
   through the effluent discharge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs).
   In this study, first, the concentration and characteristics of MPs in
   secondary wastewater effluent, and the influential variables related to
   the coagulation process, for MPs removal were identified using
   systematic reviews of previous studies. Then, the most proper MPs
   characterization and coagulation variables were chosen by experts'
   opinions using a fuzzy Delphi method. Therefore, the experiment tested
   in conditions close to the full-scale wastewater treatments. Finally, in
   the laboratory removal of MPs by coagulation of polyamide (PA),
   polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene (PE), < 125 and 300-600 mu m in size,
   was tested by a jar test applying Al-2(SO4)(3) in doses of 5 to 100 mg/L
   plus 15 mg/L polyacrylamide as a coagulant aid. Using R and Excel
   software, the results were analyzed statistically. It was concluded that
   the maximum and minimum removal efficiency was 74.7 and 1.39\% for small
   PA and large PE, respectively. Smaller MPs were found to have higher
   removal efficiency. The MPs type PA achieved greater removal efficiency
   than PS, while PE had the least removal efficiency.},

Abstract = {Antibiotics and microplastics (MPs) are two emerging pollutants in
   agroecosystems, however the effects of coexposure to antibiotics and MPs
   remain unclear. The toxicity of florfenicol (FF) and polystyrene
   microplastics (PS-MPs) on rice seedlings was investigated. FF and PS-MPs
   caused colloidal agglomeration, which changed the environmental behavior
   of FF. FF inhibited rice growth and altered antioxidant enzyme
   (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) activities, leading to
   membrane lipid peroxidation; impaired photosynthetic systems, decreased
   photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b, and carotene),
   chlorophyll precursors (Proto IX, Mg-Proto IX, and Pchlide),
   photosynthetic and respiratory rates. The key photosynthesis related
   genes (PsaA, PsaB, PsbA, PsbB, PsbC, and PsbD) were significantly
   down-regulated. The ultrastructure of mesophyll cells was destroyed with
   chloroplast swelling, membrane surface blurring, irregular thylakoid
   lamellar structure, and number of peroxisomes increased. PS-MPs
   mitigated FF toxicity, and the IBR index values showed that 10 mg \&
   BULL;L-1 PS-MPs were more effective. Metabolomic analysis revealed that
   the abundance of metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered by FF,
   was greater than the combined ``MPs-FF{''} contamination. The metabolism
   of amino acids, sugars, and organic acids were severely interfered.
   Among these, 15 metabolic pathways were significantly altered, with the
   most significant effects on phenylalanine metabolism and the citric acid
   cycle (p < 0.05).},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {859},

Month = {FEB 10},
Abstract = {Environmental antibiotics raise serious health concerns due to their
   contribution to the obesity prevalence. Moreover, antibiotics promote
   antibiotic-resistance bacteria (ARB) which represent another emerging
   pollutant. However, the interaction between antibiotic and ARB in the
   obesogenic effects remained unexplored. In the present study, the
   obesogenic effects of tetracycline antibiotic (TCH) and ARB containing
   tetA were studied on C. elegans, and E. coli OP50 (OP50) was referred as
   a normal bacterial food. Results showed that TCH stimulated nematode
   triglyceride contents, while ARB alone had no significant influences.
   The combination of TCH and ARB showed less obesogenic effects than TCH
   alone, showing antagonism. Biochemical assays showed that the
   combination of TCH and ARB showed similar effects to ARB alone, and had
   less increases in lipid metabolism enzymes or metabolites than those of
   TCH or ARB alone, supporting the antagonism. In the nontargeted
   metabolomic analysis, TCH with ARB showed less significantly changed
   metabolites (SCMs) in the nematodes than TCH or ARB alone, partially
   explaining the antagonism. The metabolomic results also pointed out the
   significant involvement of amino acids, the carboxylic acids and
   derivatives, and also the benzene and substituted derivatives in the
   obesogenic effects of TCH and ARB. The findings of the present study
   provided a direct support for interaction between antibiotics and ARB
   underlying their health risks.},

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {315},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Carbamazepine (CBZ) as an extensively distributed emerging pollutant has
   menaced ecological security. The degradation performance of CBZ by UV
   driven bisulfite process was investigated in this work. The kinetics
   results indicated that CBZ was high-efficiently degraded by UV/bisulfite
   following a pseudo first-order kinetic model (K-obs = 0.0925 min(-1)).
   SO4 center dot- and center dot OH were verified as the reactive oxidants
   by EPR test and the radicals scavenging experiment using MeOH and TBA.
   SO4 center dot- played a dominant role for CBZ degradation. The Density
   functional theory (DFT) and LC-qTOF-MS/MS clarified that hydroxylation,
   ketonation, ring opening reaction, and ring contraction were main
   transformation patterns of CBZ. As to influence factors, CBZ degradation
   was significantly hindered in presence of CO32-, HPO42- and NOM.
   Toxicological analysis derived from metabonomics suggested that the
   remarkable alteration of metabolic profile was triggered by exposure to
   intermediates mixture. CBZ intermediates interfered in several key
   metabolic pathways, including pentose phosphate, amino acids, lysine
   degradation, glycerophospholipid, glutathione, nucleotides and
   carbohydrate, which was alleviated after UV/bisulfite treatment. This
   work provided a meaningful support to potential risk of CBZ
   intermediates products, which shed light on the future application in
   eliminating drugs using UV /bisulfite.},

Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {As an emerging pollutant, microplastics have attracted widespread
   concern around the world. Research on microplastics was first conducted
   in oceans, and in recent years, inland water, especially lakes, has
   gradually become a hot spot. This paper systematically reviews the
   sampling, separation, purification, and identification technologies used
   to assess microplastics in lakes and summarizes the occurrence of lake
   microplastics worldwide. The results show that microplastics are
   widespread in lake water and sediment. There are obvious geographical
   differences in the occurrence of microplastics. The abundance of
   microplastics in different lakes varies greatly. The forms are mostly
   fibrous and fragments, and the main polymers are polypropylene (PP) and
   polyethylene (PE). Previous papers have failed to comment in as much
   detail on the microplastic sampling techniques employed within lake
   systems. The sampling and analysis methods are critical to accurately
   evaluating contamination results. Due to the widespread presence of
   microplastics and the lack of uniform standards, there are various
   sampling methods. Trawls and grabs are most widely used in the sampling
   of lake water bodies and sediment, and sodium chloride and hydrogen
   peroxide are the most widely used media for flotation and digestion,
   respectively. In the future, it will be critical to establish unified
   standards for lake microplastic sampling and analysis technology,
   further explore the migration mechanism of microplastics in lake
   systems, and pay attention to the impact of microplastics on lake
   ecosystems.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN VETERINARY SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {JUN 30},
Abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria is one of the preeminent
   concerns for the future of global health. There is a dose-dependent
   relationship between antimicrobial use (AMU) and the prevalence of
   antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. As most AMU in Canada is related to
   animal agriculture, there is a need to reduce overall AMU, which could
   be accomplished through surveillance of AMU in animal agriculture,
   including the dairy industry. The objective of this study was to
   quantify AMU on dairy farms across Canada. This study had two parts: a
   description of data collected in 2019-2020, and a meta-analysis
   comparing this data to previous estimates of AMU in the Canadian dairy
   industry. The first included a garbage can audit (GCA) on 107 farms in
   four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Nova
   Scotia) in 2020; AMU data were converted to the dose-based metrics of
   defined course doses (DCD) and defined daily doses (DDD). Mixed-effect
   linear models were fit to determine the relationship between province
   and use of different classes of antimicrobials. On average, for every
   100 animals on the farm, 117 DCD of antimicrobials were administered per
   year (IQR: 55, 158). These treatments amounted to 623 DDD / 100
   animal-yr (IQR: 302, 677 DDD/100 animal-years). Penicillins were the
   most used class of antimicrobials, followed by first-and
   third-generation cephalosporins. Farms in Ontario used more
   third-generation cephalosporins than other provinces. The second part of
   this study compared AMU in 2020 to previously reported Canadian studies
   through a meta-analysis. A GCA was conducted in 2007-2008 in Alberta,
   Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime provinces (Prince Edward Island, New
   Brunswick and Nova Scotia); another GCA was conducted in Quebec in 2018.
   Overall, AMU was lower in 2018-2020 than in 2007-2008, with the
   exception of third-generation cephalosporin use, which increased.},

Abstract = {Background: Esophageal cancer (EC) is the 6th leading cause of
   cancer-related deaths worldwide, and the morbidity and mortality of EC
   have continued to increase in recent years. The results of the clinical
   application of the Fast-track recovery surgery (FTS) concept in nursing
   interventions for EC patients after total endoscopic esophagectomy are
   unconvincing. This study sought to evaluate the nursing effect of the
   fast-track recovery surgical nursing model on patients with EC after
   total cavity endoscopic esophagectomy. Methods: We searched for articles
   on case-control trials about nursing interventions after total
   endoscopic esophagectomy. The search time was set from January 2010 to
   May 2022. The data were independently extracted by 2 researchers.
   RevMan5.3 statistical software (Cochrane) was used to analyze the
   extracted data. All the articles included in the review were assessed
   for risk of bias using the Cochrane Handbook 5.3 (https:// Results:
   Ultimately, 8 clinical controlled trials, comprising 613 cases, were
   identified. A meta-analysis was conducted of the extubation times, and
   the results showed that the study group's extubation times were
   remarkably shorter. In relation to the exhaust times, the study group
   had significantly shorter exhaust times than control group (P<0.05). In
   relation to the time, it took patients to leave bed, patients in the
   study group left bed in a considerably shorter time compared with
   controls (P<0.00001). In relation to the hospitalization time, a
   remarkable reduction in the length of hospital stay was observed in the
   study group (P<0.00001). The analysis of the funnel plots showed a small
   number of asymmetries, suggesting that the number of articles included
   was small due to the heterogeneity of the studies (P<0.00001).
   Conclusions: Fast-track recovery surgery (FTS) care is effective at
   accelerating patients' postoperative recovery. This model of care needs
   to be further validated in the future by higher-quality and longer
   followup studies.},

Title = {Coexistence of microplastics alters the inhibitory effect of antibiotics
   on sludge anaerobic digestion},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {455},
Number = {2},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Microplastics and antibiotics are emerging pollutants that inevitably
   enter the sludge anaerobic digestion system. Current studies mainly
   focused on the individual effects of microplastics or antibiotics on
   methane generation. However, there may also be complex reactions between
   them and their combine effects on anaerobic digestion remain unclear.
   This study revealed the combined influencing mechanism of polyamide and
   ofloxacin through batch and semi-continuous tests. Brief exposure to
   ofloxacin was detrimental to methane production. The coexistence of
   polyamide enabled partial adsorption of ofloxacin, which effectively
   mitigates the inhibitory effect of ofloxacin at low concentrations.
   Polyamide also facilitated the colonization of hydrolytic bacteria and
   acidogens, such as Hydrogenispora, and promoted the conversion of
   organic matter to acetate. However, polyamide could not effectively
   alleviate the inhibitory effect of excess ofloxacin on anaerobic
   digestion. Ofloxacin at high concentrations stimulated the release of
   humic acid, reduced methane production by more than 80\%, and changed
   the predominant methanogenesis pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis
   to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Acidogenesis and methanogenesis
   pathways were restructured to further explore the effect of ofloxacin on
   the metabolic potentials of microorganisms. Metagenomic analysis
   revealed that most of functional genes associated with glycolysis, amino
   acid metabolism and methanogenesis were down regulated under longterm
   stress of high concentration of ofloxacin. This study elucidated the
   microbial process of organic matter conversion inhibition by ofloxacin,
   shed light on the combined effects of polyamide and ofloxacin on
   anaerobic digestion and provided new insights for assessing the impact
   of multiple pollutants on the safe disposal of sludge.},

Title = {The Emergence of Antibiotics Resistance Genes, Bacteria, and
   Micropollutants in Grey Wastewater},
Journal = {APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {4},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {The reuse of household greywater is increasing globally. Wastewater and
   greywater treatment processes are not fully effective in removing all
   contaminants, such as emerging micropollutants, antimicrobial-resistant
   bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes. The dynamics between emerging
   micropollutants and antibiotic resistance genes in greywater treatment
   systems are complex. Thus, this review aims to analyze the current
   knowledge on sources, spread, and the fate of emerging micropollutants,
   antibiotic-resistance genes, and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in
   microbial communities of greywater and downstream recipients. The fate
   of antimicrobial resistance and emerging micropollutants from greywater
   in the environment has not been determined. More studies are needed to
   identify the mechanism/s involved in the degradation of emerging
   micropollutants and the presence of transformation pathways in the
   microbial metagenome. In the review, we aim to describe the link between
   the persistence of emerging micropollutants and the emergence of
   antimicrobial resistance. We showed that the effect of irrigation with
   treated wastewater was variable. In addition, we tried to summarize the
   impact of emerging micropollutants on bacteria and their fate in the
   soil microbiome, demonstrating that emerging micropollutants induce
   changes in the diversity of soil bacteria. The fate and transport of
   emerging micropollutants, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, and
   antibiotic resistance genes can vary with soil properties. It is,
   therefore, necessary to better understand how widely
   antibiotic-resistance genes are disseminated.},

Title = {Linkages of volatile fatty acids and polyhexamethylene guanidine stress
   during sludge fermentation: Metagenomic insights of microbial metabolic
   traits and adaptation},
Journal = {CHINESE CHEMICAL LETTERS},
Year = {2023},

Month = {JUN},
Abstract = {The massive use of polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG), as a typical
   bactericidal agent, raised environmental concerns to the public. This
   work comprehensively revealed the hormesis effects of PHMG occurred in
   waste activated sludge (WAS) on the generation of volatile fatty acids
   (VFAs) during anaerobic fermentation. The low level of PHMG (100 mg/g
   TSS) significantly promoted the VFAs generation (1283 mg COD/L, compared
   with 337 mg COD/L in the control) via synchronously facilitating the
   solubilization, hydrolysis, and acidification steps but inhibiting
   methanogenesis. Metagenomic analysis showed that the functional anaerobe
   ( i.e., Bacteroides, Macellibacteroide and Parabacteroide) and
   corresponding genetic expressions responsible for extracellular
   hydrolysis (i.e., clpP), membrane transport (i.e., ffh and gspF),
   intracellular substrates metabolism (i.e., ald and paaF) and VFAs
   biosynthesis (i.e., ACACA and FASN) were enhanced in the optimal
   presence of PHMG. Moreover, the anaerobic species could respond and
   adapt to low PHMG stimuli via quorum sensing (i.e., cqsA, rpfC and
   rpfG), and thus maintain the high microbial metabolic activities.
   However, they were unable to tolerate the toxicity of excessive PHMG,
   resulting in the extremely low VFAs production. This work enlightened
   the effects of emerging pollutants on WAS fermentation at the genetic
   levels, and provided guidance on the WAS treatment and resource
   recovery. (c) 2023 Published by Elsevier B.V. on behalf of Chinese

Title = {Multi-omic profiling of a novel activated sludge strain<i>
   Sphingobacterium</i> sp. WM1 reveals the mechanism of tetracycline
   biodegradation and its merits of potential application},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {243},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {As an emerging pollutant, the antibiotic tetracycline (TC) has been
   consistently detected in wastewater and activated sludge. Biodegradation
   represents a potentially crucial pathway to dissipate TC contamination.
   However, few efficient TC-degrading bacteria have been isolated and a
   comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TC
   degradation is still lacking. In this study, a novel TC-degrading
   bacterium, designated as Sphingobacterium sp. WM1, was successfully
   isolated from activated sludge. Strain WM1 exhibited a remarkable
   performance in degrading 50 mg/L TC within 1 day under co-metabolic
   conditions. Genomic analysis of the strain WM1 unveiled the presence of
   three functional tetX genes. Unraveling the complex molecular
   mechanisms, transcriptome analysis highlighted the role of upregulated
   transmembrane transport and acceler-ated electron transport in
   facilitating TC degradation. Proteomics confirmed the up-regulation of
   proteins involved in cellular biosynthesis/metabolism and ribosomal
   processes. Crucially, the tetX gene-encoding protein showed a
   significant upregulation, indicating its role in TC degradation.
   Heterologous expression of the tetX gene resulted in TC dissipation from
   an initial 51.9 mg/L to 4.2 mg/L within 24 h. The degradation pathway
   encompassed TC hydroxylation, transforming into TP461 and subsequent
   metabolites, which effectively depleted TC's inhibitory activity.
   Notably, the tetX genes in strain WM1 showed limited potential for
   horizontal gene transfer. Collectively, strain WM1 \& PRIME;s potent TC
   degradation capacity signals a promise for enhancing TC clean-up
   strategies.},

   biomass},
Journal = {DESALINATION AND WATER TREATMENT},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {278},
Pages = {169-181},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Due to its high use, amoxicillin (AMX) contributes in a large measure to
   the pollution of aquatic envi-ronment. Unfortunately this emerging
   pollutant has not been covered by the release standards. There is little
   information regarding the AMX effect on heterotrophic biomass of the
   wastewater treatment plant (WWTP), which are not designed to degrade
   them, causing possible dysfunction. The novelty in this study is the
   application of LFS respirometer as a fast, efficient and robust means to
   evaluate the AMX effect on heterotrophs response, allowing the
   determination of inhibition rates by simu-lating the biological
   processes taking place in conventional WWTP. Three types of activated
   sludge and an easily biodegradable synthetic substrate based on sodium
   acetate at 300 mgCOD/L considering the ratio S0/X0 = 0.04 gCOD/gVSS,
   were used. Respirometry showed quite different and low inhibition rates
   of heterotrophic where the maximum reduction in YO/S rate was 30.6\%,
   22\% and 20\% for 75, 120 and 150 mgAMX/L, respectively explaining that
   the heterotrophic biomass adapted to the substrate and to AMX showed a
   fairly significant resistance to inhibition compared to non-acclimated
   one. Heterotrophs biomasses are less sensitive and quick to adapt
   because they were inhibited by 35\% at 150 mgAMX/L, on other, biomass
   contained autotrophes, which were inhibited up to 35\% in 25 mgAMX/L.},

Abstract = {Hydrogenation of CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels not only
   effectively alleviates climate change but also reduces over-dependence
   on fossil fuels. Therefore, much attention has been paid to the chemical
   conversion of CO2 to value-added products, such as liquid fuels and

   challenge of the chemical inertness of CO2 and the difficulty of C-C
   coupling. Considering the lack of a detailed summary on hydrogenation of
   CO2 to liquid fuels and aromatics via the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis
   (FTS) route, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic review of the
   research progress on the development of efficient catalysts for
   hydrogenation of CO2 to liquid fuels and aromatics. In this work, we
   summarized the factors influencing the catalytic activity and stability
   of various catalysts, the strategies for optimizing catalytic
   performance and product distribution, the effects of reaction conditions
   on catalytic performance, and possible reaction mechanisms for CO2
   hydrogenation via the FTS route. Furthermore, we also provided an

Title = {BDE-209 exposure in murine melanoma (B16-F1) cells modulates tumor

Journal = {FOOD AND CHEMICAL TOXICOLOGY},

Abstract = {Melanoma is a type of skin cancer considered aggressive due to its high
   metastatic ability and rapid progression to other tissues and organs.
   BDE-209 (2,2 `,3,3 `,4,4 `,5,5 `,6,6 `-decabromodiphenyl ether) is an
   additive used as a flame retardant and classified as a persistent
   organic pollutant that has a high bioaccumulation capacity due to its
   lipophilic nature. This substance has already been detected in rivers,
   air, soil, plants and even in different human biological samples, such
   as plasma, umbilical cord blood and breast milk, revealing a great
   concern to human populations. Thus, in the current study we investigated
   whether prior exposure of murine melanoma B16-F1 cells to BDE-209
   modulates in vivo progression and malignancy of melanoma. B16-F1 cells
   were cultured and exposed in vitro to BDE-209 (0.01, 0.1 e 1 nM) for 15
   days and then inoculated, via caudal vein, in C57BL/6 mice for
   experimental metastasis analysis after 20 days. Inoculation of
   BDE-209-exposed cells resulted in 82\% increase of metastasis colonized
   area in the lungs of mice, downregulation of tumor suppressors genes,
   such as Timp3 and Reck, decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of
   systemic and local inflammatory response. These findings are related to
   melanoma progression. Additionally, the histopathological analysis
   revealed greater number of focal points of metastases in the lungs and
   invasiveness of metastases to the mice brain (89\%). The results showed
   that exposure to BDE-209 may alter the phenotype of B16-F1 cells,
   worsening their metastatic profile. Current data showed that BDE-209 may
   interfere with the prognosis of melanoma by modulating cells with less
   invasiveness capacity to a more aggressive profile.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {183},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Cardiometabolic disorders (CMD) are a growing public health problem
   across the world. Among the known cardiometabolic risk factors are
   compounds that induce endocrine and metabolic dysfunctions, such as
   endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). To date, how EDCs influence
   molecular programs and cardiometabolic risks has yet to be fully
   elucidated, especially considering the complexity contributed by
   species-, chemical-, and dose-specific effects. Moreover, different
   experimental and analytical methodologies employed by different studies
   pose challenges when comparing findings across studies. To explore the
   molecular mechanisms of EDCs in a systematic manner, we established a
   data-driven computational approach to meta-analyze 30 human, mouse, and
   rat liver transcriptomic datasets for 4 EDCs, namely bisphenol A (BPA),
   bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), tributyltin (TBT), and
   perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Our computational pipeline uniformly
   re-analyzed preprocessed quality-controlled microarray data and raw
   RNAseq data, derived differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and
   biological pathways, modeled gene regulatory networks and regulators,
   and determined CMD associations based on gene overlap analysis. Our
   approach revealed that DEHP and PFOA shared stable transcriptomic
   signatures that are enriched for genes associated with CMDs, suggesting
   similar mechanisms of action such as perturbations of peroxisome
   proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) signaling and liver
   gene network regulators VNN1 and ACOT2. In contrast, TBT exhibited
   highly divergent gene signatures, pathways, network regulators, and
   disease associations from the other EDCs. In addition, we found that the
   rat, mouse, and human BPA studies showed highly variable transcriptomic
   patterns, providing molecular support for the variability in BPA
   responses. Our work offers insights into the commonality and differences
   in the molecular mechanisms of various EDCs and establishes a
   streamlined data-driven workflow to compare molecular mechanisms of
   environmental substances to elucidate the underlying connections between
   chemical exposure and disease risks.},

Abstract = {Microplastics, defined as particles <5 mm in diameter, are emerging
   environmental pollutants that pose a threat to ecosystems and human
   health. Biofilm degradation of microplastics maybe an ecologically
   friendly approach. This review systematically summarises the factors
   affecting biofilm degradation of microplastics and proposes feasible
   methods to improve the efficiency of microplastic biofilm degradation.
   Environmentally insensitive microorganisms were screened, optimized, and
   commercially cultured to facilitate the practical application of this
   technology. For strain screening, technology should focus on
   microorganisms/strains that can modify the hydrophobicity of
   microplastics, degrade the crystalline zone of microplastics, and
   metabolise additives in microplastics. The biodegradation mechanism is
   also described; microorganisms secreting extracellular oxidases and
   hydrolases are key factors for degradation. Measuring the changes in
   molecular weight distribution (MWD) enables better analysis of the
   biodegradation behaviour of microplastics. Biofilm degradation of
   microplastics has relatively few applications because of its low
   efficiency; however, enrichment of microplastics in freshwater
   environments and wastewater treatment plant tailwater is currently the
   most effective method for treating microplastics with biofilms.},

Abstract = {Plants play a vital role in the phytoremediation process, attenuating
   various pollutants. However, the dynamic root uptake and fate of
   emerging pollutants in plants, along with their effects on plant
   characteristics, have received limited research attention. This study
   explores the potential of Chrysopogon zizanioides (Vetiver) and
   Colocasia esculenta (Taro) in mitigating pharmaceutical and personal
   care products (PPCPs)- metronidazole (MNZ), naproxen (NAP), and
   methylparaben (MeP), under hydroponic conditions. Both plants
   demonstrated similar specific uptake potentials for the target
   pollutants (5.23 to 5.76 mg/g of biomass dry weight), with pollutant
   accumulation in plants remaining very low (<10 \%). Notably, a
   substantial fraction of pollutants (66.27 \% to 78.42 \%) underwent
   metabolism. Qualitative analysis identified five MNZ and NAP metabolites
   and six MeP metabolites in plant tissues. Over a 28-day PPCPs exposure,
   accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulted in reduced
   chlorophyll content, root activity, protein, and carbohydrates,
   alongside increased oxidative stress levels. The study highlighted
   distinct accumulation patterns, with NAP (anion) primarily in roots and
   MeP (cation) and MNZ (neutral) predominantly in aerial parts.
   Phloroglucinol staining confirmed the intact endodermis (Casparian
   Strips) in Vetiver roots, indicating symplastic transport of PPCPs to
   aerial parts. Moreover, significant morphological alterations were
   observed in plant roots exposed to target pollutants. During
   recuperation, a decrease in accumulated ROS indicates partial
   self-recovery from oxidative damage. In conclusion, both Vetiver and
   Taro emerge as promising candidates for removing specified PPCPs,
   emphasizing the critical role of addressing emerging contaminants for
   sustainable development and preserving the environment and human
   wellbeing.},

Title = {Bibliometric analysis of Advanced Oxidation Processes studies with a
   focus on Life Cycle Assessment and Costs},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 2},
Abstract = {Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are wastewater treatment
   technologies that stand out for their ability to degrade Contaminants of
   Emerging Concern (CECs). The literature has extensively investigated
   these removal processes for different aqueous matrices. Once technically
   mature, some of these systems have become accredited to be applied on a
   large scale, and therefore, their systemic performances in the
   environmental and cost spheres have also become essential requirements.
   This study proposed corroborating this trend, analyzing the available
   literature on the subject to verify how experts in the AOP area
   investigated this integration during 2015-2023. For this purpose, a
   sample of publications was treated by applying the Systematic Review
   (SR) methodology. This resulted in an extract of 83 studies that adopted
   life-cycle logic to estimate environmental impacts and process costs or
   evaluated them as complementary to the technical dimension of each
   treatment technology. This analysis found that both dimensions can be
   used for selecting or sizing AOPs at the design scale. However, the
   appropriate choice of the impact categories for the environmental
   assessment and establishing a methodology for cost analysis can make the
   approach still more effective. In addition, a staggering number of
   processes would broaden the reality and applicability of the estimates,
   and adopting multicriteria analysis methodologies could address
   essential aspects of decision-making processes during the design of the
   arrangements. By meeting the original purposes, the study broadened the
   requirements for designing AOPs and disseminating their use in
   mitigating the discharge of CECs.},

Title = {Microplastics in coastal blue carbon ecosystems: A global Meta-analysis
   of its distribution, driving mechanisms, and potential risks},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {878},
Month = {JUN 20},
Abstract = {Microplastics, as emerging pollutants, have become a global
   environmental concern. Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) are threatened by
   microplastics. Although substantial studies have explored the dynamics
   and threats of microplastics in BCEs, the fate and driving factors of
   microplastics in BCEs on a global scale remain largely unknown. Here,
   the occurrence, driving factors, and risks of microplastics in global
   BCEs were investigated by synthesizing a global metaanalysis. The
   results showed that the abundance of microplastics in BCEs has notable
   spatial differences worldwide, with the highest microplastic
   concentrations in Asia, especially in South and Southeast Asia.
   Microplastic abundance is influenced by the vegetation habitat, climate,
   coastal environment, and river runoff. The interaction of geographic
   location, ecosystem type, coastal environment, and climate enhanced the
   effects of microplastic distribution. In addition, we found that
   microplastic accumulation in organisms varied according to feeding
   habits and body weight. Significant accumulation was observed in large
   fish; however, growth dilution effects were also observed. The effect of
   microplastics on the organic carbon content of sediments from BCEs
   varies by ecosystem; microplastic concentrations do not necessarily
   increase organic carbon sequestration. Global BCEs are at a high risk of
   microplastic pollution, with high microplastic abundance and toxicity
   driving the high pollution risk. Finally, this review provides
   scientific evidence that will form the basis for future microplastic
   research, focusing on the transport of microplastics in BCEs; effects on
   the growth, development, and primary productivity of blue carbon plants;
   and soil biogeochemical cycles.},

Title = {Perturbation and mechanism of non-antibiotic drug in regulating
   resistome and metabolome of anammox consortia: An overlooked and
   underrated cause of multiresistance},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {475},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {Given that antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) become emerging
   pollutants, their accumulation and transfer caused by extensive use of
   antibiotic and non-antibiotic drugs raise concerns. In contrast, the
   impacts of nonantibiotic drugs have been largely overlooked, and their
   regulation mechanism in anammox system remains unclear. In this study,
   the single and combined effects of typical antibiotic (doxycycline) and
   non-antibiotic drug (propranolol) on anammox consortia were evaluated
   and compared from process performance, community succession, metabolic
   and gene regulation perspectives. Significant reduction in the nitrogen
   removal efficiency (49.0 +/- 0.5\%) was only observed in the anammox
   process stressed by propranolol and doxycycline, but it was reversible.
   Metabolome results showed that anammox consortia upregulated amino acid
   metabolism under propranolol stress, while the abundance of pyrimidine
   and purine metabolic pathways significantly increased under doxycycline
   and multidrug stress. Microorganisms adapted to these stresses by
   changing the utilization preference for metabolites. Metagenomic
   analyses indicated that doxycycline and propranolol induced the high
   frequency of gene transfer through increasing oxidative stress level,
   membrane permeability, pili and efflux pumps. Significant correlations
   between ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), especially intI1,
   demonstrated the conjugative transfer of ARGs. Furthermore, structural
   equation models showed that microbial community, bacterial metabolism,
   MGEs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and corresponding SOS response were
   key driving factors for ARGs transfer in the anammox systems. These
   findings fill the gap in the effect of nonantibiotic drugs on anammox
   system and their regulation mechanism, which further provides a
   theoretical guidance for anammox-based process to treat
   multidrug-containing wastewater.},

Title = {Comparison of developmental toxicity of benzophenone-3 and its
   metabolite benzophenone-8 in zebrafish},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {258},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) as one of frequently used organic UV filters has
   been considered an emerging pollutant due to its toxicities.
   Benzophenone-8 (BP-8) is one of the main metabolites of BP-3 in
   organisms. Current reports show that BP-8 may be more toxic than BP-3.
   However, difference of their toxicities on embryonic development has
   rarely been reported. In this study, zebrafish embryos were chosen as
   the target organism to explore the developmental toxicities of BP-3 and
   BP-8. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis was performed to compare their
   modes of action. Results showed that BP-8 exposures led to higher
   bioaccumulation and lower hatching rate of zebrafish larvae than BP-3.
   Both BP-8 and BP-3 exposures caused behavioral abnormalities of
   zebrafish larvae, but no significant difference was found between them.
   At the metabolome level, 1 mu g/L BP-3 and 1 mu g/L BP-8 exposures
   altered neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and FoxO
   signaling pathway, respectively, which might be involved in the abnormal
   behaviors in zebrafish larvae. For higher exposure groups (30 and 300 mu
   g/L), both BP-3 and BP-8 exposures changed metabolism of cofactors and
   vitamins of zebrafish larvae. Exposure of BP-3 altered the metabolism by
   pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway, while BP-8 exposure changed
   riboflavin metabolism and folate biosynthesis. The above results
   indicated different modes of action of BP-3 and BP-8 in zebrafish
   embryonic development. This study sheds new light to biological hazards
   of BP-3 due to its metabolism in aquatic organisms.},

Title = {Theoretical design of transition metal-doped oxo-triarylmethyl as a
   disposable platform for adsorption of ibuprofen},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF MOLECULAR GRAPHICS \& MODELLING},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {126},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Emerging environmental contaminants have become a crucial environmental
   issue because of the highly toxic effluents emitted by factories.
   Ibuprofen (IBP), as a typical anti-inflammatory drug, is frequently
   detected in water sources. Therefore, its removal using various
   adsorbents has drawn great interest. Herein, the structural, electronic,
   energetic, and optical properties of pristine oxo-triarylmethyl (oxTAM)
   and transition metal-doped oxo-triarylmethyl (TM@oxTAM, TM = Sc, Ti, V,
   Cr, and Mn) for adsorption of the IBU drug were investigated using
   density functional theory (DFT) calculations implemented in Gaussian and
   VASP codes. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO), density of states (DOS),
   and electronic band structure results demonstrated that transition
   metaldoped oxTAM causes a significant reduction in the energy band gap
   (Eg) value of pristine oxTAM, with the highest decrease (30.14 \%) in
   the case of Mn@oxTAM. It was found that transition metal doping onto
   oxTAM leads to an increase in the adsorption energies (1.20-2.64 eV) and
   charge density between transition metal and IBU. Natural bond orbital
   (NBO) analysis revealed that charge was effectively transferred from the
   IBU towards the transition metal, which was further analyzed by charge
   decomposition analysis (CDA). Furthermore, quantum theory of atoms in
   molecules (QTAIM), interaction region indicator (IRI), electron
   localization function (ELF), and radial distribution function (RDF)
   analyses revealed that the IBU is adsorbed on the Sc@oxTAM surface via
   covalent interactions, while electrostatic with partially covalent
   interactions are dominated in other IBU/TM@oxTAM complexes. The results
   suggest that TM doping on the oxTAM provides a new insight for
   developing photocatalyst-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to
   remove emerging pollutants in wastewater.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {205},

Month = {AUG 20},
Abstract = {Ferroptosis has been suggested to involve in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced
   cardiotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms and regulatory
   targets of cardiomyocyte ferroptosis remains to be understood. This
   study demonstrated that the up-regulation of ferroptosis associated
   proteins genes were accompanied with the down-regulation of AMPKa2
   phosphorylation in DOX treated mouse heart or neonatal rat
   cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). AMPKa2 knockout (AMPKa2-/-) significantly
   exacerbated mouse cardiac dysfunction, increased mortality, promoting
   ferroptosis associated mitochondrial injuries, enhanced ferroptosis
   associated proteins and genes expression, and lead to accumulation of
   lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mouse serum and
   hearts respectively. Ferrostatin-1 administration markedly improved
   cardiac function, decreased mortality, inhibited mitochondrial injuries
   and ferroptosis associated proteins and genes expression, and depressed
   accumulation of LDH and MDA in DOX treated AMPKa2- /-mouse. Moreover,
   Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 AMPKa2 (AAV9-AMPKa2) or AICAR
   treatment mediated AMPKa2 activation could significantly improve cardiac
   function and depress ferroptosis in mouse. AMPKa2 activation or silence
   could also inhibit or promote ferroptosis associated injuries in DOX
   treated NRCMs respecitively. Mechanistically, AMPKa2/ACC mediated lipid
   metabolism has been suggested to involve in regulating DOX-treatment
   induced ferroptosis other than mTORC1 or autophagy dependent pathway.
   The metabolomics analysis exhibited that AMPKa2- /-significantly
   enhanced accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFAs), oxidized
   lipid, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Finally, this study also
   demonstrated that metformin (MET) treatment could inhibit ferroptosis
   and improve cardiac function via activating AMPKa2 phosphorylation. The
   metabolomics analysis exhibited that MET treatment significantly
   depressed PFAs accumulation in DOX treated mouse hearts. Collectively,
   this study suggested that AMPKa2 activation might protect against
   anthracycline chemotherapeutic drugs mediated cardiotoxicity via
   inhibiting ferroptosis.},

   (Musca</i><i> domestica):</i> A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {PARASITE EPIDEMIOLOGY AND CONTROL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Introduction: Although house flies (Musca domestica) do not directly
   cause disease in humans, they transmit pathogens to them, which provide
   the basis for many diseases. The main way to deal with this insect is to
   use insecticides. Due to the resistance from insecticides, the fight
   against house flies has been hampered. This study aimed to determine the
   prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides
   in house flies worldwide.Methods: This study was conducted via a
   systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of
   knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies.
   Accord-ingly, by searching the databases of Web of Science, PubMed,
   Scopus, Proquest, Bioone, and Embase, all published articles were
   extracted, and reviewed until the end of May 2022. Statistical data
   analysis was performed using the random-effects model in the
   meta-analysis, meta -regres-sion, and I2 index.Results: Nine studies
   entered the meta-analysis process. Based on this, the prevalence of
   knock-down resistance against organochlorine insecticide in house flies
   was estimated to be 49.1\%. Meta-regression showed that the prevalence
   of knockdown resistance increased with increasing years of study but
   decreased with increasing sample size. Conclusion: According to the
   findings, about 50\% of house flies have knockdown resistance against
   organochlorine insecticide. As a result, it is necessary to adopt
   effective and combined methods to combat this insect to control it and
   prevent the transmission of diseases caused by it.},

Abstract = {Water quality has recently emerged as one of the utmost severe
   ecological problems being faced by the developing countries all over the
   world, and Bangladesh is no exception. Both surface and groundwater
   sources contain different contaminants, which lead to numerous deaths
   due to water-borne diseases, particularly among children. This study
   presents one of the most comprehensive reviews on the current status of
   water quality in Bangladesh with a special emphasis on both conventional
   pollutants and emerging contaminants. Data show that urban rivers in
   Bangladesh are in a critical condition, especially Korotoa, Teesta,
   Rupsha, Pashur, and Padma. The Buriganga River and few locations in the
   Turag, Balu, Sitalakhya, and Karnaphuli rivers have dissolvable oxygen
   (DO) levels of almost zero. Many waterways contain traces of NO3, NO2,
   and PO4-3 pollutants. The majority of the rivers in Bangladesh also have
   Zn, Cu, Fe, Pb, Cd, Ni, Mn, As, and Cr concentrations that exceed the
   WHO permissible limits for safe drinking water, while their metal
   concentrations exceed the safety threshold for irrigation. Mercury poses
   the greatest hazard with 90.91\% of the samples falling into the highest
   risk category. Mercury is followed by zinc 57.53\% and copper 29.16\% in
   terms of the dangers they pose to public health and the ecosystem.
   Results show that a considerable percentage of the population is at
   risk, being exposed to contaminated water. Despite hundreds of
   cryptosporidiosis cases reported, fecal contamination, i.e.,
   Cryptosporidium, is totally ignored and need serious considerations to
   be regularly monitored in source water.},

Volume = {106},
Number = {5, SI},
Pages = {1149-1176},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Pollution is one of the most relevant issues for the conservation of
   freshwater environments. Fishes are the main group of organisms studied
   in aquatic toxicology, and their behaviours, including feeding,
   courtship, parental care, and territoriality, are essential to their
   health. Cichlids are one of the most abundant fish families and are both
   economically and ecologically relevant. In this review, we found that
   metals, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and endocrine disruptor
   chemicals are the main groups of pollutants that have been studied in
   the context of cichlid behaviour. African tilapias are the most
   evaluated cichlids on this topic, and Nile tilapia was the most
   frequently studied species. Exposure to these pollutants has been shown
   to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming,
   activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface
   of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction.
   Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances,
   and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms
   underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set
   of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of
   cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods. It is also
   important to consider more pollutants-both individually and in
   combination-such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants such as
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and
   microplastics, due the increasing relevance of these pollutants of
   emerging concern. In line with this, cichlid fish species with reduced
   native distributions are suitable study species to provide information
   for the conservation of freshwater environments.},

   water and sediment, contributing to ARGs, posing a threat to both fish
   and human health. Research gaps persist in the removal of MPs, efficient
   heavy metals control, and addressing antibiotics and ARGs pollution in

Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are organic chemical substances

Title = {Metagenomic analysis reveals the dissemination mechanisms and risks of
   resistance genes in plateau lakes},
Journal = {ISCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {26},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 15},
Abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging as environmental
   pollutants that can persist and disseminate in aquatic environments.
   Lakes, as important sources of freshwater, also serve as potential
   natural reservoirs of ARGs. In this study, we analyzed the distribution
   and potential risks of resistance genes in five typical freshwater lakes
   on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Our findings revealed that multidrug and
   MLS ARGs dominated in the studied lakes. Notably, while Lugu Lake
   exhibited higher abundance of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and
   metal resistance genes (MRGs), a greater resistome risk was observed in
   the eutrophic Xingyun Lake. The dissemination processes of ARGs and MRGs
   are primarily driven by microbial communities and the horizontal gene
   transfer via MGEs. Limnohabitans, Flavobacterium, and Acinetobacter were
   identified as key players in the dissemination of ARGs. Our study
   highlights the persistence of ARGs and provides valuable baseline data
   and risk assessment of ARGs in plateau freshwater lakes.},

Abstract = {Study DesignSystematic reviewObjectiveExamine the clinical evidence for
   the use of osteobiologics in hybrid surgery (combined anterior cervical
   discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and total disc replacement (TDR)) in
   patients with multilevel cervical degenerative disc disease
   (DDD).MethodsPubMed and Embase were searched between January 2000 and
   August 2020. Clinical studies investigating 18-80 year old patients with
   multilevel cervical DDD who underwent hybrid surgery with or without the
   use of osteobiologics were considered eligible. Two reviewers
   independently screened and assessed the identified articles. The
   methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) tool and the
   risk of bias (RoB 2.0) assessment tool were used to assess risk of bias.
   The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations
   (GRADE) was used to evaluate quality of evidence across studies per
   outcome.ResultsEleven studies were included. A decrease in cervical
   range of motion was observed in most studies for both the hybrid surgery
   and the control groups consisting of stand-alone ACDF or TDR. Fusion
   rates of 70-100\% were reported in both the hybrid surgery and control
   groups consisting of stand-alone ACDF. The hybrid surgery group
   performed better or comparable to the control group in terms of adjacent
   segment degeneration. Studies reported an improvement in visual analogue
   scale for pain and neck disability index values after surgery compared
   to preoperative scores for both treatment groups. The included studies
   had moderate methodological quality.ConclusionsThere is insufficient
   evidence for assessing the use of osteobiologics in multilevel hybrid
   surgery and additional high quality and controlled research is deemed
   essential.},

Title = {Nanogel for Selective Recognition of Nanoparticles in Water Samples},
Journal = {CHEMOSENSORS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Nanoparticles (NPs) represent emerging pollutants that still pose
   analytical challenges for their detection in environmentally relevant
   samples due to their extremely low concentrations, high colloidal
   background, and the need to perform speciation analysis. They are also
   one of the interfering matrices during the analysis of metal ions and
   contaminants in water samples. Currently, conventional analytical
   techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and
   Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) are used for the
   detection of NPs, but such techniques require bulky instrumentation and
   are difficult to be automated for online analysis. In this study, we aim
   to develop a nanoparticle-imprinted hydrogel (NPIH, NANOGEL) to detect
   and capture NPs in water samples. The principle of the Nanogel
   originates from the well-known concept of molecularly imprinted polymers
   (MIPs). Cadmium sulfide/Selenide/Zinc sulfide core/shell quantum dots
   (QDs) were used as the template NP, creating specific pore cavities in
   the Nanogel that can selectively bind to certain analytes.
   Quantification of NPs detected in water samples was then made possible
   by transducing this selective detection process into an analytical
   signal using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The Nanogel was shown
   to demonstrate good repeatability, reproducibility, and stability in
   terms of its performance. The high selectivity of the Nanogel was
   determined to be attributed to the size of cavities and their surface
   characteristics. Ionic interference was present and, heavy metal cations
   showed an affinity for the NANOGEL synthesized; however, they were
   demonstrated to be minimized by the selection of porogenic solvents
   during the synthesis of NANOGEL. We believe that the Nanogel would
   provide a highly selective and sensitive approach for the detection of
   NPs in aqueous samples and the removal of NPs from contaminated water
   resources. It will serve useful in environmental applications.},

Title = {Toxic effects of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd) and tetracycline (TC) on the
   growth and development of<i> Triticum</i><i> aestivum:</i> A
   meta-analysis},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},

Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {The environmental issue of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), and tetracycline
   (TC) contamination in cereal crops has become a growing concern
   worldwide. An in-depth understanding of this issue would be of
   importance to promote effective management strategies for heavy metals
   and antibiotics worldwide. The present study was conducted to assess the
   toxic effects of heavy metals (Cd, Pb) and antibiotics (TC) on Triticum
   aestivum (T. aestivum, common wheat) based on studies conducted in the
   past 22 years. Data pertaining to the growth and development of T.
   aestivum were extracted and analyzed from 89 publications spanning from
   2000 to 2022. Our results showed that Pb, Cd and TC significantly
   reduced growth and development by 11 \%, 9 \%, and 5 \%, respectively.
   Additionally, significant accumulation of Cd (42 \%) and Pb (17 \%) was
   observed in T. aestivum samples, although there was little change in TC
   accumulation, which showed limited absorption, accumulation, and
   translocation of TC in wheat plants. Pb had the greatest impact on the
   yield of T. aestivum, followed by Cd, while TC had no apparent effect.
   Furthermore, exposure to Cd, Pb and TC reduced the photosynthetic rate
   due to chlorophyll reduction, with Cd having the most pronounced effect
   (58 \%), followed by Pb (37 \%) and TC (8 \%). Cd exposure also
   significantly enhanced gaseous exchange (37 \%) compared to TC and Pb,
   which reduced gaseous exchange by 4 \% and 10 \%, respectively. However,
   the treatments with TC (>50-100 mgL(-1)), Pb (>1000-2000 mg L-1) and Cd
   (>500-1000 mg L-1) increased the defense system of T. aestivum samples
   by 38 \%, 15 \%, and 11 \%, respectively. The obtained findings have
   significant implications for risk assessment, pollution prevention, and
   remediation strategies to address soil contamination from Pb, Cd and TC
   in farmland.},

Title = {Ecological risks of microplastics contamination with green solutions and
   future perspectives},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {899},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {The rise of plasticulture as mulching material in farming systems has
   raised concerns about microplastics (MPs) in the agricultural landscape.
   MPs are emerging pollutants in croplands and water systems with
   significant ecological risks, particularly over the long term. In the
   soil systems, MPs polymer type, thinness, shape, and size induces
   numerous effects on soil aggregates, dissolved organic carbon (C),
   rapidly oxidized organic C, microbial biomass C, microbial biomass
   nitrogen (N), microbial immobilization, degradation of organic matter, N
   cycling, and production of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), thereby
   posing a significant risk of impairing soil physical and biochemical
   properties over time. Further, toxic chemicals released from
   polyethylene mulching (PMs) might indirectly harm plant growth by
   affecting soil wetting-drying cycles, releasing toxic substances that
   interact with soil matrix, and suppressing soil microbial activity. In
   the environment, accumulation of MPs poses a risk to human health by
   accelerating emissions of GHGs, e.g., methane and carbon dioxide, or
   directly releasing toxic substances such as phthalic acid esters (PAEs)
   into the soils. Also, larger sizes MPs can adhere to root surface and
   block stomata could significantly change the shape of root epidermal
   cells resulting in arrest plant growth and development by restricting
   water-nutrient uptake, and gene expression and altering the biodiversity
   of the soil pollutants. In this review, we systematically analyzed the
   potential risks of MPs to the soil-plant and human body, their
   occurrence, abundance, and migration in agroecosystems. Further, the
   impacts of MPs on soil microbial function, nutrient cycling, soil C, and
   GHGs are mechanistically reviewed, with emphasis on potential green
   solutions such as organic materials amendments along with future
   research directions for more ecofriendly and sustainable plastic
   management in agroecosystems.},

Title = {A novel aerobic denitrifying phosphate-accumulating bacterium
   efficiently removes phthalic acid ester, total nitrogen and phosphate
   from municipal wastewater},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF WATER PROCESS ENGINEERING},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {52},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Simultaneous removal of nitrogen, phosphate and emerging pollutants are
   critical for safe reuse of wastewater, but research in this field is
   limited. In the present study, a novel aerobic denitrifying
   phosphate-accumulating bacterial strain RL-GZ01 was found to be able to
   utilize phthalic acid esters (PAEs) as carbon resource for cell growth.
   Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, physiological and biochemical
   characterization, and genome-based average nucleotide identity
   calculation, RL-GZ01 was identified as Rhodococcus pyridinivorans.
   Strain RL-GZ01 showed high DEHP degradation in alkaline conditions and
   good tolerance of salinity and organic solvents. The degradation of DEHP
   by RL-GZ01 fitted well with a modified Gompertz model (R-2 = 0.9985).
   Metabolic intermediates of DEHP were identified via UHPLC-MS/MS analysis
   and the catabolic pathway was proposed thereafter. Genes and gene
   clusters contributed to the utilization of DEHP were analyzed through
   genomic analysis. Analysis of KEGG nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated
   that nitrate and nitrite were further transformed into ammonium which
   was further used for the biosynthesis of L-glutamine and L-glutamate.
   Strain RLGZ01 was further identified as a denitrifying phosphate
   accumulating organism which can accumulate phosphate by generating
   polyphosphate. Finally, strain RL-GZ01 was applied to municipal
   wastewater treatment for simultaneous removal of nitrogen, phosphate and
   DEHP. The removal percentages of DEHP (5 mg/L), TN (71.2 mg/L), NH4+-N
   (70.9 mg/L), PO43--P (10.89 mg/L) and COD (622.4 mg/L) by strain RL-GZ01
   were 89.94 \%, 64.45 \%, 64.94 \%, 76.30 \% and 63.23 \% within 84 h,
   respectively. These demonstrated the capability of strain RL-GZ01 for
   the biological treatment of wastewater containing PAEs.},

Title = {Metabolome-wide association study of four groups of persistent organic
   pollutants and abnormal blood lipids},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {173},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Environmental exposure increases the risk of dyslipidemia, which affects
   human health. Research has shown that persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs), including per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs),
   polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and phthalate
   metabolites, are associated with a higher risk of abnormal blood lipid
   levels in humans. However, the key molecules involved in dyslipidemia
   and the mecha-nisms are not fully understood. This study aims to
   investigate the biomarkers that mediate the relationships between blood
   lipids and four groups of POPs and revealed their potential mechanisms.
   Specifically, in 278 male blood samples, blood lipid and POPs levels
   were measured and metabolites were detected using untargeted
   metabolomics. Spearman's correlation analysis and binary logistic
   regression were employed to assess the relationship between POPs and
   lipid indexes. We observed that PFASs were associated with a higher risk
   of abnormal total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL),
   while other POPs displayed little association with abnormal lipid
   indexes. Among all the PFASs, 6:2Cl-PFESA was associated with the fewest
   metabolites. A metabolome-wide association study combined with a
   meet-in-the-middle approach was used to identify potential biomarkers
   that mediate the association between POPs and abnormal blood lipids. The
   mediation analysis pointed to 105 significant mediators as potential
   biomarkers mediating the association between PFASs and TC, and 82
   significant mediators were potential biomarkers that mediated the
   association between PFASs and LDL. 24-Hydroxycholesterol,
   3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-al, PC(18:0/0:0),
   PC(22:5/0:0), GPCho (18:1/18:1), LysoPC(22:2(13Z,16Z)), LysoPC(16:0),
   9(S)-HODE, 9,10-DHOME, L-glutamate, 4-hydroxybutyric acid, cytosine,
   PC(14:1(9Z)/18:0), sphinganine, and (S)-beta-aminoisobutyrate were
   identified as important biomarkers. The mechanism may mainly involves
   glycerophospholipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosyn-thesis, and
   linoleic acid metabolism. PPAR gamma likely plays a role in the
   associations between PFASs and abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Overall,
   our study provides clues for the early detection of PFAS-induced
   dyslipidemia and brings forth a theoretical framework for further
   research into this mechanism.},

Title = {Zinc pyrithione induced volatile fatty acids promotion derived from
   sludge anaerobic digestion: Interrelating the affected steps with
   microbial metabolic regulation and adaptive responses},
Journal = {WATER RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {234},
Month = {MAY 1},
Abstract = {The massive use of zinc pyrithione (ZPT, as broad-spectrum bactericides)
   resulted in its high levels in waste activated sludge (WAS) and affected
   subsequent WAS treatment. This work revealed the effects of ZPT on the
   volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during WAS anaerobic digestion, in which
   VFAs yield was enhanced by approximately 6-9 folds (from 353 mg COD/L in
   control to 2526-3318 mg COD/L with low level of ZPT (20-50 mg/g TSS)).
   The ZPT occurred in WAS enabled the acceleration of solubilization,
   hydrolysis and acidification processes while inhibited the
   methanogenesis. Also, the low ZPT contributed to the enrichment of
   functional hydrolytic -acidifying microorganisms (e.g., Ottowia and
   Acinetobacter) but caused the reduction of methanogens (e.g.,
   Methanomassiliicoccus and Methanothrix). Meta-transcriptomic analysis
   demonstrated that the critical genes relevant to extracellular
   hydrolysis (i.e. CLPP and ZapA), membrane transport (i.e. gltI, and
   gltL), substrates metabolisms (i.e. fadj, and acd), and VFAs
   biosynthesis (i.e. porB and porD) were all upregulated by 25.1-701.3\%
   with low level of ZPT. Specifically, the ZPT stimulus on amino acids
   metabolism for VFAs transformation was prominent over carbohydrates.
   Moreover, the functional species enabled to regulate the genes in QS and
   TCS systems to maintain favorable cell chemotaxis to adapt the ZPT
   stress. The cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance pathway was
   upregulated to blunt ZPT with the secretion of more lipopolysaccharide
   and activate proton pumps to maintain ions homeostasis to antagonize the
   ZPT toxicity for high microbial activities, the abundance of related
   genes was up-regulated by 60.5 to 524.5\%. This work enlightened
   environmental behaviors of emerging pollutants on WAS anaerobic
   digestion process with interrelations of microbial metabolic regulation
   and adaptive responses.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF ORTHOPAEDIC SURGERY AND RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {BackgroundThe traction table is generally used in femoral intramedullary
   nailing surgery. Recently, some published studies have shown that the
   same or better treatment effects can be gotten without a traction table.
   It remains no consensus on this issue.MethodsThe Preferred Reporting
   Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses guideline was applied in
   this study. We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane
   Library databases for eligible studies. The random-effect model was used
   to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) and risk ratios with
   95\% CIs. Trial sequential analysis (TSA) was performed to verify the
   results.ResultsThe pooled estimates of seven studies, including 266
   cases each in the manual traction group and traction table group,
   indicated that manual traction could shorten operative time {[}SMD, -
   0.77; 95\% CI (- 0.98, - 0.55); P < 0.00001] and preoperative set-up
   time {[}SMD, - 2.37; 95\% CI (- 3.90, - 0.84); P = 0.002], but it would
   not reduce intraoperative blood loss volume and fluoroscopy time. No
   statistical difference was found in their fracture healing time,
   postoperative Harris scores, and malunion rate. The use of a Traction

   traction table in femoral intramedullary nailing surgery lengthened
   operative time and preoperative set-up time. At the same time, it did
   not show significant advantages in reducing blood loss volume and

Title = {Lumbar Total Disc Replacements for Degenerative Disc Disease: A
   Systematic Review of Outcomes With a Minimum of 5 years Follow-Up},
Journal = {GLOBAL SPINE JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 23},
Abstract = {Study Design: Systematic Review.Objectives: To systematically review the
   clinical outcomes, re-operation, and complication rates of lumbar TDR
   devices at mid-to long-term follow-up studies for the treatment of
   lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD).Methods: A systematic search was
   conducted on PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar to identify follow-up
   studies that evaluated clinical outcomes of lumbar TDR in patients with
   DDD. The included studies met the following criteria: prospective or
   retrospective studies published from 2012 to 2022; a minimum of 5 years
   post-operative follow-up; a study sample size >10 patients; patients >18
   years of age; containing clinical outcomes with Oswestry Disability
   Index (ODI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), complication or reoperation
   rates.Results: Twenty-two studies were included with data on 2284
   patients. The mean follow-up time was 8.30 years, with a mean follow-up
   rate of 86.91\%. The study population was 54.97\% female, with a mean
   age of 42.34 years. The mean VAS and ODI pain score improvements were
   50.71 +/- 6.91 and 30.39 +/- 5.32 respectively. The mean clinical
   success and patient satisfaction rates were 74.79\% +/- 7.55\% and
   86.34\% +/- 5.64\%, respectively. The mean complication and reoperation
   rates were 18.53\% +/- 6.33\% and 13.6\% +/- 3.83\%, respectively. There
   was no significant difference when comparing mid-term and long-term
   follow-up studies for all clinical outcomes.Conclusions: There were
   significant improvements in pain reduction at last follow-up in patients
   with TDRs. Mid-term follow-up data on clinical outcomes, complication
   and reoperation rates of lumbar TDRs were maintained longer term.},

Abstract = {As an emerging type of pollutant, microplastics have become a global
   environmental problem. Approximately, a fifth of the global burden of
   type 2 diabetes can be attributed to air particulate pollution. However,
   scientific knowledge remains limited about the effects of airborne
   nanoplastics (NPs) exposure on metabolic diseases. In this experiment, a
   whole-body exposure system was used to simulate the real atmospheric
   environment, and three exposure concentrations combined with the actual
   environmental concentration were selected to explore the effects of
   airborne NPs on metabolic diseases. Based on histological analyses,
   metabolic studies, gene expression, metabolites, and molecular signaling
   analyses, mice exposed to airborne NPs were observed to show a phenotype
   of systemic inflammation and complete insulin resistance featuring
   excessive drinking and eating, weight loss, elevated blood glucose, and
   decreased triglyceride levels. After airborne NPs exposure, mice were
   intolerant to glucose and tolerant to insulin. In addition, airborne NPs
   exposure could result in long-term irreversible hyperglycemia. Together,
   the research findings provide a strong basis for understanding the
   hazards of airborne nanopollution on metabolic disorders.},

Abstract = {Background Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal, progressive
   neurogenerative disease caused by combined genetic susceptibilities and
   environmental exposures. Identifying and validating these exposures are
   of paramount importance to modify disease risk. We previously reported
   that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) associate with ALS risk and
   survival and aimed to replicate these findings in a new cohort.Method
   Participants with and without ALS recruited in Michigan provided plasma
   samples for POPs analysis by isotope dilution with triple quadrupole
   mass spectrometry. ORs for risk models and hazard ratios for survival
   models were calculated for individual POPs. POP mixtures were
   represented by environmental risk scores (ERS), a summation of total
   exposures, to evaluate the association with risk (ERSrisk) and survival
   (ERSsurvival).Results Samples from 164 ALS and 105 control participants
   were analysed. Several individual POPs significantly associated with
   ALS, including 8 of 22 polychlorinated biphenyls and 7 of 10
   organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). ALS risk was most strongly represented
   by the mixture effects of OCPs alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane,
   hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor and cis-nonachlor and an
   interquartile increase in ERSrisk enhanced ALS risk 2.58 times
   (p<0.001). ALS survival was represented by the combined mixture of all
   POPs and an interquartile increase in ERS(survival )enhanced ALS
   mortality rate 1.65 times (p=0.008).Conclusions These data continue to
   support POPs as important factors for ALS risk and progression and
   replicate findings in a new cohort. The assessments of POPs in
   non-Michigan ALS cohorts are encouraged to better understand the global
   effect and the need for targeted disease risk reduction strategies.},

Title = {Unravelling joint cytotoxicity of ibuprofen and oxytetracycline on
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii using a programmed cell death-related
   biomarkers panel},
Journal = {AQUATIC TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {257},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) are emerging contaminants that
   pose a growing concern due to their ubiquitous presence and harmful
   impact on aquatic ecosystems. Among PhACs, the anti-inflammatory
   ibuprofen (IBU) and the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) are two of the
   most used compounds whose presence has been reported in different
   aquatic environments worldwide. However, there is still scarce
   information about the cellular and molecular alterations provoked by IBU
   and OTC on aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms as microalgae, even
   more if we refer to their potential combined toxicity. To test the cyto-
   and genotoxicity provoked by IBU, OTC and their binary combination on
   Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a flow cytometric panel was performed after
   24 h of single and co-exposure to both contaminants. Assayed parameters
   were cell vitality, metabolic activity, intracellular ROS levels, and
   other programmed cell death (PCD)-related biomarkers as cytoplasmic and
   mitochondrial membrane potentials and caspase-like and endonuclease
   activities. In addition, a nuclear DNA fragmentation analysis by comet
   assay was carried out. For most of the parameters analysed (vitality,
   metabolic activity, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potentials,
   and DNA fragmentation) the most severe damages were observed in the
   cultures exposed to the binary mixture (IBU+OTC), showing a joint cyto-
   and genotoxicity effect. Both PhACs and their mixture caused a
   remarkable decrease in cell proliferation and metabolic activity and
   markedly increased intracellular ROS levels, parallel to a noticeable
   depolarization of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, a
   strong increase in both caspase and endonuclease activities as well as a
   PCD-related loss of nuclear DNA integrity was observed in all
   treatments. Results analysis showed that the PhACs caused cell death on
   this non-target organism, involving mitochondrial membrane
   depolarization, enhanced ROS production and activation of PCD process.
   Thus, PCD should be an applicable toxicological target for unraveling
   the harmful effects of co-exposure to PhACs in aquatic organisms as
   microalgae.},

Title = {Bibliometric analysis and systematic review of the adherence, uptake,

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {906},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Micro/nanoplastics are emerging agricultural pollutants globally.
   Micro/nanoplastics can adhere to terrestrial plant surfaces, be absorbed
   and transported by plants, and accumulate in the edible parts of plants,
   leading to the possibility of enrichment and transmission through the
   food chain and threatening human health. However, the underlying
   mechanism remains unclear. With increased studies on the internalization
   of micro/nanoplastics in terrestrial plants, a comprehensive and
   systematic review summarizing the current research trends and progress
   is warranted to provide a reference for further relevant research. Based
   on bibliometric analysis, this study focused on the mechanisms, study
   methods, and reduction techniques of micro/nanoplastics adherence,
   uptake, and translocation by terrestrial plants. The results showed that
   micro/nanoplastics can adhere to the surfaces of plant tissues such as
   seeds, roots, and leaves. Root uptake (root-to-leaf translocation) and
   foliar uptake (leaf-to -root translocation) are the two simultaneous
   internalization pathways of MNPs in plants. The observation methods
   included scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning
   microscopy (CLSM), pyrolysis -gas chromatography-mass spectrometry
   (Py-GC/MS), and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).
   We highlighted the necessity and urgency of reducing the uptake and
   translocation of MNPs by plants and found that the application of
   silicon may be a promising approach for reducing internalization. This
   study identifies current knowledge gaps and proposes possible future
   needs.},

Abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of early
   exposure to agricultural pesticides and their relationship with autism
   spectrum disorder.Data source: This systematic review was registered at
   PROSPERO as CRD42020204842. The subject was systematically analyzed on
   PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases until April 2021. Only
   studies with humans with early exposure to agricultural pesticides and
   diagnosis of autism were included. Exclusion criteria were studies on
   pesticides for domestic or veterinary use and late exposure. There were
   no language and time restriction. The quality analysis of the studies
   used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale.Data synthesis: Six case-control studies
   were included; three of them measured the route of exposure by maternal
   biomarkers and the others by the residence address. The studies had
   scores between moderate and high in the quality assessment tool. It was
   found high rates of association between early exposure to agricultural
   pesticides and autism and detection limit above the quantification for a
   sample of polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene, and

   concerning the exposure to agricultural pesticides in early life and the
   development of the autism spectrum disorder; however, more studies are
   required to better understand their possible association.},

Abstract = {Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) based on ultrasound (US) have
   attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its advantages
   in the degradation of landfill leachate. The review summarizes the
   existing treatment methods of leachate from labscale, compares their

   described. Moreover, this review also expounds on the advantages of
   dual-frequency US (DFUS) technology compared with single-frequency US,
   and a theoretically feasible DFUS process is proposed to treat ECs in
   the leachate. Finally, suggestions and prospects for US technologies in
   treating landfill leachate are put forward to aid future research on
   landfill leachate treatment. Meaningfully, this manuscript will provide
   reference values of US-based technologies in landfill leachate

Abstract = {Chronic exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is suspected to
   contribute to the onset of breast cancer, but the impact on the
   evolution of patients after diagnosis is unclear. We aimed to analyze
   the contribution of long-term exposure to five POPs to overall
   mortality, cancer recurrence, metastasis, and development of second
   primary tumors over a global follow-up of 10 years after surgery in
   breast cancer patients in a cohort study. Between 2012 and 2014, a total
   of 112 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were recruited from a
   public hospital in Granada, Southern Spain. Historical exposure to POPs
   was estimated by analyzing their concentrations in breast adipose tissue
   samples. Sociodemographic data were collected through face-to-face
   interviews, while data on evolution tumor were retrieved from clinical
   records. Statistical analyses were performed using Cox regression
   (overall survival, breast cancer recurrence or metastasis) and binary
   logistic regression models (joint outcome variable). We also tested for
   statistical interactions of POPs with age, residence, and prognostic
   markers. The third vs first tertile of hexachlorobenzene concentrations
   was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio,
   HR = 0.26; 95 \% Confidence Interval, CI = 0.07-0.92) and of the
   appearance of any of the four events (Odds Ratio = 0.37; 95 \% CI =

   significantly and inversely associated with risk of metastasis (HR =
   0.65; 95 \% CI = 0.44-0.97) and tumor recurrence (HR = 0.69; 95 \% CI =
   0.49-0.98). Additionally, p,p \& PRIME;dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene
   showed inverse associations with risk of metastasis in women with
   ER-positive tumors (HR = 0.49; 95 \% CI = 0.25-0.93) and in those with a

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {856},

Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Although microplastics are emerging marine pollutants that have recently
   attracted increasing attention, it is still dif-ficult to identify their
   sources. This study reviewed 6487 articles to determine current research
   trends and found 237 effective concentration points after sorting, which
   were distributed in four regions and related to freshwater ecosys-tems.
   Results found that 15 environmental variables represented natural and
   anthropogenic environmental character-istics, of which seven
   environmental variables were selected for experimental modelling. Random
   forest models fitted sample data, thus facilitating the identification
   of regional microplastics distribution. The global random forest model
   had random forest importance scores (RFISs) for gross domestic product,
   population, and the proportion of agricultural land use were 15.76 \%,
   15.64 \%, and 14.74 \%, respectively; these indicate that human
   activities significantly affected the global distribution of
   microplastics. In Asia, agriculture and urban activities are the main
   sources of microplastics, with an RFIS of 11.58 \% and 12.24 \% for the
   proportion of agricultural and urban land use, respectively. Activities
   in urban areas were determined to be the main influencing factors in
   North America, with an RFIS of 13.92 \% for the pro-portion of urban
   land use. Agricultural activities were the main influencing factors in
   Europe, with RFISs for the pro-portion of agricultural land use of 16.90
   \%. Our results indicate that region-specific policies are required to
   control microplastics in different regions, with soil composition being
   a latency factor that affects microplastics' distribution.},

Abstract = {Many human diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases, autism and
   diabetes are associated with exposure to pesticides, especially
   organochlorine pesticides. However, pesticide exposure is also
   associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the leading cause of
   death worldwide. In this systematic review, results on the link between
   organochlorine pesticide pollution and CVD were collected from databases
   (Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Science Direct) in May 2022 from studies
   published between 2010 and 2022. A total of 24 articles were selected
   for this systematic review. Sixteen articles were extracted by reviewers
   using a standardized form that included cross-sectional, cohort, and
   ecological studies that reported exposure to organochlorine pesticides
   in association with increased CVD risk. In addition, eight articles
   covering molecular mechanisms organochlorine pesticides and
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on cardiovascular effects were
   retrieved for detailed evaluation. Based on the findings of the study,
   it seems elevated circulating levels of organochlorine pesticides and
   PCBs increase the risk of coronary heart disease, especially in early
   life exposure to these pesticides and especially in men. Changes in the
   regulatory function of peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma receptor
   (PPAR gamma), reduction of paroxonase activity (PON1), epigenetic
   changes of histone through induction of reactive oxygen species,
   vascular endothelial inflammation with miR-expression 126 and miR-31,
   increased collagen synthesis enzymes in the extracellular matrix and
   left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and fibrosis are mechanisms by which
   PCBs increase the risk of CVD. According to this systematic review,
   organochlorine pesticide exposure is associated with increased risk of
   CVD and CVD mortality through the atherogenic and inflammatory molecular
   mechanism involving fatty acid and glucose metabolism.},

   of degenerative spinal diseases: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {NEURORADIOLOGY JOURNAL},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 NOV 3},
Abstract = {Background Percutaneous cement discoplasty (PCD) is a minimally invasive
   procedure. We aim to explore the efficacy and indication(s) of PCD in
   patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD).Methods The search was
   conducted across Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PubMed. Data on study
   design, patient demographics, pre- and post-procedure Visual Analog
   Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and
   complications were extracted. Inclusion criteria focused on adult
   patients with degenerative spinal diseases treated with cement
   discoplasty. The overall effect size was evaluated using a forest plot,
   and heterogeneity was assessed using the I-2 statistic and chi-squared
   test.Results The search strategy yielded six studies, which included 336
   patients (73.8\% female, 26.2\% male) with a mean average age of 74.6
   years. VAS scores were reported in all studies, showing a significant
   difference between pre- and post-PCD pain scores (Weighted Mean
   Difference {[}WMD]: -3.45; 95\% CI: -3.83, -3.08; I-2 = 15\%; P < .001).
   ODI scores were reported in 83\% of studies, with a significant
   difference between pre- and post-PCD scores (WMD: -22.22; 95\% CI:
   -25.54, -18.89; I-2 = 61\%; p < .001). Complications reported included
   infections, thrombophlebitis, vertebral fractures, disc extrusion, and
   the need for further operations.Conclusions The analysis showed
   clinically significant improvements in pain and functional disability
   based on VAS and ODI scores. However, due to methodological limitations
   and a high risk of bias, the validity and generalizability of the
   findings are uncertain. Despite these issues, the results provide
   preliminary insights into PCD's potential efficacy and can guide future
   research to address current limitations.},

Title = {Chemical contaminant levels in edible seaweeds of the Salish Sea and
   implications for their consumption},
Journal = {PLOS ONE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {17},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 23},
Abstract = {Despite growing interest in edible seaweeds, there is limited
   information on seaweed chemical contaminant levels in the Salish Sea.
   Without this knowledge, health-based consumption advisories can not be
   determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations, Asian
   and Pacific Islander community members, and recreational harvesters. We
   measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus,
   F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish
   Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22
   organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We
   compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening
   levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then
   worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels
   or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo{[}a]pyrene {[}BaP], and
   PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based
   screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two
   samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA
   noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at
   all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because
   there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be
   conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As
   screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the
   inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation,
   we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed
   was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming
   other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern
   (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be
   considered. Additionally, although we focused on toxicological aspects,
   there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect
   consumer choice.},

Title = {Consumption of fruits and vegetables contaminated with pesticide
   residues in Brazil: A systematic review with health risk assessment},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {322},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Brazil is the third largest exporter of fruits and vegetables in the
   world and, consequently, uses large amounts of pesticides. Food
   contamination with pesticide residues (PRs) is a serious concern,
   especially in developing countries. Several research reports revealed
   that some Brazilian farmers spray pesticides on fruits and vegetables in
   large quantities, generating PRs after harvest. Thus, ingestion of food
   contaminated with PRs can cause adverse health effects. Based on
   information obtained through a systematic review of essential
   information from 33 articles, we studied the assessment of potential
   health risks associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in children
   and adults from Brazilian states. This study identified 111 PRs
   belonging to different chemical groups, mainly organophosphates and
   organochlorines, in 26 fruit and vegetable samples consumed and exported
   by Brazil. Sixteen of these PRs were above the Maximum Residue Limit
   (MRL) established by local and international legislation. We did not
   identify severe acute and chronic dietary risks, but the highest risk
   values were observed in Sa tilde o Paulo and Santa Catarina, associated
   with the consumption of tomatoes and sweet peppers due to the high
   concentrations of organophosphates. A high long-term health risk is
   associated with the consumption of oranges in Sa tilde o Paulo and
   grapes in Bahia due to chlorothalonil and procymidone. We also
   identified that 26 PRs are considered carcinogenic by the United States
   Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), and the carcinogenic risk
   analysis revealed no severe risk in any Brazilian state investigated due
   to the cumulative hazard index (HI) < 1. However, the highest HI values
   were in Sa tilde o Paulo due to acephate and carbaryl in sweet pepper
   and in Bahia due to dichlorvos. This information can help regulatory
   authorities define new guidelines for pesticide residue limits in fruits
   and vegetables commonly consumed and exported from Brazil and monitor
   the quality of com-mercial formulations.},

Title = {Indoor residual spraying for the control of visceral leishmaniasis: A
   systematic review},
Journal = {PLOS NEGLECTED TROPICAL DISEASES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {16},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Author summaryVisceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a vector borne disease
   endemic in Southeast Asia (SEA) and present in other regions of the
   world. VL is transmitted by different species of sandflies and key
   strategies against VL rely on the control of the vectors. This
   systematic review assesses the efficacy and community effectiveness of
   indoor residual spraying (IRS) in controlling sandflies and VL
   occurrence among humans. After a revision of 8822 initial hits, 21
   studies were included in this systematic review.Effects of IRS on vector
   populations are positive, Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce
   total sandfly counts by up to 95\% for at least one month. DDT has been
   used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be
   measured, this effect waned over time. Combinations of different
   interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some
   promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos.
   Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of
   IRS are confirmed as key issues for control programmes. No human
   transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS on
   human transmission,-although by modelling studies an effect of IRS on
   human transmission can be demonstrated.
   Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is one of the interventions to control
   the vectors of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Different insecticides are
   used in affected countries, also in the Regional Initiative for the
   Elimination of VL in South-East Asia. This systematic review assesses
   all available studies analysing the effectiveness of IRS on the key
   vectors of VL. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, with a
   broad search strategy, applied to seven key databases. Inclusion
   criteria were studies focusing on 1) Visceral leishmaniasis 2) Indoor
   Residual Spraying (IRS) or synonyms, and 3) all primary research
   methods. 21 studies were included, five cluster randomised controlled
   trials (cRCTs), one randomised controlled trial (RCT), 11 intervention
   studies, also included were three modelling studies and one survey. 19
   out of 21 included studies were published between 2009 and 2020. 18 of
   the studies were conducted in the context of the Regional Initiative.
   Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, confirmed in terms of
   effectiveness and by the availability of studies. Deltamethrin and
   alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts, and/or Phlebotomus
   argentipes counts by up to 95\% with an effect of a minimum of one
   month. Prolonged effects are not regularly seen. DDT has been used in
   India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this
   effect waned over time. Two intervention studies, embedded in larger
   programmes in 2019 and 2020, replaced DDT with alpha-Cypermethrin
   throughout the study. Combinations of different interventions are not
   systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for
   example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of
   insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as
   key issues for programmes. No human transmission data are available to
   directly relate an effect of IRS-although modelling studies confirm the
   effect of IRS on human transmission. Concluding, IRS continues to be an
   effective intervention for Phlebotomus argentipes control. Delivery
   requires constant monitoring and quality assurance. Further studies need
   to assess IRS in different geographical areas affected by VL and
   combinations of interventions.},

Title = {Occurrence and prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes and pathogens
   in an industrial park wastewater treatment plant},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {880},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens are emerging
   environmental pollutants that pose a threat to human health and
   ecosystem. Industrial park wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treat
   large amounts of comprehensive wastewater derived from industrial
   production and park human activity, which is possible a source of ARGs
   and pathogens. Therefore, this study investigated the occurrence and
   prevalence of ARGs, ARGs hosts and pathogens and assesses the ARGs
   health risk in the biological treatment process in a large-sale
   industrial park WWTP using metagenomic analysis and omics-based
   framework, respectively. Results show that the major ARG subtypes are
   multidrug resistance genes (MDRGs), macB, tetA(58), evgS, novA, msbA and
   bcrA and the ARGs main hosts were genus Acidovorax, Pseudomonas,
   Mesorhizobium. In particular, all determined ARGs genus level hosts are
   pathogens. The total removal percentage of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens
   were 12.77 \%, 12.96\% and 25.71\% respectively, suggesting that the
   present treatment could not efficiently remove these pollutants. The
   relative abundance of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens varied along biological
   treatment process that ARGs and MDRGs were enriched in activated sludge
   and pathogens were enriched in both secondary sedimentation tank and
   activated sludge. Among 980 known ARGs, 23 ARGs (e.g., ermB, gadX and
   tetM) were assigned into risk Rank I with characters of enrichment in
   the human-associated environment, gene mobility and pathogenicity. The
   results indicate that industrial park WWTPs might serve as an important
   source of ARGs, MDRGs, and pathogens. These observations invite further
   study of the origination, development, dissemination and risk assessment
   of industrial park WWTPs ARGs and pathogens.},

Abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) . are emerging environmental
   pollutants, and the effect of both abiotic (e.g., anthropogenic
   pollutants such as sulfonamides (SAs)) and biotic (e.g., microbial
   community (taxonomy), mobile genetic elements (MGEs)) factors on the
   antibiotic resistome (collection of ARGs) has received much attention
   recently. In addition, function (e.g., CAZy, eggNOG and KEGG) is also an
   important biotic factor; however, how function correlates to ARGs and
   thus contributes to the antibiotic resistome remains ambiguous. This
   work explores the effect of sulfonamides (SAs) on ARGs and MGEs by a
   metagenomic analysis, a principal component analysis (PCA), and a
   nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS). Then, the work
   establishes a correlation between ARGs and function with a co-occurrence
   network and reveals the contribution and positive (negative)/direct
   (indirect) effect of taxonomy, MGEs, and function to the antibiotic
   resistome by variation partitioning analysis (VPA) and partial
   least-squares-path modeling (PLS-PM). The results show that the soil has
   diverse ARGs and several MGEs and SAs impose significant effects on
   them. Further, CAZy, eggNOG, and KEGG (including pathway and orthology)
   show strong and significant correlation with ARGs on the basis of the
   co-occurrence network; however, in our system it seems that only the
   KEGG pathway promotes the interpretation of ARGs and should be regarded
   as the priority function on considering the role of function in
   structuring the antibiotic resistome. This work reveals the importance
   and necessity of function as a biotic factor in shaping the antibiotic
   resistome in diverse resistome-related fields.},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Fruit allergies manifest with a diverse array of clinical presentations,
   ranging from localized contact allergies and oral allergy syndrome to
   the potential for severe systemic reactions including anaphylaxis. The
   scope of population-level prevalence studies remains limited, largely
   derived from single-center or hospital-based investigations. In this
   comprehensive review, we conducted a systematic literature search
   spanning the years 2009 to 2023, with full acknowledgment of potential
   analytical biases, to provide a global overview of fruit allergy
   prevalence. The primary mechanistic underpinning of fruit allergies
   stems from cross-reactivity between aeroallergens and food allergens, a
   consequence of structurally similar epitopes-a phenomenon recognized as
   pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS). In the era of molecular
   allergology, numerous studies have dissected allergen components with
   substantial clinical relevance. Within this review, we explore important
   allergenic molecules found in plant-based foods, scrutinize pertinent
   cross-reactivity patterns, and offer insights into management
   recommendations. Additionally, we compare guideline recommendations to
   enhance clinical understanding and inform decision making.},

Abstract = {PurposeWe aimed to describe a case series of patients diagnosed with
   trigeminal neuralgia (TN) who were submitted to microvascular
   decompression (MVD) using autologous muscle graft (AMG) and perform a
   systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodsForty-four adult patients who
   underwent MVD using AMG between 2012 and 2022 were studied
   retrospectively. Demographic, clinical, and surgical factors were
   assessed. We systematically reviewed PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane
   Library from inception to May 2023. We used random-effects model for all
   outcomes. Heterogeneity was assessed with I2. We used R software 4.3.1
   for all statistical analyses.ResultsAmong patients in the case series,
   the mean age was 52 +/- 12.9 years, and the proportion of females was
   65.9\%. Forty-one patients (93.2\%) presented complete pain relief after
   a mean follow-up of 7.7 years. The pooled analysis of immediate pain
   relief was 91.3\% (95\% CI 82-96\%; I2=78\%). The good pain relief
   during follow-up was 88.2\% (95\% CI 78-94\%; I2=80\%) at follow-up. The
   recurrence rates at 6, 12, 36 months, and during follow-up were 6.2\%,
   10.5\%, 10.3\%, and 11\%, respectively.ConclusionIn this case series and
   meta-analysis of over 440 patients, our findings suggest that the
   practice of MVD using AMG may be an efficient option in the short term
   as surgical treatment for TN. Further trials should compare AMG with
   other materials and its effectiveness in a long-term follow-up.},

Journal = {BMC MEDICAL RESEARCH METHODOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {24},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 8},
Abstract = {Meta-analysis poses a challenge when original study results have been
   expressed in a non-uniform manner, such as when regression results from
   some original studies were based on a log-transformed key independent
   variable while in others no transformation was used. Methods of
   re-expressing regression coefficients to generate comparable results
   across studies regardless of data transformation have recently been
   developed. We examined the relative bias of three re-expression methods
   using simulations and 15 real data examples where the independent
   variable had a skewed distribution. Regression coefficients from models
   with log-transformed independent variables were re-expressed as though
   they were based on an untransformed variable. We compared the
   re-expressed coefficients to those from a model fit to the untransformed
   variable. In the simulated and real data, all three re-expression
   methods usually gave biased results, and the skewness of the independent
   variable predicted the amount of bias. How best to synthesize the
   results of the log-transformed and absolute exposure evidence streams
   remains an open question and may depend on the scientific discipline,
   scale of the outcome, and other considerations.},

Journal = {PROSTATE CANCER AND PROSTATIC DISEASES},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 JUL 25},
Abstract = {IntroductionFocal therapy (FT) is a promising alternative with curative
   intent for Low- to Intermediate-risk localized Prostate Cancer (PCa),
   claiming better functional outcomes and safety profile than standard
   whole-gland treatments. Ten different FT modalities have been described
   in the literature. The objective of our narrative review is to evaluate
   the safety profile and functional outcomes of these different modalities
   and the current most used tools of assessment for those
   outcomes.Material and methodsLiterature search was performed on 21st
   February 2023 using PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus, following the Preferred
   Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement
   (PRISMA). Articles reporting whole-gland treatments were excluded. All
   articles reporting functional outcomes were
   included.ResultsOne-hundred-seven studies, reporting data on 6933
   patients, were included (26 on High Intensity Focal Ultrasound, 22 on
   Focal Cryotherapy, 14 on Irreversible Electroporation, 11 on Focal
   brachytherapy, 10 on Focal Laser Ablation, 8 on Photodynamic Therapy, 3
   on Microwave ablation, 3 on Robotic Partial Prostatectomy, 2 on bipolar
   Radio Frequency Ablation, 1 on Prostatic Artery Embolization, and 7
   studies comparing different FTs). Post-operative pad-free rate ranged
   between 92.3-100\%. Greater heterogeneity exists considering the Change
   in Erectile Function, with Changing in Erectile function- rates ranging
   between 0-94.4\% (Cryotherapy). The most used Patient-Reported Outcome
   Measures (PROMs) were the International Prostate Symptom Score and the
   International Index of Erectile Function for incontinence/urinary
   function and potency, respectively. The most common reported
   complications were hematuria, infections, and urethral strictures, with
   rates widely ranging among different treatments. The Clavien-Dindo
   Classification was the most used (40/88 papers) to describe adverse
   events.ConclusionFT is a promising treatment for localized PCa,
   achieving excellent results in terms of safety and functional outcomes.
   There is a wide heterogeneity in the definition of PROMS and time of
   collection between studies. High quality comparative studies with
   standard treatments are needed to reinforce these findings.},

Title = {Lack of association between endocrine disrupting chemicals and male
   fertility: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {217},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {The incidence of infertility currently affects about 15\% of the world's
   population. Male factors are estimated to be responsible for up to
   40-50\% of these cases. While the cause of these reproductive disorders
   is still unclear, the exposure to a family of ubiquitous compounds in
   our daily life, named endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) could be
   involved. This paper was aimed at performing a systematic review and
   meta-analysis of population studies exploring whether human male
   exposure to EDCs affects male fertility. Clinical and observational
   studies assessing the exposure to EDCs along with sperm quality, the
   most common reproductive disorders, sperm DNA damage, sperm oxidative
   stress, fertilization rate, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate,
   live birth rate, and miscarriage rate were included. The quality
   assessment tool from the NHLBI-NIH was used to assure that studies met
   standardized quality criteria. Sensitivity analysis and heterogeneity
   among studies was assessed. Overall, the 32 selected articles, including
   7825 individuals in the systematic review, explored 12 families of EDCs.
   The results revealed a high heterogeneity among studies in relation to
   the association between exposure to EDCs and the endpoints analyzed.
   Meta-analyses were performed with data from 7 articles including 479
   individuals, 4 articles assessing the association between BPA in urine
   and sperm quality, and 3 articles evaluating PCB153 in serum and sperm
   quality. In the meta-analysis, we identified an unpredicted significant
   positive association between PCB153 exposure and sperm concentration.
   However, it would not be clinically relevant. No positive or inverse
   associations were found neither for BPA, nor for PCB153 and the rest of
   sperm parameters analyzed. The high disparity between studies made
   difficult to draw conclusions on the potential harmful effects of EDCs
   on male fertility. Consequently, to delineate the potential relationship
   that EDCs can have on male fertility, an important condition stressing
   the health system, further investigations are required.},

Abstract = {Trace metals generally exist at very low concentrations (pM-nM) in
   seawater, and could function as nutrients, contaminants, and tracers of
   various oceanographic processes. However, collection of seawater samples
   for a trace metal analysis without contamination is difficult because
   they exist ubiquitously. We present a detailed trace-metal-clean
   seawater sampling system that has been constructed on the ice-breaking
   research vessel (IBR/V) Araon. This sampling system consists of
   commercially available components without custom fabrication to minimize
   costs. The system consists of a polyurethane-coated aluminum rosette
   frame, 12-L Teflon-coated Niskin-X samplers, nonmetallic rope, and
   autofiring module that enables an automatic bottle firing. Using this
   system, seawater samples were collected in the Ulleung Basin, East Sea
   (Japan Sea), and the concentrations of dissolved trace metals (Mn, Fe,
   Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed. Comparisons of trace metal
   concentrations to those obtained from the normal sampling system and
   previous data showed that our clean seawater sampling system could be
   utilized without metal contamination.},

Title = {Capabilities of simultaneous 193 nm - LIBS/LA-ICP-MS imaging for
   microplastics characterization},
Journal = {TALANTA},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {269},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are currently one of the major environmental
   challenges within our society. With the awareness of the impact of MPs
   on the environment increasing over the last years, the need for
   increased monitoring as well as comprehensive analysis to better
   understand the fate and impact of MPs has become more and more
   important. A major aspect of MP characterization is the assignment of
   the polymer type of individual particles. Here, per-and poly-fluoroalkyl
   substances (PFAS), originating from fluor-containing polymers, have
   gained a lot of attention due to the severe environmental impact.
   Additionally, quantitative analysis of the metal content is of great
   interest in the field, since MPs are prone to either leaching
   (in)organic additives into the environment or taking up and accumulating
   hazardous components (e.g., heavy metals). In this work we demonstrate
   the capabilities of a simultaneous LIBS/LA-ICP-MS setup for the analysis
   of MPs. In the first part, we demonstrate the potential of targeted LIBS
   analysis for the imaging of fluor-containing polymers. Using a laser
   spot size of 5 mu m combined with highly sensitive ICCD detection
   enables analysis of particles in the low mu m range. In the second part
   we combine the polymer-identification capabilities of LIBS with the high
   sensitivity of ICP-MS to perform matrix-matched quantification of the
   metal content of individual MPs. In this case we use a spot size of 50
   mu m facilitating polymer classification with a broadband spectrometer,
   resulting in detection limits of 0.72 mu g/g for Pb and 9.5 mu g/g for
   Sn simultaneously measured using ICP-MS.},

Title = {The Association between Maternal Urinary Phthalate Concentrations and
   Blood Pressure in Pregnancy: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis},
Journal = {METABOLITES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {13},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Phthalates are commonly found in a wide range of environments and have
   been linked to several negative health outcomes. While earlier research
   indicated a potential connection between phthalate exposure and blood
   pressure (BP) during pregnancy, the results of these studies remain
   inconclusive. The objective of this meta-analysis was to elucidate the
   relationship between phthalate exposure and BP in pregnancy. A
   comprehensive literature search was carried out with PubMed, EMBASE, and
   Web of Science, and pertinent studies published up until 5 March 2023
   were reviewed. Random-effects models were utilized to consolidate the
   findings of continuous outcomes, such as diastolic and systolic BP, as
   well as the binary outcomes of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy
   (HDP). The present study included a total of 10 studies. First-trimester
   MBP exposure exhibited a positive association with mean systolic and
   diastolic BP during both the second and third trimesters (beta = 1.05,
   95\% CI: 0.27, 1.83, I-2 = 93\%; beta = 0.40, 95\% CI: 0.05, 0.74, I-2 =
   71\%, respectively). Second-trimester monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP)
   exposure was positively associated with systolic and diastolic BP in the
   third trimester (beta = 0.57, 95\% CI: 0.01, 1.13, I-2 = 0; beta = 0.70,
   95\% CI: 0.27, 1.13, I-2 = 0, respectively). Conversely, first-trimester
   mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) exposure demonstrated a negative
   association with mean systolic and diastolic BP during the second and
   third trimesters (beta = -0.32, 95\% CI: -0.60, -0.05, I-2 = 0; beta =
   -0.32, 95\% CI: -0.60, -0.05, I-2 = 0, respectively). Additionally,
   monoethyl phthalate (MEP) exposure was found to be associated with an
   increased risk of HDP (OR = 1.12, 95\% CI: 1.02, 1.23, I-2 = 26\%). Our
   study found that several phthalate metabolites were associated with
   increased systolic and diastolic BP, as well as the risk of HDP across
   pregnancies. Nevertheless, given the limited number of studies analyzed,
   additional research is essential to corroborate these findings and
   elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking phthalates to BP changes
   during pregnancy.},

Title = {Conducting evaluations of evidence that are transparent, timely and can
   lead to health-protective actions},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {21},
Number = {1},
Month = {DEC 5},
Abstract = {Background: In February 2021, over one hundred scientists and policy
   experts participated in a web-based Workshop to discuss the ways that
   divergent evaluations of evidence and scientific uncertainties are used
   to delay timely protection of human health and the environment from
   exposures to hazardous agents. The Workshop arose from a previous
   workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and
   which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on `Late Lessons
   from Early Warnings' (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of
   hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction
   measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued
   early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those
   agents. Results: Workshop participants used recent case studies
   including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency -
   Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A
   (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations,
   which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public's
   health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a
   minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and
   information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency
   and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence
   of financial conflicts of interest. Conclusion: The recommendations
   should enhance the production of ``actionable evidence, `` that is,
   reliable evaluations of the scientific evidence to support timely
   actions to protect health and environments from exposures to hazardous
   agents. The recommendations are applicable to policy and regulatory
   settings at the local, state, federal and international levels.},

Abstract = {In this study, we investigated the role of tumor microenvironment and
   serum differential metabolites in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)
   carcinogenesis, providing new evidence for ICC treatment. Serum samples
   from healthy individuals and ICC patients were collected for metabolomic
   analysis. The purine metabolites such as inosine, guanosine,
   hypoxanthine, and xanthine were increased in patient serum. TCGA
   database samples were collected, and the correlation between purine
   metabolism-related genes and ICC clinical features was analyzed using R
   language to obtain the differential genes including PPAT, PFAS, ATIC,
   and IMPDH2. High PPAT expression was associated with poor ICC prognosis.
   A PPAT silencing model in HCCC-9810 cells was constructed. The cell
   phenotype was examined by qRT-PCR, CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry,
   showing a decrease in IMPDH1 expression, colony and invasive cells
   numbers, and an increase in apoptosis. Guanosine reversed IMPDH1
   expression in HCCC-9810 cells, promoting the secretion of inflammatory
   factors IL-6, IL-8, OPN, VEGF, and VCAM-1 and intensifying
   epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression in the cells. In
   nude mice, the IMPDH1 inhibitory drug MMF inhibited tumor growth and
   reduced the expression of tumor stem cell characteristic markers CD133
   and SOX2. Guanosine accelerated the malignant progression of ICC
   inhibition of purine metabolism-related genes, PPAT and IMPDH2,
   suppressed the malignant phenotype in HCCC-9810 cells, and inhibited
   tumor growth.},

Abstract = {The fallopian tubes (FTs) are part of the female upper genital tract.
   The healthy FT provides the biological environment for successful
   fertilization and facilitates the subsequent movement of the conceptus
   to the endometrial cavity. However, when the FT is damaged, as with
   salpingitis, pyosalpinx, and hydrosalpinx, it may increase the risk of
   an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition. Decidualization
   refers to a multifactorial process by which the endometrium changes to
   permit blastocyst implantation. The decidualization reaction is vital
   for endometrial receptivity during the window of implantation. To date,
   no comprehensive review that collates evidence on decidualization in the
   human FT has been conducted. Therefore, the aim of this review is to
   compile the current evidence on cellular decidualization occurring in
   the healthy and pathological FT in women of reproductive age. A
   literature search was conducted using five databases and identified 746
   articles, 24 of which were analyzed based on inclusion and exclusion
   criteria. The available evidence indicates that the FT are able to
   undergo decidual changes under specific circumstances; however, the
   exact mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. Further
   research is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which decidualization
   can occur in the FT.
   Under certain circumstances, the fallopian tubes exhibit molecular
   changes consistent with decidualization.},

Abstract = {In this systematic review and meta-analysis on scabies treatment
   failure, a second dose of ivermectin showed lower failure prevalence,
   which should be considered in all guidelines. The increase in treatment
   failure over time hints atdecreasing mite susceptibility for several
   drugs, but the reasons for failure are rarely assessed. Ideally,
   scabicide susceptibility testing should be implemented in future
   studies.
   Background Treatment failure is considered to be an important factor in
   relation to the increase in scabies incidence over the last decade.
   However, the regional and temporal differences, in addition to the
   predictors of therapy failure, are unclear.Objectives We aimed to
   conduct a systematic review of the prevalence of treatment failure in
   patients with scabies and investigation of associated factors.Methods We
   searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health
   and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to
   August 2021 for randomized and quasi-randomized trials, in addition to
   observational studies that enrolled children or adults diagnosed with
   confirmed or clinical scabies treated with permethrin, ivermectin,
   crotamiton, benzyl benzoate, malathion, sulfur or lindane, and measured
   treatment failure or factors associated with treatment failure. We
   performed a random effects meta-analysis for all outcomes reported by at
   least two studies.Results A total of 147 studies were eligible for
   inclusion in the systematic review. The overall prevalence of treatment
   failure was 15.2\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-17.6; I2 =
   95.3\%, moderate-certainty evidence] with regional differences between
   World Health Organization regions (P = 0.003) being highest in the
   Western Pacific region (26.9\%, 95\% CI 14.5-41.2). Oral ivermectin
   (11.8\%, 95\% CI 8.4-15.4), topical ivermectin (9.3\%, 95\% CI 5.1-14.3)
   and permethrin (10.8\%, 95\% CI 7.5-14.5) had relatively lower failure
   prevalence compared with the overall prevalence. Failure prevalence was
   lower in patients treated with two doses of oral ivermectin (7.1\%, 95\%
   CI 3.1-12.3) compared with those treated with one dose (15.2\%, 95\% CI
   10.8-20.2; P = 0.021). Overall and permethrin treatment failure
   prevalence in the included studies (1983-2021) increased by 0.27\% and
   0.58\% per year, respectively. Only three studies conducted a
   multivariable risk factor analysis; no studies assessed
   resistance.Conclusions A second dose of ivermectin showed lower failure
   prevalence than single-dose ivermectin, which should be considered in
   all guidelines. The increase in treatment failure over time hints at
   decreasing mite susceptibility for several drugs, but reasons for
   failure are rarely assessed. Ideally, scabicide susceptibility testing
   should be implemented in future studies.},

Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {10},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Aims: The atrioventricular block (AVB) is a conduction system problem
   that results from the impairment in the transmission of an impulse from
   the atria to the ventricle, the disease has many etiologies. This
   article aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of dual and
   single-chamber pacemakers in patients with SSS and AVB. Methods: An
   electronic search of PubMed (Medline), EMBASE, and Google Scholar was
   performed from 2000 till August 15th, 2022. Retrieved articles were
   exported to Endnote Reference Library Software, where duplicate studies
   were removed from the list, and only articles meeting the eligibility
   criteria of this study were selected. RevMan 5.4 and STATA 16 software
   were used for the analysis. The modified Cochrane Collaboration's risk
   of bias and New-castle Ottawa scale were used for quality assessment of
   RCTs and observational studies respectively. Results: This study is
   composed of 8953 patients with sick-sinus syndrome and atrioventricular
   block. A total of thirteen outcomes are included in this meta-analysis,
   out of which atrial fibrillation significantly favored dual chamber
   {[}OR = 1.29; 95 \% CI = 1.05-1.59; P = 0.01 I2 = 29 \%] and overall
   complications {[}OR = 0.48; 95 \% CI = 0.29-0.77; p = 0.03 I2 = 0 \%]
   and pneumothorax {[}OR = 0.31; 95 \% CI = 0.10-0.93; p = 0.04, I2 = 0
   \%] were satisfied by single-chamber pacing. Conclusion: This study
   concluded that neither single-chamber nor dual-chamber pacemakers are

Title = {A systematic review of contaminants in donor human milk},
Journal = {MATERNAL AND CHILD NUTRITION},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 JAN 24},
Abstract = {Donor human milk (DHM) from a milk bank is the recommended feeding
   method for preterm infants when the mother's own milk (MOM) is not
   available. Despite this recommendation, information on the possible
   contamination of donor human milk and its impact on infant health
   outcomes is poorly characterised. The aim of this systematic review is
   to assess contaminants present in DHM samples that preterm and
   critically ill infants consume. The data sources used include PubMed,
   EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science. A search of the data sources
   targeting DHM and its potential contaminants yielded 426 publications.
   Two reviewers (S. T. and D. L.) conducted title/abstract screening
   through Covidence software, and predetermined inclusion/exclusion
   criteria yielded 26 manuscripts. Contaminant types (bacterial, chemical,
   fungal, viral) and study details (e.g., type of bacteria identified,
   study setting) were extracted from each included study during full-text
   review. Primary contaminants in donor human milk included bacterial
   species and environmental pollutants. We found that bacterial
   contaminants were identified in 100\% of the papers in which bacterial
   contamination was sought (16 papers) and 61.5\% of the full data set (26
   papers), with the most frequently identified genera being Staphylococcus
   (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) and
   Bacillus (e.g., Bacillus cereus). Chemical pollutants were discovered in
   100\% of the papers in which chemical contamination was sought (eight
   papers) and 30.8\% of the full data set (26 papers). The most frequently
   identified chemical pollutants included perfluoroalkyl substances (six
   papers), toxic metal (one paper) and caffeine (one paper). Viral and
   fungal contamination were identified in one paper each. Our results
   highlight the importance of establishing standardisation in assessing
   DHM contamination and future studies are needed to clarify the impact of
   DHM contaminants on health outcomes.
   This systematic review urges continued research in the field of
   contaminants and donor human milk (DHM) to delineate the risks and
   benefits of its use in premature and critically ill infants. Our review
   reveals traces of chemicals, including PFAs and caffeine, within DHM.
   Bacteria, viruses and fungi are generally removed from DHM via
   pasteurisation.image
   Research regarding chemical contamination in donor human milk (DHM) is
   limited and needs to be studied further to draw appropriate conclusions
   on reducing potential risks for infants.Parents/guardians should be
   educated on the availability of DHM as a supplemental feeding option and
   made aware of the current research in the field.DHM use requires further
   standardisation both within the United States and abroad. This
   standardisation should ensure that risks are not overemphasised and DHM
   is a cost-effective, accessible resource as a short-term intervention
   when used appropriately as part of optimal lactation and breastfeeding
   support.},

Title = {Microplastics in plant-soil ecosystems: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {308},
Month = {SEP 1},
Abstract = {Microplastic pollution is a recognized hazard in aquatic systems, but in
   the past decade has emerged as a pollutant of interest in terrestrial
   ecosystems. This paper is the first formal meta-analysis to examine the
   phytotoxic effects of microplastics and their impact on soil functions
   in the plant-soil system. Our specific aims were to: 1) determine how
   the type and size of microplastics affect plant and soil health, 2)
   identify which agricultural plants are more sensitive to microplastics,
   and 3) investigate how the frequency and amount of microplastic
   pollution affect soil functions. Plant morphology, antioxidant
   production and photosynthesis ca-pacity were impacted by the composition
   of polymers in microplastics, and the responses could be negative,
   positive or neutral depending on the polymer type. Phytotoxicity testing
   revealed that maize (Zea mays) was more sensitive than rice (Oryza
   sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) within the Poaceae family, while
   wheat and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were less sensitive to microplastics
   exposure. Microplastics-impacted soils tend to be more porous and retain
   more water, but this did not improve soil stability or increase soil
   microbial diversity, sug-gesting that microplastics occupied physical
   space but were not integrated into the soil biophysical matrix. The
   meta-data revealed that microplastics enhanced soil evapotranspiration,
   organic carbon, soil porosity, CO2 flux, water saturation, nitrogen
   content and soil microbial biomass, but decreased soil N2O flux, water
   stable ag-gregates, water use efficiency, soil bulk density and soil
   microbial diversity.},

Title = {Interaction between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and
   microorganisms},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {68},
Number = {8},
Pages = {872-885},
Abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are fluorinated substances
   that contain at least one completely fluorinated methyl or methylene
   carbon atom (without any H/Cl/Br/I connected to the carbon atom).
   Because of the excellent thermal stability, high surface activity,
   lipophobicity and hydrophobicity, they are widely used in different
   fields such as non-stick coatings, dental floss, and aqueous
   film-forming foams. PFASs inevitably enter the environments by
   industrial and domestic emissions, and exist stably in the environment.
   In recent years, PFASs pollution becomes a global environmental problem.
   Microorganisms are an indispensable part of the ecosystems, acting as an
   important participant in the material cycle and energy flow. Both
   microbial surfaces and PFASs are relatively hydrophobic, and hydrophobic
   interaction facilitates PFASs to contact microorganisms, which further
   inhibit their activity. In turn, microorganisms could affect the
   transformation and fate of PFASs. Therefore, it is of importance to
   systematically summarize the interaction between PFASs and
   microorganisms in order to provide critical information for better
   understanding the environmental risks of PFASs. This review
   systematically expounded the interaction between PFASs and environmental
   microorganisms. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of PFASs to bacteria was
   highlighted. It was found that PFASs could promote the synthesis and
   release of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and affect the
   composition and structure of EPS, thereby inhibiting the activity of
   extracellular enzymes or destroying the integrity of biofilm. In
   addition, hydrophobic interaction promoted the penetration of PFASs to
   the phospholipid bilayer, increasing the fluidity and permeability of
   the membrane. Furthermore, the increase of membrane permeability caused
   bacterial metabolism disorder, which resulted in the excessive
   production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS could oxidize
   unsaturated fatty acids to malondialdehyde (MDA), and induce
   crosslinking of nucleic acids and lead to DNA damage. Secondly, this
   review elucidated the impact of PFASs on the microbial communities in
   the environments. In the soil and freshwater environments, the changes
   of bacterial abundance are mainly regulated by PFASs concentrations. It
   is worth noting that PFASs at high concentration (>10 mg/kg) reduced the
   abundance of bacteria related to soil nitrogen transformation and
   phosphorus metabolism, thus posing a potential threat to the cycling
   capacities of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. Additionally, sulfur cycle
   and nitrification process in freshwater environment are inhibited by
   high-concentration PFASs (>10 mg/L). In terms of the marine environment,
   the impact of PFASs on microbial communities was much lower than that of
   environmental parameters (e.g., nutrient substances and salinity).
   Finally, the microbial transformation pathway of PFASs was discussed.
   The biofilm formed by microorganisms and their extracellular secretions
   could adsorb and transform/degrade PFASs by different reactions (e.g.,
   Feammox, desulfurization and hydrolysis), mediating by extracellular
   enzymes (e.g., C-SO3- bond lyase, phosphatase and polyurethane enzyme),
   thus affecting the toxicity and fate of PFASs. Moreover, the challenges
   and future perspectives were addressed. PFASs in the biofilm could be
   transferred to the organisms at higher trophic level through the
   parasitic or predatory food chains. Therefore, the risk of PFASs along
   the microbe-based food chain should be further investigated.
   In addition, microorganisms existed in the environments usually in the
   form of community. Current research on the molecular mechanisms of PFASs
   on microbial quorum sensing is relatively lacking, and deserves an
   in-depth investigation. Finally, due to the lack of some metabolite
   standards and instrument detection limit, there are still unidentified
   transformation products in the biotransformation pathways of PFASs. The
   issues highlighted above are suggested to be focused on the further
   investigations.},

   removal and N2O emissions in ditch wetlands by altering microbial
   community and enzymatic activity},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},

Abstract = {Excessive use of feed additives and chemical fertilizers leads to the
   accumulation of antibiotics and heavy metals in water environments.
   Studies have reported the toxicity of combined pollutants on the
   performance and mi-crobial community in sequencing batch reactors.
   However, the influence of combined pollutants on nitrogen removal in
   wetlands remains unclear. Here, an 84 d exposure experiment was
   conducted to investigate the effects of cadmium (Cd) and doxycycline
   (DC) on nitrogen metabolism in ecological ditches using metagenomic
   anal-ysis. The results showed that adding 50 mg L-1 DC at 5 mg L-1 Cd
   stress deteriorated nitrogen removal per-formance and significantly
   increased N2O emissions and lactate dehydrogenase release. However, a
   low level of Cd (0.5 mg L-1) significantly reduced N2O emissions under
   the high DC concentration pressure (50 mg L-1). The increasing Cd
   concentration markedly weakened the inhibition of DC (1 mg L-1) on the
   relative abundances of the dominant genera. Moreover, high
   concentrations of mixed Cd/DC showed stronger inhibitory effects on
   glucokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate
   kinase. NADH had a higher tolerance to mixed Cd/DC than ATP. However,
   low levels of mixed Cd/DC led to a higher abundance of key denitrifying
   enzymes and genes. The assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway increased
   under the mixture of Cd/DC stress, accompanied by an increase in
   ferredoxin-nitrite/nitrate reductase and the abundance of nasA and nirA
   genes. Our results indicate that the presence of low-level Cd could
   alleviate the impact of DC on nitrogen removal and N2O emissions in
   ecological ditches by altering microbial community and enzymatic
   activity associated with transport, metabolism, and gene expression.
   However, the increasing Cd concentration at DC stress could intensify
   the combined toxicity. Overall, our findings provide new insights into
   the ecological toxicity of emerging combined pollutants and their impact
   on biological nitrogen transformation in wastewater treatment systems.},

Journal = {CATALYSTS},

Abstract = {The number of organic pollutants detected in water and wastewater is
   continuously increasing thus causing additional concerns about their
   impact on public and environmental health. Therefore, catalytic
   processes have gained interest as they can produce radicals able to
   degrade recalcitrant micropollutants. Specifically, catalytic ozonation
   has received considerable attention due to its ability to achieve
   advanced treatment performances at reduced ozone doses. This study
   surveys and summarizes the application of catalytic ozonation in water
   and wastewater treatment, paying attention to both homogeneous and
   heterogeneous catalysts. This review integrates bibliometric analysis
   using VOS viewer with systematic paper reviews, to obtain detailed
   summary tables where process and operational parameters relevant to
   catalytic ozonation are reported. New insights emerging from
   heterogeneous and homogenous catalytic ozonation applied to water and
   wastewater treatment for the removal of organic pollutants in water have
   emerged and are discussed in this paper. Finally, the activities of a
   variety of heterogeneous catalysts have been assessed using their
   chemical-physical parameters such as point of zero charge (PZC), pKa,
   and pH, which can determine the effect of the catalysts (positive or
   negative) on catalytic ozonation processes.},

Title = {A sustainable approach for heavy metal remediation from water using
   carbon dot based composites: A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS ADVANCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Month = {MAY},
Abstract = {Cost-effective methods for the removal of water pollutants are emerging
   as an urgent need of the hour owing to the release of a huge number of
   toxic materials into the water bodies. Pollution from toxic synthetic
   chemicals, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers,
   pharmaceutical substances etc. adversely affect aquatic ecosystem. It
   also make the polluted water unusable for human contact or consumption.
   Pollution from heavy metal namely, arsenic, cadmium, nickel, mercury,
   chromium, zinc, lead etc. is becoming a major health risk. Many diseases
   like gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders,
   skin lesions, vascular damage, immune system dysfunction, birth defects,
   and cancer are associated with heavy metal poisoning. Adsorption-based
   methods are highly popular and advantageous because of their low cost,
   high retention time, and good recyclability. Carbon dots are emerging as
   green adsorbents of recent times for various categories of water
   contaminants including heavy metals. The use of bio sources as a green
   precursor to carbon dot synthesis is opening a huge opportunity to
   fabricate inexpensive materials for heavy metal remediation in the
   future. With very high surface functionalities and large speific surface
   area, the adsorption of heavy metals as high as 2000 mg g-1 is
   achievable. In this review, recent development about the use of carbon
   dot-composites with materials such as biopolymers, zeolites, layered
   double hydroxides, spinels and metal-organic frameworks has been
   discussed. Such matrix enhance the water stability of the carbon dots as
   well as synergistically improve the kinetics and thermodynamics of the
   interaction process making it an efficient material for heavy metal
   remediation. The review discusses the synthesis protocols of fabricating
   different carbon dot composites. It lists the various advantages of
   carbon dot-composite over other materials used for heavy metal
   remediation viz. low-cost as most of them are synthesized from biomass.
   Hence, they are biogenic, possessing many functional moieties making
   them efficient and eco-friendly in the removal of heavy metals. In
   addition, the review lists many advantages associated with green carbon
   dot based composites like methods of regeneration and reusability. In a
   nutshell, carbon dot based composites are wonderful sustainable material
   rendering an ideal approach for heavy metal remediation.},

Abstract = {PurposeProton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce acid secretion in the
   stomach and rank as one of the most widely used acid-suppressing
   medicines globally. While PPIs are safe in the short-term, emerging
   evidence shows risks associated with long-term use. Current evidence on
   global PPI use is scarce. This systematic review aims to evaluate global
   PPI use in the general population.MethodsOvid MEDLINE, Embase, and
   International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were systematically searched from
   inception to 31 March 2023 to identify observational studies on oral PPI
   use among individuals aged \& GE; 18 years. PPI use was classified by
   demographics and medication factors (dose, duration, and PPI types). The
   absolute numbers of PPI users for each subcategory were summed and
   expressed as a percentage.ResultsThe search identified data from 28
   million PPI users in 23 countries from 65 articles. This review
   indicated that nearly one-quarter of adults use a PPI. Of those using
   PPIs, 63\% were less than 65 years. 56\% of PPI users were female, and
   ``White{''} ethnicities accounted for 75\% of users. Nearly two-thirds
   of users were on high doses (\& GE; defined daily dose (DDD)), 25\% of
   users continued PPIs for > 1 year, and 28\% of these continued for > 3
   years.ConclusionGiven the widespread use PPIs and increasing concern
   regarding long-term use, this review provides a catalyst to support more
   rational use, particularly with unnecessary prolonged continuation.
   Clinicians should review PPI prescriptions regularly and deprescribe

Title = {Environmental pollutants exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus:
   Evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {332},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Except for known sociodemographic factors, long-term exposure to
   environmental pollutants has been shown to contribute to the development
   of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but the conclusions remain
   controversial. To provide a comprehensive overview of the association
   between environmental pollutants and GDM, we per-formed a systematic
   review and meta-analysis. Several electronic databases (PubMed, Embase,
   Web of Science, Medline and Cochrane) were searched for related
   epidemiological and experimental studies up to September 2022. For
   epidemiological studies, a meta-analysis was carried out to appraise the
   effect of environmental pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), per-and poly-fluoroalkyl
   substances (PFASs), phenols, phthalates (PAEs), polybrominated diphenyl
   ethers (PBDEs) and par-abens exposure on GDM. Moreover, we also
   summarized possible biological mechanisms linking pollution exposure and
   GDM based on the included experimental studies. A total of 80 articles
   were enrolled, including 38 epidemiological studies and 42 experimental
   studies. Meta-analysis results showed that exposure to PAEs {[}OR
   (95\%CI) = 1.07 (1.00, 1.14)], PFASs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.10 (1.01,
   1.19)], as well as PCBs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.18 (1.02, 1.36)] and PBDEs
   {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.33 (1.17, 1.50)] significantly increased the risk of
   GDM, but no significant effects were found for phenols, OCPs, and
   parabens. In addition, experimental studies suggested that the potential
   biological mechanisms of environmental pollutants contributing to GDM
   may involve insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, neurohormonal
   dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetic modification,
   and alterations in gut microbiome. In conclusion, long-term
   environmental pollutants exposure may induce the development of GDM, and
   there may be a synergistic effect between the homologs. However, studies
   conducted on the direct biological link between environmental pollutants
   and GDM were few. More prospective studies and high-quality in vivo and
   in vitro experiments were needed to investigate the specific ef-fects
   and mechanisms.},

Title = {Recent advances and issues in the application of activated carbon for
   water treatment in Africa: A systematic review (2007-2022)},
Journal = {APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE ADVANCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {18},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {Access to clean water remains a challenge in many parts of Africa. This
   is compounded by the increasing pollution levels with increasing
   population and industrialization. Activated carbon remains the most
   widely used adsorbent for the removal of chemical pollutants in both
   drinking water and wastewater treatment processes due to its unique
   chemical properties and a plethora of precursor materials for
   development. However, to date, no available literature has
   systematically summarized the advances in Africa on the adsorptive
   removal of contaminants using activated carbons and research issues such
   as data acquisition and presentation, analysis approaches, citations,
   inconsistencies and adsorption experimental setups remain largely
   undocumented. In this paper, adsorption studies from Africa focusing on
   activated carbons for the removal of various contaminants are reviewed,
   from 2007 to 2022. The study focused on a literature-based approach by
   searching key terms in selected databases. The adsorption data were
   mostly best described by the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models for
   dyes, anions, metal ions pesticides, and pharmaceutical compounds.
   According to the pooled data, the highest adsorption capacity was 1552.5
   mg g-1 for PFOS adsorbed onto H3PO4-activated maize tassel-based carbon.
   The majority of the studies relied on linearized adsorption isotherm and
   kinetic models with coefficient of determination (R2) as the sole
   criterion for determining best-fitting models. Additionally, the
   majority of the studies are batch mode and laboratory-scale studies with
   no desorption and recyclability evaluations. Researchers should be
   careful to present accurate equations and units of parameters with
   proper citations. Pilot -scale and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the
   reported new materials represent an aspect largely unexplored. The fact
   that studies from most African countries, dating beyond 2007, could be

   Nanocomposite with Direct Z-Scheme for Enhanced Photodegradation of
   Xylenol Orange},

Abstract = {In the present study, pristine ZnWO4, CoWO4, and mixed metal
   Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 were synthesized through the hydrothermal process using a
   Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 celcius. The synthesized nanomaterials
   were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques, such as TEM,
   FTIR, UV-vis, XRD, and SEM-EDX-mapping to confirm the formation of
   nanocomposite material. The synthesized materials were explored as
   photocatalysts for the degradation of xylenol orange (XO) under a
   visible light source and a comparative study was explored to check the
   efficiency of the bimetallic co-doped nanocomposite to the pristine
   metal tungstate NPs. XRD analysis proved that reinforcement of Co2+ in
   ZnWO4 lattice results in a reduction in interplanar distance from 0.203
   nm to 0.185 nm, which is reflected in its crystallite size, which
   reduced from 32 nm to 24 nm. Contraction in crystallite size reflects on
   the optical properties as the energy bandgap of ZnWO4 reduced from 3.49
   eV to 3.33 eV in Zn0.5Co0.5WO4, which is due to the formation of a
   Z-scheme for charge transfer and enhancement in photocatalytic
   efficiency. The experimental results suggested that ZnWO4, CoWO4, and
   Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 NPs achieved a photocatalytic efficiency of 97.89\%,
   98.10\%, and 98.77\% towards XO in 120 min of visible solar light
   irradiation. The kinetics of photodegradation was best explained by
   pseudo-first-order kinetics and the values of apparent rate const
   (k(app)) also supported the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of mixed
   metal Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 NPs towards XO degradation.},

Abstract = {Insulin infusion sets (IISs) are an integral and intricate part of
   continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for subjects with type 1
   diabetes, infusing insulin from pump to the subcutaneous space. Insulin
   infusion sets interface with the skin surface, the dermis, and the
   subcutaneous space and may be the cause of infusion failure due to
   biological events or mechanical problems. Novel IISs with extended wear
   time and anti-inflammatory properties to mitigate these issues are
   described in the literature although material-tissue interactions are
   poorly understood. This rapid review focuses on the impact of IIS
   materials and designs on the subcutaneous response in people with
   diabetes and includes literature identified in PubMed, Embase, and
   Cochrane databases. Twenty-one studies were identified for qualitative
   synthesis that encompassed a limited and heterogenic body of evidence
   including 10 clinical reports, six reviews, one case report, two
   abstracts, and two communications. Two clinical reports were randomized
   crossover studies. Reports on materials mostly compared steel versus
   polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) cannulas and suggested no substantial
   difference in tissue response to these materials. Reports on designs
   focused mostly on the angle of cannula insertion. To drive and improve
   research on extended wear and nonimmunogenic IISs, future studies should
   focus on material-tissue interaction as dedicated outcome measures,
   quantified with punch biopsy and imaging techniques such as ultrasound,
   optical coherence tomography, and confocal reflectance microscopy.
   Original studies are required to further a field too young for a
   systematic meta-analysis.},

Title = {Contact-free transposition and interposition techniques for trigeminal
   neuralgia: a systematic review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF NEUROSURGICAL SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {67},

Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Surgical treatment for trigeminal neuralgia (TGN), by
   means of interposition of material between nerve and offending ves-sel,
   has been shown to be highly efficient. In recent years, treatment by
   means of vessel transposition has become more frequent, as in singular
   cases of recurrence, nerval reactions towards interposed material have
   been noted. In this review we research the classic microvascular
   decom-pression (MVD) techniques (interposition) as well as the more
   recent transposition and their effectiveness, considering patient
   outcomes as well as complications and recurrences.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION:
   We searched online databases MEDLINE and LIVIVO, using key words
   trigeminal neuralgia AND transposition/ AND sling/ AND non compressive
   technique/ AND microvascular decompression.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We
   included 8 studies for transposition and 20 studies for the
   interposition, combining for 2045 patients (302 for transposition and
   1743 for interposition). 96.1\% of patients in the transposition and
   93.1\% in the interposition group reported a positive outcome
   immediately postoperatively. At follow-up, 87.4\% in the transposition
   group (follow-up 51.2 months) and 87.9\% of patients in the
   interposition group (follow-up 36.5 months), reported a positive
   outcome. 16.2\% of patients in the transposition and 13.1\% in the
   interposition group had postoperative complications. Recurrence was
   reported in 5.6\% of patients treated with transposition and 2.3\% of
   patients treated with interposi-tion. CONCLUSIONS: Transposition
   presents similar results concerning short-and long-term patient
   satisfaction for treatment of TGN as well as similar numbers of
   complications of recurrences as interposition. Yet, current evidence is
   restricted to a few retrospective studies, thus, evidence is limited so
   far.},

Title = {Fractal Structure Characteristics and Prospecting Direction of Dispersed
   Metals in the Eastern Guizhou Pb-Zn Metallogenic Belt, SW China},
Journal = {MINERALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The eastern Guizhou Pb-Zn metallogenic belt (EGMB) is an important
   source of Pb-Zn resources and other critical minerals (including
   dispersed metals, such as Ge, Cd and Ga) in China. In order to ensure
   the continuous resource supply of Pb-Zn and associated dispersed metals,
   it is urgent to explore the direction of further prospecting for them.
   Fractal theory can realize the fractal structure characterization of
   fault structures and the spatial distribution of mineral deposits, which
   is helpful for mineral exploration. However, the fault fractal research
   and prospecting application are still seldom covered in the EGMB. We
   used fractal theory to determine fine-scale fractal structure
   characteristics of fault structures and ore deposits in the EGMB, and
   Fry analysis to delineate favorable metallogenic areas. The results show
   that within a scale range of 3.670-58.716 km, the integrated faults
   capacity dimension (CPD) is 1.5095, the information dimension (IND) is
   1.5391, and the correlation dimension (CRD) is 1.5436, indicating fault
   structures with high maturity, which are conducive to the migration and
   accumulation of ore-forming fluids. The multi-fractal spectrum width and
   height are 0.3203 and 1.5355, respectively, implying a significant
   metallogenic potential. The spatial distribution fractal dimensions
   (SDD) of Pb-Zn specifically and metal deposits in general are 1.0193 and
   1.0709, respectively; the quantity distribution fractal dimensions (QDD)
   are 1.4225 and 1.4716, respectively, and the density distribution
   fractal dimensions (DDD) are 1.422 and 1.472, respectively, indicating
   strong clustering. Hence, the favorable metallogenic regions can be
   divided into four grades, among which grade I region is continuously
   distributed in space and has the greatest prospecting potential.},

Title = {Data-Driven Technologies as Enablers for Value Creation in the

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE INFORMATICS RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {7},
Number = {1},
Pages = {1-41},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Despite the advances in modern medicine, the use of data-driven
   technologies (DDTs) to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) remains a
   major challenge. Scholars recognise that data management is the next
   frontier in infection prevention, but many aspects related to the
   benefits and advantages of using DDTs to mitigate SSI risk factors
   remain unclear and underexplored in the literature. This study explores
   how DDTs enable value creation in the prevention of SSIs. This study
   follows a systematic literature review approach and the PRISMA statement
   to analyse peer-reviewed articles from seven databases. Fifty-nine
   articles were included in the review and were analysed through a
   descriptive and a thematic analysis. The findings suggest a growing
   interest in DDTs in SSI prevention in the last 5 years, and that machine
   learning and smartphone applications are widely used in SSI prevention.
   DDTs are mainly applied to prevent SSIs in clean and clean-contaminated
   surgeries and often used to manage patient-related data in the
   postoperative stage. DDTs enable the creation of nine categories of
   value that are classified in four dimensions: cost/sacrifice,
   functional/instrumental, experiential/hedonic, and symbolic/expressive.
   This study offers a unique and systematic overview of the value creation
   aspects enabled by DDT applications in SSI prevention and suggests that
   additional research is needed in four areas: value co-creation and
   product-service systems, DDTs in contaminated and dirty surgeries, data
   legitimation and explainability, and data-driven interventions.},

Title = {A systematic review of the evaluation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals
   in the Japanese medaka (<i>Oryzias latipes</i>) fish},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Month = {NOV 27},
Abstract = {Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) is an acceptable small laboratory fish
   model for the evaluation and assessment of endocrine-disrupting
   chemicals (EDCs) found in the environment. In this research, we used
   this fish as a potential tool for the identification of EDCs that have a
   significant impact on human health. We conducted an electronic search in
   PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Google Scholar
   (https://scholar.google.com/) using the search terms, Japanese medaka,
   Oryzias latipes, and endocrine disruptions, and sorted 205 articles
   consisting of 128 chemicals that showed potential effects on
   estrogen-androgen-thyroid-steroidogenesis (EATS) pathways of Japanese
   medaka. From these chemicals, 14 compounds, namely, 17 beta-estradiol
   (E2), ethinylestradiol (EE2), tamoxifen (TAM), 11-ketotestosterone
   (11-KT), 17 beta-trenbolone (TRB), flutamide (FLU), vinclozolin (VIN),
   triiodothyronine (T3), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA),
   tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), terephthalic acid (TPA), trifloxystrobin
   (TRF), ketoconazole (KTC), and prochloraz (PCZ), were selected as
   references and used for the identification of apical endpoints within
   the EATS modalities. Among these endpoints, during classification,
   priorities are given to sex reversal (masculinization of females and
   feminization of males), gonad histology (testis-ova or ovotestis),
   secondary sex characteristics (anal fin papillae of males), plasma and
   liver vitellogenin (VTG) contents in males, swim bladder inflation
   during larval development, hepatic vitellogenin (vtg) and choriogenin
   (chg) genes in the liver of males, and several genes, including
   estrogen-androgen-thyroid receptors in the
   hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad/thyroid axis (HPG/T). After reviewing 205
   articles, we identified 108 (52.68\%), 46 (22.43\%), 19 (9.26\%), 22
   (17.18\%), and 26 (12.68\%) papers that represented studies on estrogen
   endocrine disruptors (EEDs), androgen endocrine disruptors (AEDs),
   thyroid endocrine disruptors (TEDs), and/or steroidogenesis modulators
   (MOS), respectively. Most importantly, among 128 EDCs, 32 (25\%), 22
   (17.18\%), 15 (11.8\%), and 14 (10.93\%) chemicals were classified as
   EEDs, AEDs, TEDs, and MOS, respectively. We also identified 43 (33.59\%)
   chemicals as high-priority candidates for tier 2 tests, and 13 chemicals
   (10.15\%) show enough potential to be considered EDCs without any
   further tier-based studies. Although our literature search was unable to
   identify the EATS targets of 45 chemicals (35\%) studied in 60 (29.26\%)
   of the 205 articles, our approach has sufficient potential to further
   move the laboratory-based research data on Japanese medaka for
   applications in regulatory risk assessments in humans.},

Abstract = {Hydrogen is one of the most promising renewable energies that has been
   observing rapid development over the past years. Recent accidental
   explosion incidents and the associated damages have demonstrated the
   importance of hydrogen safety against potential explo-sions. This
   article presents a systematic review on hydrogen explosions. Potential
   explo-sion scenarios including the existence of impurities and
   rich-oxygen environment in the production, storage with extreme-high
   pressure and ultra-low temperature, trans-portation, and consumption
   processes are reviewed. Different types of hydrogen-air cloud explosion
   include expansion and deflagration, detonation, and
   deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT). Existing studies on
   hydrogen explosion covering laboratory and field blasting test,
   numerical simulation utilizing various computational approaches, and
   theoretical derivation are reviewed and summarized. CFD modeling is
   currently one of the main research methods because of its cost
   effectiveness, though challenges existing in simulation hydrogen-air
   cloud detonation comparing with testing results. Apart from the
   properties of hydrogen-air cloud such as concentration, size and
   heterogeneity, environ-mental factors such as ignition, ventilation and
   obstacle are found to strongly influence the loading characteristics of
   hydrogen-air cloud explosion. Existing prediction approaches for
   estimating blast loading from hydrogen-air cloud explosion including the
   TNT equivalent method (TNT-EM), TNO multi-energy method (TNO MEM), and
   Baker-Strehlow-Tang method (BST) are primarily empirical based. Because
   of the inherited difference of hydrogen-air cloud from solid explosives
   and conventional flammable gases, the accu-racies of these approaches
   are still doubtable, which requires further study. (c) 2022 Hydrogen

Abstract = {Introduction. Delirium assessment is difficult because it involves the
   alteration of different mental functions in patients of any age who have
   serious medical-surgical conditions or dementia. Therefore, concrete
   assessment tools for specific needs are required. This systematic review
   synthetizes the information about the tools available in Spanish for
   delirium clinical assessment.
   Materials and methods. This is a systematic review that follows the
   PRISMA Diagnostic Test Accuracy guideline. Using a search algorithm, two
   researchers assessed five scientific indexing systems and searched for
   additional papers and grey literature. Other two researchers recorded in
   a standardized way the data of the papers included. The quality of
   translations, cultural adaptations, and validations were assessed.
   Results. We identified 21 reports on translation, cultural adaptation,
   or validation of 14 tools for 1) detailed evaluation, diagnosis, and
   quantification of severity by experts, 2) assessment of concrete aspects
   of delirium, 3) screening in adults, 4) pediatric screening, and 5)
   diagnosis and weighting of severity by treating staff. 78.6\% of
   translations and all adaptations are of good quality. 52.9\% of
   validations have a low risk of bias, 41.2\% have a moderate risk, and
   only 5.9\% have a high risk.
   Conclusions. As the first step to correctly treat patients is an
   accurate diagnosis, and the selection of the appropriate instruments is
   essential for the validity of any study, the available tools should be
   chosen according to the specific clinical and research needs.},

Title = {False-positives and false-negatives in non-invasive prenatal testing
   (NIPT): what can we learn from a meta-analyses on \&gt; 750,000 tests?},
Journal = {MOLECULAR CYTOGENETICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {15},

Month = {AUG 19},
Abstract = {Background Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has had an incomparable
   triumph in prenatal diagnostics in the last decade. Over 1400 research
   articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of
   this test. Methods The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24
   original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the
   efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was
   given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were
   discussed under different aspects-mainly from a patient-perspective.
   Results A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT
   results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive,
   chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90\% of those would have been aborted
   spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under
   aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester
   screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT
   from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children
   born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are
   those never reported in all available NIPT studies? Conclusions Even
   though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures
   concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not
   available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe
   halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low.
   The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions
   are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or
   teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that
   NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the
   problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future.
   Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical
   clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures
   concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT,
   and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative
   NIPT results.},

Title = {Fosfomycin Resistance in Bacteria Isolated from Companion Animals (Dogs
   and Cats)},
Journal = {VETERINARY SCIENCES},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {10},
Number = {5},
Month = {MAY 9},
Abstract = {Simple Summary Fosfomycin is an antibiotic with renewed interest over
   the last years, especially in human medicine, as it possesses some
   advantageous properties and a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity.
   Moreover, the emerging issue of multi-resistance against traditional
   antibiotics obligates specialists to turn to new alternative agents.
   However, cases of Fosfomycin-resistant strains are being detected at a
   rising rate worldwide, among humans and animals. The objective of this
   review is to collect, present and analyze studies related to Fosfomycin
   resistance in isolates from companion animals and specifically dogs and
   cats. Variable articles were collected and data for the relevant strains
   were scanned and evaluated. Since Fosfomycin is an agent not routinely
   used by veterinarians, the detection of Fosfomycin-resistant strains in
   canine and feline samples indicates possible dissemination of these
   strains among humans, pets, and the environment, reinforced by other
   factors. Concerning the origin, the species, and the resistance patterns
   of the related bacteria, useful conclusions were drawn, about the
   presence, the spreading, and possibly the causes of Fosfomycin
   resistance among companion animals and between them and their
   environment. Fosfomycin is an old antibacterial agent, which is
   currently used mainly in human medicine, in uncomplicated Urinary Tract
   Infections (UTIs). The purpose of this review is to investigate the
   presence and the characteristics of Fosfomycin resistance in bacteria
   isolated from canine or feline samples, estimate the possible causes of
   the dissemination of associated strains in pets, and underline the
   requirements of prospective relevant studies. Preferred Reporting Items
   for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search of
   current literature in two databases. A total of 33 articles were finally
   included in the review. Relevant data were tracked down, assembled, and
   compared. Referring to the geographical distribution, Northeast Asia was
   the main area of origin of the studies. E. coli was the predominant
   species detected, followed by other Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococci,
   and Pseudomonas spp. FosA and fosA3 were the more frequently encountered
   Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARGs) in the related Gram-negative
   isolates, while fosB was regularly encountered in Gram-positive ones.
   The majority of the strains were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and
   co-carried resistance genes against several classes of antibiotics and
   especially beta-Lactams, such as bla(CTX-M) and mecA. These results
   demonstrate the fact that the cause of the spreading of
   Fosfomycin-resistant bacteria among pets could be the extended use of
   other antibacterial agents, that promote the prevalence of MDR, epidemic
   strains among an animal population. Through the circulation of these
   strains into a community, a public health issue could arise. Further
   research is essential though, for the comprehensive consideration of the
   issue, as the current data are limited.},

Title = {Distribution and transport of atmospheric microplastics and the
   environmental impacts: A review},

Abstract = {As emerging pollutants, microplastics (MPs) are widely distributed in
   water, soil and atmosphere, and have become a popularly concerned
   environmental and social issue. The research on atmospheric
   microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and
   water, but AMPs' potential environmental impacts are explored in an even
   wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as
   those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the
   distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and
   ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed
   in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban,
   suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were
   detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m(-2) d(-1) or 0 to 1583 n m(-3). The
   distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by
   environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying
   surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the
   diversity of AMPs' shape and composition are higher in the places near
   to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals
   could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the
   production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as
   land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of
   vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What's
   noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities
   of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The
   transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as
   suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology
   of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The
   diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is
   an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs' transport path is
   mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated
   Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and
   their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and
   aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical
   properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality,
   change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals,
   organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport,
   resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect
   atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial
   niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and
   water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved
   scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized
   sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are
   different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information
   comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs' environmental behaviors,
   the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects
   of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory
   researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural
   environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future
   scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research
   methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and
   environmental and ecological impacts.
   It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of
   scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques
   as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and
   could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to
   study the physiological and ecological status of human body and
   ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution.},

Title = {Epigallocatechin-3-gallate ameliorates polystyrene microplastics-induced
   anxiety-like behavior in mice by modulating gut microbe homeostasis},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Abstract = {Polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) have emerged as a concerning
   pollutant in modern society due to their widespread production and
   usage. Despite ongoing research efforts, the impact of PS-MPs on
   mammalian behavior and the mechanisms driving these effects remain
   incompletely elucidated. Consequently, effective strategies for
   prevention have yet to be developed. To fill these gaps, C57BL/6 mice
   were orally administered with 5 \& mu;m PS-MPs for 28 consecutive days
   in this study. The open-field test and the elevated plus-maze test were
   performed to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior, 16S rRNA sequencing and
   untargeted metabolomics analysis were used to detect the changes of gut
   microbiota and serum metabolites. Our results indicated that PS-MPs
   exposure activated hippocampal inflammation and induced anxiety-like
   behavior in mice. Meanwhile, PS-MPs disturbed the gut microbiota,
   impaired the intestinal barrier, and aroused peripheral inflammation.
   Specifically, PS-MPs increased the abundance of pathogenic microbiota
   Tuzzerella, while lowered the abundance of probiotics Faecalibaculum and
   Akkermansia. Interestingly, eliminating the gut microbiota protected
   against the deleterious effects of PS-MPs on intestinal barrier
   integrity, reduced the levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines, and
   ameliorated anxiety-like behavior. Additionally, green tea's primary
   bioactive constituent, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), optimized gut
   microbial composition, improved intestinal barrier function, reduced
   peripheral inflammation, and exerted anti-anxiety effects by inhibiting
   the hippocampal TLR4/MyD88/NF-\& kappa;B signaling cascade. EGCG also
   remodeled serum metabolism, especially modulated purine metabolism.
   These findings suggested that gut microbiota participates in
   PS-MPs-induced anxiety-like behavior by modulating the gut-brain axis,
   and that EGCG could serve as a potential preventive strategy.},

Abstract = {The major goal of this study is to determine the bioaccumulation of
   heavy metals in the tissues and bones of Red Hybrid Tilapia (Oreochromis
   niloticus) and Mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta) taken from two distinct
   sites in Terengganu state, Malaysia, namely Kijal and Paka. Zinc (Zn),
   copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb)were the metals examined. Soil
   analysis also was carried out for the same elements. The tissues and
   bones of the fishes were separated before further analysis was made.
   Drying process technique was used to determine the moisture content for
   all samples at 80 ? for 24 hours. Water content ranged between 70 \&
   77\%. Triplicate samples were evaluated by using Atomic Absorption
   Spectrophotometer (AAS) to find out heavy metals concentration. Oven and
   Teflon beakers were used to fully digest all solid samples at 120 ? for
   3 hours. Highest readings of Zn, Ni and Pb were found in the fish bone
   for the samples collected from both mentioned locations. However,
   different pattern was noticed for Cu where higher values were found in
   the tissues for the same samples. Values of Pb in the tissues were
   higher than the acceptable value in edible fish by Food and Agriculture
   Organization (FAO); 1 ppm and Malaysian Food Act (MFR) \& World Health
   Organization (WHO); 2 ppm, whereas values of Cu, Zn were in the
   acceptable range set by the same organizations. No values recommended
   for Ni by MFR. In general heavy metals in the bones and tissues from
   both locations can be sorted in descending order as follows; Pb > Zn >
   Cu > Ni. Soil samples collected from both locations showed different
   pattern where high concentration was found for Zn followed by Pb then Cu
   and Ni. Moreover analysis for soil samples collected from Paka River
   showed higher content for all elements compared to Kijal. More
   investigation is needed to clarify whether this contamination is solely
   from industry or due to geology of the area.},

Title = {Association between exposure to persistent organic pollutants and
   pubertal timing in boys and girls: A systematic review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {265},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {In recent years, the phenomenon of abnormal pubertal timing in children
   has become increasingly common worldwide. Persistent organic pollutants
   (POPs) may be one of the risk factors contributing to this phenomenon,
   but the relationship between them is unclear based on current evidence.
   The purpose of this study was to determine the association of POPs
   exposure with pubertal timing in girls and boys by conducting a
   systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and Embase
   databases for studies before June 1, 2023. Meta-analysis was performed
   by pooling relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) or prevalence ratio
   (PR) or hazard ratio (HR) estimates with 95 \% confidence intervals
   (CIs). Subgroup analysis, publication bias assessment and sensitivity
   analysis were also carried out. A total of 21 studies were included,
   involving 2479 boys and 8718 girls. The results of meta-analysis showed
   that exposure to POPs was significantly associated with delayed pubertal
   timing in girls (RR: 0.85; 95 \% CI: 0.79-0.91; p < 0.001). There was no
   statistically significant association between exposure to POPs and
   pubertal timing in boys (RR: 1.18; 95 \% CI: 0.99-1.40; p = 0.070).
   Subgroup analysis showed that there may be gender differences in the
   effects of exposure to POPs on pubertal timing. Our results suggested
   that exposure to POPs could delay pubertal timing in girls. However,
   based on current evidence, no significant association was found between
   POPs exposure and pubertal timing in boys.},

Abstract = {In paddy rice farming systems, the degradation of insecticides from the
   soil reduces their occurrence as well as their levels in surface and
   groundwater. Degradation of insecticide fenobucarb in the paddy
   soil-water system was carried out by surface soil collected from paddy
   rice in the Hue province of Vietnam. Experiments were conducted using a
   batch technique, the fenobucarb-spiked paddy soils were shaken
   end-over-end with solutions of pH 7, pH 9, 25 mg L-1 DOC, and 1 critical
   micelle (cmc) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After each period (24, 48,
   72, horizontal ellipsis 144 hours), the soil solutions were separated
   into the aliquot and the solid phase to analyze fenobucarb and
   intermediate metabolic products 2-sec-butyl phenol. The decrease of
   fenobucarb and the appearance of (2-sec-butyl-phenol) were the result of
   hydrolysis and biodegradation by fenobucarb-acclimatized microorganisms
   that were capable of degrading fenobucarb in the paddy soil. The
   degradation of fenobucarb in both the soil and water phases in the paddy
   soil-water system was enhanced in the experiment with pH 7, followed by
   those with pH 9, 25 mg L-1 DOC, and 1 cmc SDS. With pH 9, in addition to
   decomposition by bacteria present in the soil, fenobucarb was hydrolyzed
   under basic conditions. The presence of 25 mg L-1 DOC and 1 cmc SDS in
   the aqueous solution increased desorption and microbial activity in the
   soil and increased the biodegradation efficiency of fenobucarb in the
   paddy soil-water system. However, the degradation of fenobucarb in the 1
   cmc SDS solution was inhibited because SDS solution may be
   preferentially utilized by microorganisms, and fenobucarb would have a
   competitive effect with SDS. Irrigation water for paddy fields often
   receives untreated domestic and industrial wastewater that may contain
   multiple compounds such as DOC and SDS. Therefore, it contributes to the
   elimination of fenobucarb insecticide in the paddy soil-water system.},

Title = {Quantifying metallic components in aerosol filter samples using
   micro-synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence: With quartz filter as an
   example},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},

Abstract = {Metals in atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are presumed to
   have toxic effects. For environmental epidemiological studies, measuring
   the metallic components of PM2.5 collected by personal samplers and
   quartz fiber filters (QFF) has two key advantages: reducing exposure
   misclassification and enabling analyses of multiple (organic and
   inorganic) components on a single filter. We developed a sensitive,
   low-sample-consumption method to quantify the metallic components of
   PM2.5 collected on QFFs using micro-synchrotron radiation Xray
   fluorescence (mu-SRXRF). Teflon filter is used here as a reference to
   test the substrate applicability of QFF. This method requires only a
   5-mm-diameter portion of a QFF and can simultaneously quantify 15 metals
   with atomic numbers Z = 19-34 (i.e., K-Se, excluding Sc). The analysis
   time for each sample was 120-360 s, and the method detection limits were
   0.04-36.6 ng/m3. We validated this method by performing
   cross-comparisons with two external methods: offline inductively coupled
   plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and online X-ray fluorescence (XRF).
   The slopes of the linear fits between the mu-SRXRF and offline ICP-MS
   methods varied from 0.40 to 1, with R2 values ranging from 0.62 to 0.98.
   The slopes of the linear fits between the mu-SRXRF and online XRF
   methods were between 0.29 and 0.89, with R2 values ranging from 0.39 to
   0.80. We applied the proposed method to analyze 391 personal PM2.5
   samples collected in an epidemiological study conducted in urban
   Beijing. By comparing the results with the ambient concentrations from a
   fixed monitoring site, we found that the con-centrations of some
   metallic components in personal PM2.5 samples were significantly
   different from those in the corresponding fixed-site samples, with up to
   an order of magnitude difference. Because personal sampling can reduce
   the potential for exposure misclassifications, the high-resolution
   temporal analysis of metallic compo-nents in personal samples using the
   mu-SRXRF method could be a useful approach for exploring the health
   risks and identifying the sources of metallic components of PM2.5.},

Title = {Integrated bioinformatics and network pharmacology to explore the
   therapeutic target and molecular mechanisms of Bailing capsule on
   polycystic ovary syndrome},

Abstract = {BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine and
   metabolic disorder that is common in women of reproductive age. The
   clinical features of PCOS include hyperandrogenemia and polycystic
   ovarian changes. Bailing capsule (BL), a proprietary Chinese medicine
   that contains fermented Cordyceps sinensis powder, has been applied to
   treat PCOS. However, the specific active ingredients of BL and its
   mechanisms of action are yet to be elucidated.MethodsInitially, the
   effectiveness of BL on PCOS model mice was evaluated. Subsequently, the
   active ingredients of BL were searched in the TCMSP and TCM Systems
   Pharmacology databases, and their targets were predicted using Swiss
   Target Prediction and SEA databases. Furthermore, the GEO gene database
   was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to
   PCOS. Data from Gene Card, OMIM, DDT, and Drugbank databases were then
   combined to establish a PCOS disease gene library. Cross targets were
   imported into the STRING database to construct a protein-protein
   interaction network. In addition, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment
   analyses were performed using Metascape and DAVID databases and
   visualized using Cytoscape software and R 4.2.3. The core targets were
   docked with SYBYL-X software, and their expressions in PCOS mice were
   further verified using qPCR.ResultsThe core active ingredients of BL
   were identified to be linoleyl acetate, cholesteryl palmitate,
   arachidonic acid, among others. Microarray data sets from four groups
   containing disease and normal samples were obtained from the GEO
   database. A total of 491 DEGs and 106 drug-disease cross genes were
   selected. Estrous cycle and ovarian lesions were found to be improved in
   PCOS model mice following BL treatment. While the levels of
   testosterone, progesterone, and prolactin decreased, that of estradiol
   increased. qPCR findings indicated that the expressions of JAK2, PPARG,
   PI3K, and AKT1 were upregulated, whereas those of ESR1 and IRS1 were
   downregulated in PCOS model mice. After the administration of BL, the
   expressions of associated genes were regulated. This study demonstrated
   that BL exerted anti-PCOS effects via PIK3CA, ESR1, AKT, PPARG, and IRS1
   targets affecting PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.DiscussionThis research
   clarified the multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel action of BL

Abstract = {Study designThe diversity of microflora inhabiting endplate (EP) and
   nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues of human intervertebral disc (IVD) was
   profiled through NGS-supported 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Sixteen EP
   and their corresponding NP were excised from the brain-dead voluntary
   organ donors with no clinical history of low back pain, and 12 herniated
   and 8 degenerated NP tissues isolated from the patients undergoing
   spinal surgery were subjected to study the alteration in the microbial
   diversity. Objective(s)To understand in normal IVD, whether the
   colonization of bacteria to the NP is through the EP in discs with
   intact annulus fibrosus. To identify significantly differing microbial
   population(s) between normal and diseased IVD (NP). Background of the
   studyThere is increasing evidence for subclinical infection by
   fastidious low, growing bacteria to be a cause of disc degeneration.
   Although the presence of bacteria in NP has been reported well in
   literature, the source of bacteria is not clearly proved as the disc is
   avascular in healthy condition. Documentation of similar bacterial
   populations in the EP and NP may add proof that bacterial inoculation of
   NP occurs via the EP. Materials and methodsSixteen EP and their
   corresponding NP excised from brain-dead voluntary organ donors with no
   history of back pain and 20 diseased discs collected from patients
   undergoing microdiscectomy/fusion surgery were used for profiling
   microbiome through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing using primers specific
   for V1-V9 hypervariable regions. Changes in bacterial diversity and
   abundance were analysed to identify the key microbial populations in
   normal IVD NP and EP tissues and those significantly altered in diseased
   IVD (NP). ResultsNP and EP shared a similar spectrum of microbiome but
   with varying abundance. The five dominant phyla identified were
   Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, OD1, and Bacteroidetes.
   Proteobacteria was found to be the most abundant phyla in both NP (62\%)
   and EP (53\%) of the normal IVD. This was followed by Firmicutes (16\%),
   Actinobacteriota (11\%), OD1 (Parcubacteria) (7.6\%), and Bacteroidetes
   (2\%) in NP and Firmicutes (23.4\%), OD1 (Parcubacteria) (17.6\%),
   Actinobacteriota (2.8\%), and Bacteroidetes (2.6\%) in EP, respectively.
   Under diseased conditions, Proteobacteria (68\%) was dominant when
   compared with other phyla. However, there was no significant difference
   in the abundance of Proteobacteria between the normal and diseased
   discs. Interestingly, the other dominant phyla such as Firmicutes
   (Normal-NP: 16.2\%; Diseased-NP: 4.02\%) and Actinobacteria (Normal-NP:
   11\%; Diseased-NP: 0.99\%) showed a significant reduction in degenerated
   discs. To understand the key microbial populations that are
   significantly altered during disease, correlation analysis was performed
   among the three phyla, which revealed a negative correlation in the
   ratio of Actinobacteria + Firmicutes vs. Proteobacteria (p = 0.001) in
   DD. ConclusionResults of our study clearly demonstrated a similar
   bacterial diversity but with varying abundance between the EP and NP,
   suggesting the existence of the endplate-nucleus pulposus axis in the
   normal IVD microbiome. Further, our results have indicated that the
   changes in the abundance of Actinobacteria + Firmicutes vs.
   Proteobacteria during DDD need further investigation.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {912},
Month = {FEB 20},
Abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors have been used in various consumer
   and industrial products due to their hydrophobic and oleophobic
   properties. In recent years, PFAA precursors in agricultural soil-plant
   systems have received increasing attention as they are susceptible to
   biotransformation into metabolites with high biotoxicity risks to human
   health. In this review, we systematically assessed the occurrence of
   PFAA precursors in agricultural soils, taking into account their sources
   and biodegradation pathways. In addition, we summarized the findings of
   the relevant literature on the uptake and biotransformation of PFAA
   precursors by agricultural plants. The applications of
   biosolids/composts and pesticides are the main sources of PFAA
   precursors in agricultural soils. The physicochemical properties of PFAA
   precursors, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, and plant species are
   the key factors influencing plant root uptakes of PFAA precursors from
   soils. This review revealed, through toxicity assessment, the potential
   of PFAA precursors to generate metabolites with higher toxicity than the
   parent precursors. The results of this paper provide a reference for
   future research on PFAA precursors and their metabolites in soil-plant
   systems.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},

Month = {NOV 20},
Abstract = {With the increasing incidence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) worldwide and
   no consistent results on PCBs and MetS. A meta-analysis to explore their
   relationship was conducted. Given the high correlation and overlap of
   MetS with diabetes, analysis of diabetes risk, was used as a supplement
   to compare with MetS. Seven studies included MetS, 15 studies for
   diabetes, and one study included both outcomes. It was found that PCBs
   may not be a risk factor for MetS, but their high heterogeneity
   indicates that they are under-represented. In addition, our results
   showed that total PCBs might be a protective factor against diabetes. In
   the whole blood subgroup, which can reflect the accumulation of more
   than one body load, heterogeneity was reduced, and its OR value
   suggested that PCBs increased the risk of MetS in the whole blood
   biomaterial. DL-PCBs were positively associated with MetS and diabetes,
   while NDL-PCBs were negatively associated with diabetes. In the subgroup
   analysis of PCBs homologs, DL-PCB-126 and DL-PCB-118 were risk factors
   for MetS and diabetes, respectively. In addition, PCB153 and 180 showed
   a dose-response relationship between them and diabetes mellitus,
   respectively. The results of total analysis of MetS and diabetes
   mellitus and subgroup analysis of PCBs were mixed, and this reason might
   be attributed to the different mechanisms of action and effect sizes of
   different PCBs, so based on subgroup results and in vivo and in vitro
   experiments, we considered PCBs to be a risk factor for MetS and
   diabetes. Due to various reasons, there are still many shortcomings in
   the evaluation of PCBs impact on human health, and more high-quality
   research are needed to further explore the role of PCBs of different
   species and congeners in MetS and diabetes.},

Abstract = {The effects of environmental pollution are associated with higher rates
   of mortality, morbidity, and years of life lost. It is known that these
   produce alterations in the human body, including changes in body
   composition. Research has focused on the association between
   contaminants and BMI through cross-sectional studies. The objective of
   this study was to synthesize the evidence for the association of
   pollutants on different measures of body composition. The PECOS strategy
   was defined, in which ``P{''}: participants of any age, sex, or
   ethnicity, ``E{''}: a higher level of environmental pollution, ``C{''}:
   a lower level of environmental pollution, ``O{''}: body composition
   measurements and ``S{''}: longitudinal studies. Studies from the
   following databases were included: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciELO, LILACS,
   Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and gray literature from inception
   to January 2023.3069 studies were identified, 18 were included in the
   systematic review, and 13 in the meta-analysis. These studies included
   8.563 people, 47 environmental contaminants, and 16 measures of body
   composition. The meta -analysis by subgroup found that the association
   between dioxins, furans, PCBs, and waist circumference was beta = 1.0

Abstract = {Exposure to pesticides has been proposed to be a positive association in
   suicide and suicidality. Many studies have explored this topic, but have
   reported inconsistent findings. We carried out a systematic review and
   metaanalysis of the now existing evidence on the association between
   pesticide exposure and the risk of suicide and suicidality. We searched
   PubMed, EMBASE and Web of Science databases for studies published up to
   February 1, 2023. For studies that provided detailed data, we applied
   quantitative meta-analysis to calculate Odds ratio (OR) with 95\%
   Confidence Intervals (CIs) to evaluate the results. Heterogeneity among
   the included studies was assessed using Cochran's Q test, I2 statistic
   and tau-squared (tau 2). Publication bias was evaluated by funnel plots,
   Egger's test, and Begg's test. In addition, subgroup analyses according
   to pesticides category and geographical area were performed. 2906
   studies were initially identified, and 20 studies were eventually
   included. Fifteen of the studies were on suicide deaths and suicide
   attempts, and five were on suicidal ideation. Pesticide exposure was
   positively related to suicide deaths and suicide attempts (pooled OR =
   1.31; 95\%CI: 1.04-1.64, p < 0.001) and suicidal ideation (pooled OR =
   2.43; 95\%CI: 1.51-3.91, p = 0.015). In the subgroup analysis, mixed
   pesticide type (pooled OR = 1.55; 95\%CI: 1.39-1.74) increased the risk
   of suicide deaths and suicide attempts. The results of the analysis by
   geographic area showed that the risk of suicide deaths and suicide
   attempts with pesticide exposure was 2.27 (95\%CI = 1.36-3.78), and 1.33
   (95\%CI = 1.14-1.56) in Asia and Europe, respectively. The risk of
   suicidal ideation caused by pesticide exposure in Asia and America were
   2.19 (95\%CI = 1.08-4.42) and 2.99 (95\%CI = 1.76-5.06). In conclusion,
   pesticide exposure may increase the risk of suicide and suicidality
   based on the current evidence.},

Abstract = {Background: Infertility is a global health problem that represents an
   increasing trend due to new lifestyles following technological advances
   since individuals are facing more risk factors than before. The present
   systematic review study aimed to investigate the impact of environmental
   and occupational factors on reproductive parameters and increased risk
   of couple infertility. Main body: Scopus, PubMed, SID, and Web of
   Science databases were searched for the available observational (i.e.,
   cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional) systematic review,
   meta-analysis, and clinical trial studies between 2007 and 2019. To this
   end, keywords such as `Environmental exposure', `Occupational exposure',
   `Environmental pollutants', `Environmental pollution', `Couple
   infertility', `Sterility', and `Sub-fertility' were used. The retrieved
   investigations examined the impact of environmental and occupational
   risk factors on reproductive indices and increased infertility risk.
   Totally, 66 out of 9519 papers were evaluated after considering the
   inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reported risk factors in the
   reviewed studies were heavy metals, cigarette smoking, and exposure to
   chemicals through consumer goods, urban life, and proximity to main
   roads. In addition, occupational factors included heavy physical
   activity, prolonged sitting, exposure to a hot environment, contact with
   formaldehyde, pesticides, insecticides, mechanical vibration, and
   contact with ionizing radiation, all of which affected the reproductive
   parameters. However, some researchers found no significant associations
   in this regard. Short conclusion: In general, individuals with known
   impairments in reproductive parameters were more exposed to risk
   factors. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to determine the risk of
   infertility in the population.},

Abstract = {Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common
   postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an
   increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters,
   resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes.
   The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can
   lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together,
   these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression.
   This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and
   consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5].
   Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further
   overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and
   reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial
   anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding
   dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6].
   This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine
   micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and
   urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as
   perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical
   bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may
   involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the
   pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and
   continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other
   lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the
   urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes
   may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic
   consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention
   (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to
   identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide
   range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9].
   This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including
   most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management
   protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United
   States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for
   PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide
   variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main
   subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present
   with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including
   low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy
   to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional
   findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in
   lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired
   ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the
   definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A
   multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain
   individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening
   protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR,
   postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary
   retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS,
   obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead
   to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of
   the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has
   shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also
   reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after
   delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating
   and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early
   diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the
   literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and
   impaired diagnosis.
   While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most
   common established in the literature, it is notable that there is
   variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The
   most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse
   outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml
   may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may
   be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR
   cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the
   literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used
   transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly
   known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.
   1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving
   formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider
   education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that
   trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive
   of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal
   training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study
   audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum,
   recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and
   postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous
   voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the
   study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after
   delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9].
   This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33].
   Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary
   fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the
   increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine
   segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor
   visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind
   these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also
   highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery
   embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these
   scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if
   patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal
   leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling
   in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon
   test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal.
   Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also
   important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and
   ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common
   sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods.
   Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using
   standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient
   and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury.
   Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery.
   Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is
   often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients
   between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding
   the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life,
   psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of
   the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common
   in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2].
   These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the
   postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As
   such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to
   prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption
   availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in
   the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these
   dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone
   may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system
   smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes
   include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the
   ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder
   volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression
   and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4].
   Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues
   a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent
   postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose
   some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well.
   Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable
   bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury,
   causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation
   associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may
   lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may
   in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15].
   Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with
   PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed
   with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay
   between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan
   use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly
   higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the
   bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during
   recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to
   a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life.
   Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular
   acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence,
   encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a
   significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact
   32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year
   postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally.
   Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT
   regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3,
   including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency
   and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased
   strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT
   exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated

   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an
   increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters,
   resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes.
   The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can
   lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together,
   these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.
   Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some
   individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical
   forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder
   descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing
   neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated
   with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a
   vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn
   result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals
   and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals
   to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and
   other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of
   the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these
   outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their
   physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary
   retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more
   nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon
   with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to
   45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons,
   including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and
   management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of
   United States labor and delivery institutions have an established
   protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to
   a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three
   main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may
   present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients,
   including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or
   hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario,
   additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height
   and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to
   impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by
   the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A
   multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain
   individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening
   protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR,
   postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary
   retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS,
   obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead
   to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of
   the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has
   shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also
   reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after
   delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating
   and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early
   diagnosis is essential in PUR management.
   The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to
   decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously
   described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the
   literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific
   postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off
   remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this
   volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate
   bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant,
   150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of
   measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review
   of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or
   ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to
   measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12].
   While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is
   evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy
   with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between
   measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound
   is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer
   {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first
   using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is
   identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is
   also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following
   delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section,
   removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased
   the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h
   postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased
   the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized
   controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant
   shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no
   difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two
   management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.
   Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed
   Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR
   training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18].
   Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to
   identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional
   auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.
   When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related
   vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in
   developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged
   obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case
   reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas
   including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing
   incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in
   conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the
   vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas
   {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted
   genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for
   postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare,
   genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with
   atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These
   typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina
   on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be
   helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional
   imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important
   given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and
   ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common
   sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods.
   Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using
   standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient
   and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury.
   Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.
   Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of
   review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis
   on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient
   patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first
   12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term
   sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum
   pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with
   studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were
   the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with
   decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient
   embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom
   distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients
   reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite
   ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention
   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and
   other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of
   the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these
   outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their
   physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary
   retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more
   nuanced to identify.
   PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of
   incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large
   variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most
   importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management
   protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United
   States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for
   PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide
   variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main
   subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present
   with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including
   low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy
   to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional
   findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in
   lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired
   ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the
   definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A
   multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain
   individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening
   protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR,
   postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary
   retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS,
   obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead
   to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of
   the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has
   shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also
   reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after
   delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating
   and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early
   diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the
   literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and
   impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table
   1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that
   there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs
   {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent
   adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above
   200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100
   ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal
   PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the
   literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used
   transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly
   known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery.
   A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of
   urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk
   of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was
   associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first
   ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found
   patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR
   resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or
   length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A
   study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum
   found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the
   toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral
   modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration
   of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of
   patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that
   may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized
   protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would
   therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented
   postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first
   two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure
   appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when
   and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application.
   Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of
   bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored
   for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and
   excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR
   should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of
   acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the
   vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture
   postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR
   {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed
   subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life
   {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of
   individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for
   postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of
   labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger
   fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as
   intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery,
   limited research exists regarding prevention and management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a
   majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI)
   antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year
   postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value
   {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for
   urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence
   is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30].
   This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during
   their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of
   attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found
   additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by
   Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk.
   Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an
   increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters,
   resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes.
   The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can
   lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together,
   these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and
   other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of
   the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these
   outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their
   physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary
   retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more
   nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon
   with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to
   45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons,
   including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and
   management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of
   United States labor and delivery institutions have an established
   protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to
   a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three
   main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may
   present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients,
   including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or
   hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario,
   additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height
   and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to
   impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by
   the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A
   multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain
   individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening
   protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR,
   postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary
   retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS,
   obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead
   to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of
   the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3].
   Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve,
   with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at
   intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the
   importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized
   recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR
   management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR
   likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the
   previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved.
   This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and
   outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while
   admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to
   include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared
   decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the
   protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its
   algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management
   protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology
   residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for
   improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the
   likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical
   scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses
   overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR
   {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids
   intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the
   intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two
   adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies
   were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and
   the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare
   provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and
   managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving
   patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important
   strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for
   the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder
   muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in
   bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac,
   pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad
   application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding
   the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be
   monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea,
   lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic
   management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also
   examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of
   Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving
   acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against
   PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed
   subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life
   {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of
   individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for
   postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of
   labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger
   fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as
   intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery,
   limited research exists regarding prevention and management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a
   majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI)
   antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year
   postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value
   {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for
   urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence
   is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.
   Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized
   identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that
   providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence
   complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no
   postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple
   questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''}
   may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.
   In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary
   incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or
   referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future
   considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order
   to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's
   convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence,
   obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered.
   Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of
   prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery
   {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other
   genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting
   of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower
   uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor
   visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind
   these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also
   highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery
   embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these
   scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if
   patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal
   leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling
   in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon
   test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal.
   Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also
   important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and
   ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common
   sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods.
   Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using
   standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient
   and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury.
   Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to

   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and
   other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of
   the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3].
   While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum
   care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to
   postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis
   that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common
   postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature,
   ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a
   variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized
   definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only
   approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have
   an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby
   contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically
   {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1.
   Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric
   postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria,
   suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific
   clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal
   exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal
   bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3].
   As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be
   asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may
   predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed
   if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum
   urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for
   postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight
   catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly,
   mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including
   noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture
   {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to
   resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction
   at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the
   importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized
   recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR
   management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR
   likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the
   previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14].
   Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using
   bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is
   identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is
   also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following
   delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section,
   removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased
   the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h
   postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased
   the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized
   controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant
   shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no
   difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two
   management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise

   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from

   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered

   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder

   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,

   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force

   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear

   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated

   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise

   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management.
   Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow
   providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its
   repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary
   incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such
   as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of
   particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have
   been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum
   obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education
   and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after
   giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated
   with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor
   disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding
   that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least
   proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased
   quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient
   embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom
   distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients
   reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite
   ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention
   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and

   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management.
   Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow
   providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its
   repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary
   incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such
   as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of
   particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have
   been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum
   obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education
   and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after
   giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated
   with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor
   disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding
   that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least
   proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased
   quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient
   embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom
   distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients
   reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite
   ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention
   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and

   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early

   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management.
   Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow
   providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its
   repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary
   incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such
   as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of
   particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have
   been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum
   obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education
   and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after
   giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated
   with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor
   disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding
   that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least
   proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased
   quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient
   embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom
   distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients
   reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite
   ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention
   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to

   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral

   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary

   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise

   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from

   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all

   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder

   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR

   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent

   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force

   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear

   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.

   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management.
   Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow
   providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its
   repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary
   incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such
   as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of
   particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have
   been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum
   obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education
   and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after
   giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated
   with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor
   disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding
   that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least
   proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased
   quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient
   embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom
   distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients
   reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite
   ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention
   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and

   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management.
   Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow
   providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its
   repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary
   incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such
   as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of
   particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have
   been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum
   obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education
   and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after
   giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated
   with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor
   disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding
   that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least
   proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased
   quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient
   embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom
   distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients
   reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite
   ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention
   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and

   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in

   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management.
   Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow
   providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its
   repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary
   incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such
   as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of
   particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have
   been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum
   obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education
   and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after
   giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated
   with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor
   disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding
   that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least
   proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased
   quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient
   embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom
   distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients
   reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite
   ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention
   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to

   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral

   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary

   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith

   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the

   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,

   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered

   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early

   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine

   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent

   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force

   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical

   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all

   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.

   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols
   postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary
   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management.
   Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow
   providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its
   repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary
   incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such
   as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of
   particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have
   been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum
   obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education
   and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after
   giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated
   with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor
   disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding
   that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least
   proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased
   quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient
   embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom
   distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients
   reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite
   ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention
   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and

   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to
   describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary
   retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by
   providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment
   of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and
   management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum
   population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this
   condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary
   incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more
   challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and
   over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic
   floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve
   symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary
   disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate
   diagnosis and management.
   Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow
   providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its
   repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary
   incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such
   as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of
   particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have
   been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum
   obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education
   and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after
   giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated
   with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor
   disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding
   that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least
   proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased
   quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient
   embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom
   distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients
   reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite
   ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention
   and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to
   educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum
   urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes
   associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying
   mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted.
   Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral
   pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired
   detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in
   glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in
   increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging
   gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary
   frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these
   genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common
   phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of
   the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the
   development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing
   cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and
   compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic
   dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with
   bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious
   cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in
   continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other
   forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to
   postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder
   innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the
   ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle
   contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth
   processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may
   cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of
   birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury
   involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect
   sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term
   repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle
   and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take
   up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged
   voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These
   findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also
   recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be
   broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a
   patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of
   outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling
   catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority
   of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that
   pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and
   development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated
   with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on
   patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29].
   The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may
   also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal
   PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI
   are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.
   Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate
   postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during
   recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows
   for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces
   the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary
   incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of
   conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and
   provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder
   complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum
   care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the
   common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and
   incontinence, and to summarize the management of these
   conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in
   obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by

   retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education
   regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early
   management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality
   of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual
   period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large
   emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be
   insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester,
   or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and
   long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about
   peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during
   pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and
   39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are
   associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a
   sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs,
   urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\%
   of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at
   opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary
   retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article
   is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage
   postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system
   changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The
   underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are
   multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to
   decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle
   and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3].
   Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and
   dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and
   functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to
   bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and
   incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make
   bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some,
   persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to
   predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as
   well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with
   inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular
   injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished
   sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder
   sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of
   the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor
   contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also
   predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to
   disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption
   consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition
   center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter
   relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema,
   advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet
   obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani
   muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and
   pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8].
   Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair
   reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and
   periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified
   during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also
   predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary
   dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a
   relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence
   in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance
   is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the
   lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.
   Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and
   delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation
   and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR
   recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR,
   outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms
   similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine
   output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void
   {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings
   may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral
   displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for
   the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of
   covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk
   factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR.
   As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in
   place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary
   retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC,
   intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter
   injuries.
   Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions,
   including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder
   rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42
   days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding
   dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings
   stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of
   standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential
   in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding
   PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While
   the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common
   established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in
   the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common
   PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with
   using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect
   inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal
   variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The
   route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A
   systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal
   ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a
   bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent
   self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be
   convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the
   postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to
   discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13].
   Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and
   requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise
   standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then
   performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent
   unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of
   indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients
   who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater
   than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while
   removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk
   of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely,
   a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had
   significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC,
   with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the
   two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus
   mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher
   micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan
   {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery
   can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a
   patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on
   good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent
   bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that
   presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate
   evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder
   protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous
   voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate
   bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how
   PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is
   diagnosed.
   Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to
   ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly
   utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's
   symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient
   management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter
   after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR
   cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into
   postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to
   follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of
   surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal
   PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education
   {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were
   able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An
   additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on
   identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria
   such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid
   input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and
   ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery.
   After educational strategies were implemented, the study found
   reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery
   {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is
   effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding
   patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient
   management remains the most important strategy for PUR management.
   However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20].
   Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which
   increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20].
   However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal
   adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no
   established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while
   breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic
   excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive
   urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be
   prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture
   and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force
   of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and
   auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary
   incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to
   have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to
   impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first
   year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence
   include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery,
   increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].
   While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid
   uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding
   prevention and management of postpartum urinary
   incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of
   patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8
   weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting
   the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26].
   With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary
   incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is
   strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of
   postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has
   on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks
   standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have
   found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary
   incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally,
   there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28].
   Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of
   urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid
   over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This
   education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary
   incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not
   every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also
   lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary
   incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence
   management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral
   modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of
   including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining
   appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed
   voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a
   first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary
   incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and
   postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted
   that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy
   and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in
   patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for
   PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be
   cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT
   continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence
   {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT
   during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the
   cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also
   found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested
   by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved
   sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving
   labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control
   of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise
   prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith
   {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well
   tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients.
   Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary
   incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific
   postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as
   6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient
   could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from
   the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the
   discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such
   as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an
   option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is
   breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms
   postpartum.
   Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are
   typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy,
   traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care
   providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer
   either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical
   therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize
   telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding
   patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating
   postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal
   fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries,
   VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often
   present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a
   higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine
   fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections
   {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive
   disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely
   the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case
   reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of
   uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all
   of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered
   if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear
   vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine
   pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye
   tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are
   equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT)
   urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent
   vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction
   is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth
   trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR
   risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the
   outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder
   injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early
   identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT.
   Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to
   raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated
   in postpartum care.None.},

Title = {Lead exposure is related to higher infection rate with the gapeworm in
   Norwegian house sparrows<i> (Passer</i><i> domesticus)</i>},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {344},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Anthropogenic pollution is identified as an important threat to bird and
   other wildlife populations. Many metals and toxic elements, along with
   poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known to induce
   immunomodulation and have previously been linked to increased pathogen
   prevalence and infectious disease severity. In this study, the house
   sparrow (Passer domesticus) was investigated at the coast of Helgeland
   in northern Norway. This population is commonly infected with the
   parasitic nematode ``gapeworm{''} (Syngamus trachea), with a prevalence
   of 40-60 \% during summer months. Gapeworm induces severe respiratory
   disease in birds and has been previously demonstrated to decrease
   survival and reproductive success in wild house sparrows. The aim of
   this study was to investigate whether a higher exposure to pollution
   with PFASs, metals and other elements influences gapeworm infection in
   wild house sparrows. We conducted PFASs and elemental analysis on whole
   blood from 52 house sparrows from Helgeland, including analyses of
   highly toxic metals such as lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As). In
   addition, we studied gapeworm infection load by counting the parasite
   eggs in faeces from each individual. We also studied the expression of
   microRNA 155 (miR155) as a key regulator in the immune system. Elevated
   blood concentrations of Pb were found to be associated with an increased
   prevalence of gapeworm infection in the house sparrow. The expression of
   miR155 in the plasma of the house sparrow was only weakly associated
   with Pb. In contrast, we found relatively low PFASs concentrations in
   the house sparrow blood ( n-ary sumation PFASs 0.00048-354 mu g/L) and
   PFASs were not associated to miR155 nor infection rate. The current
   study highlights the potential threat posed by Pb as an immunotoxic
   pollutant in small songbirds.},

Journal = {LANCET PLANETARY HEALTH},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {8},

Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Background Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are classed as
   endocrine disrupting compounds but continue to be used in many products
   such as firefighting foams, flame retardants, utensil coatings, and
   waterproofing of food packaging. Perfluoroalkyl exposure aberrantly
   modulates lipid, metabolite, and bile acid levels, increasing
   susceptibility to onset and severity of metabolic diseases, such as
   diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.
   To date, most studies in humans have focused on perfluoroalkyl-exposure
   effects in adults. In this study we aimed to show if perfluoroalkyls are
   present in the human fetal liver and if they have metabolic consequences
   for the human fetus. Methods In this cross-sectional study, human fetal
   livers from elective termination of pregnancies at the Aberdeen
   Pregnancy Counselling Service, Aberdeen, UK, were analysed by both
   targeted (bile acids and perfluoroalkyl substances) and combined
   targeted and untargeted (lipids and polar metabolites) mass spectrometry
   based metabolomic analyses, as well as with RNA-Seq. Only fetuses from
   normally progressing pregnancies (determined at ultrasound scan before
   termination), terminated for non-medical reasons, from women older than
   16 years, fluent in English, and between 11 and 21 weeks of gestation
   were collected. Women exhibiting considerable emotional distress or
   whose fetuses had anomalies identified at ultrasound scan were excluded.
   Stringent bioinformatic and statistical methods such as partial
   correlation network analysis, linear regression, and pathway analysis
   were applied to this data to investigate the association of
   perfluoroalkyl exposure with hepatic metabolic pathways. Findings
   Fetuses included in this study were collected between Dec 2, 2004, and
   Oct 27, 2014. 78 fetuses were included in the study: all 78 fetuses were
   included in the metabolomics analysis (40 female and 38 male) and 57
   fetuses were included in the RNA-Seq analysis (28 female and 29 male).
   Metabolites associated with perfluoroalkyl were identified in the fetal
   liver and these varied with gestational age. Conjugated bile acids were
   markedly positively associated with fetal age. 23 amino acids, fatty
   acids, and sugar derivatives in fetal livers were inversely associated
   with perfluoroalkyl exposure, and the bile acid glycolithocholic acid
   was markedly positively associated with all quantified perfluoroalkyl.
   Furthermore, 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, a marker of bile acid
   synthesis rate, was strongly positively associated with perfluoroalkyl
   levels and was detectable as early as gestational week 12.
   Interpretation Our study shows direct evidence for the in utero effects
   of perfluoroalkyl exposure on specific key hepatic products. Our results
   provide evidence that perfluoroalkyl exposure, with potential future
   consequences, manifests in the human fetus as early as the first
   trimester of gestation. Furthermore, the profiles of metabolic changes
   resemble those observed in perinatal perfluoroalkyl exposures. Such
   exposures are already linked with susceptibility, initiation,
   progression, and exacerbation of a wide range of metabolic diseases.

Title = {A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis of Chemical Exposures and
   Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder in Children},
Journal = {PREVENTION SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 DEC 18},
Abstract = {Exposure to certain chemicals prenatally and in childhood can impact
   development and may increase risk for attention-deficit/hyperactivity
   disorder (ADHD). Leveraging a larger set of literature searches
   conducted to synthesize results from longitudinal studies of potentially
   modifiable risk factors for childhood ADHD, we present meta-analytic
   results from 66 studies that examined the associations between early
   chemical exposures and later ADHD diagnosis or symptoms. Studies were
   eligible for inclusion if the chemical exposure occurred at least 6
   months prior to measurement of ADHD diagnosis or symptomatology.
   Included papers were published between 1975 and 2019 on exposure to
   anesthetics (n = 5), cadmium (n = 3), hexachlorobenzene (n = 4), lead (n
   = 22), mercury (n = 12), organophosphates (n = 7), and polychlorinated
   biphenyls (n = 13). Analyses are presented for each chemical exposure by
   type of ADHD outcome reported (categorical vs. continuous), type of ADHD
   measurement (overall measures of ADHD, ADHD symptoms only, ADHD
   diagnosis only, inattention only, hyperactivity/impulsivity only), and
   timing of exposure (prenatal vs. childhood vs. cumulative), whenever at
   least 3 relevant effect sizes were available. Childhood lead exposure
   was positively associated with ADHD diagnosis and symptoms in all
   analyses except for the prenatal analyses (odds ratios (ORs) ranging
   from 1.60 to 2.62, correlation coefficients (CCs) ranging from 0.14 to
   0.16). Other statistically significant associations were limited to
   organophosphates (CC = 0.11, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.19
   for continuous measures of ADHD outcomes overall), polychlorinated
   biphenyls (CC = 0.08, 95\% CI: 0.02-0.14 for continuous measures of
   inattention as the outcome), and both prenatal and childhood mercury
   exposure (CC = 0.02, 95\% CI: 0.00-0.04 for continuous measures of ADHD
   outcomes overall for either exposure window). Our findings provide
   further support for negative impacts of prenatal and/or childhood
   exposure to certain chemicals and raise the possibility that primary
   prevention and targeted screening could prevent or mitigate ADHD
   symptomatology. Furthermore, these findings support the need for regular
   review of regulations as our scientific understanding of the risks posed
   by these chemicals evolves.},

   natural hormones. They can have adverse effects on the morphology,
   physiology, growth, and development of different organs and systems,
   among these bone health can be affected too. EDCs work as agonists or
   antagonists on hormonal receptors in hormone-sensitive cells, influence
   gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms, stimulate or inhibit cell
   maturation, and affect the synthesis and metabolism of hormones. This
   review aims to summarize current evidence on the effects of exposure to
   EDCs on bone from early gestational to birth and long-term adverse
   effects. Single and mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals can
   disrupt bone structure by modifying differentiation, increasing
   osteoclast activity, inhibiting pre-osteoblasts differentiation into
   mature osteoblasts and osteocytes, inducing changes in signaling
   pathways downstream of receptors, and ultimately remodeling and
   modifying the equilibrium between bone resorption and formation leading
   to increased bone resorption, morphological, and functional changes in
   bone maturation. EDCs can affect the IGF system, alkaline phosphatase,
   and osteocalcin gene expression. Findings are relative to both in vitro
   and in vivo studies. Studies have shown that prenatal exposure to EDCs
   leads to growth retardation, delayed ossification, and changes in bone
   length and size and in bone geometry with a lowering of bone mineral
   density and area-adjusted bone mineral content. Current knowledge on
   bone health, growth, mineral content, and development from molecular to
   clinical findings highlights how endocrine-disrupting chemicals can
   negatively affect these processes. Mechanisms, however, are not fully
   understood and need further investigation.},

Abstract = {BackgroundEarly life exposure to lead, mercury, polychlorinated
   biphenyls (PCBs), polybromide diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), organophosphate
   pesticides (OPPs), and phthalates have been associated with lowered IQ
   in children. In some studies, these neurotoxicants impact males and
   females differently. We aimed to examine the sex-specific effects of
   exposure to developmental neurotoxicants on intelligence (IQ) in a
   systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodWe screened abstracts
   published in PsychINFO and PubMed before December 31st, 2021, for
   empirical studies of six neurotoxicants (lead, mercury, PCBs, PBDEs,
   OPPs, and phthalates) that (1) used an individualized biomarker; (2)
   measured exposure during the prenatal period or before age six; and (3)
   provided effect estimates on general, nonverbal, and/or verbal IQ by
   sex. We assessed each study for risk of bias and evaluated the certainty
   of the evidence using Navigation Guide. We performed separate random
   effect meta-analyses by sex and timing of exposure with subgroup
   analyses by neurotoxicant.ResultsFifty-one studies were included in the
   systematic review and 20 in the meta-analysis. Prenatal exposure to
   developmental neurotoxicants was associated with decreased general and
   nonverbal IQ in males, especially for lead. No significant effects were
   found for verbal IQ, or postnatal lead exposure and general IQ. Due to
   the limited number of studies, we were unable to analyze postnatal
   effects of any of the other neurotoxicants.ConclusionDuring fetal
   development, males may be more vulnerable than females to general and
   nonverbal intellectual deficits from neurotoxic exposures, especially
   from lead. More research is needed to examine the nuanced sex-specific
   effects found for postnatal exposure to toxic chemicals.},

Title = {The plastic health map: A systematic evidence map of human health
   studies on plastic-associated chemicals},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {181},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Background: The global production and use of plastic materials has
   increased dramatically since the 1960s and there is increasing evidence
   of human health impacts related to exposure to plastic-associated
   chemicals. There is, however, no comprehensive, regulatory, post-market
   monitoring for human health effects of plastic-associated chemicals or
   particles and it is unclear how many of these have been investigated for
   effects in humans, and therefore what the knowledge gaps are. Objective:
   To create a systematic evidence map of peer-reviewed human studies
   investigating the potential effects of exposure to plastic-associated
   particles/chemicals on health to identify research gaps and provide
   recommendations for future research and regulation policy. Methods:
   Medline and Embase databases were used to identify peer-reviewed primary
   human studies published in English from Jan 1960 - Jan 2022 that
   investigated relationships between exposures to included
   plasticassociated particles/chemicals measured and detected in
   bio-samples and human health outcomes. Plasticassociated
   particles/chemicals included are: micro and nanoplastics, due to their
   widespread occurrence and potential for human exposure; polymers, the
   main building blocks of plastic; plasticizers and flame retardants, the
   two most common types of plastic additives with the highest
   concentration ranges in plastic materials; and bisphenols and per- or
   polyfluoroalkyl substances, two chemical classes of known health concern
   that are common in plastics. We extracted metadata on the population and
   study characteristics (country, intergenerational, sex, age,
   general/special exposure risk status, study design), exposure
   (plastic-associated particle/ chemical, multiple exposures), and health
   outcome measures (biochemical, physiological, and/or clinical), from
   which we produced the interactive database `Plastic Health Map' and a
   narrative summary. Results: We identified 100,949 unique articles, of
   which 3,587 met our inclusion criteria and were used to create a
   systematic evidence map. The Plastic Health Map with extracted metadata
   from included studies are freely available at https://osf.io/fhw7d/ and
   summary tables, plots and overall observations are included in this
   report. Conclusions: We present the first evidence map compiling human
   health research on a wide range of plasticassociated chemicals from
   several different chemical classes, in order to provide stakeholders,
   including researchers, regulators, and concerned individuals, with an
   efficient way to access published literature on the matter and determine
   knowledge gaps. We also provide examples of data clusters to facilitate
   systematic reviews and research gaps to help direct future research
   efforts. Extensive gaps are identified in the breadth of populations,
   exposures and outcomes addressed in studies of potential human health
   effects of plastic-associated chemicals. No studies of the human health
   effects of micro and/or nanoplastics were found, and no studies were
   found for 26/1,202 additives included in our search that are of known
   hazard concern and confirmed to be in active production. Few studies
   have addressed recent ``substitution{''} chemicals for restricted
   additives such as organophosphate flame retardants, phthalate
   substitutes, and bisphenol analogues.
   We call for a paradigm shift in chemical regulation whereby new plastic
   chemicals are rigorously tested for safety before being introduced in
   consumer products, with ongoing post-introduction biomonitoring of their
   levels in humans and health effects throughout individuals' life span,
   including in old age and across generations.},

Abstract = {PurposesTo investigate the incidence and factors influencing the
   occurrence of metamorphopsia in patients with simple rhegmatogenous
   retinal detachment (RRD) after surgery.MethodsRelevant studies of
   metamorphopsia were identified by searching in PubMed, Embase, and
   Cochrane until August 2022. Meta-analysis of the incidence of
   metamorphopsia after rhegmatogenous retinal detachment surgery was
   performed using Review Manager 5.4 statistical software.ResultsA total
   of 12 studies reported 1133 participants with 469 patients with
   postoperative metamorphopsia. The meta-analysis showed a higher
   incidence of metamorphopsia in macular-off cases compared with
   macular-on RRD (RR = 2.88, 95\% CI: 2.35 to 3.52). The use of
   perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) during pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) reduced
   the incidence of metamorphopsia (RR = 0.61, 95\% CI: 0.41 to 0.92).
   There was no evidence of any important difference in metamorphopsia
   between participants in the PPV group and the scleral buckling (SB)
   group (RR = 1.04, 95\% CI: 0.82 to 1.33). There was little or no
   difference in metamorphopsia between gas and silicon oil (SO) in the PPV
   group (RR = 0.89, 95\% CI: 0.69 to 1.13).ConclusionThe incidence of
   postoperative metamorphopsia is higher in macular-off RRD, and PFCL
   should be a preferred choice to prevent postoperative metamorphopsia in
   macula-off RRD cases.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND POLLUTION RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 OCT 12},
Abstract = {Although heritability estimates suggest a role for genetic components,
   environmental risk factors have been described as relevant in the
   etiology of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Several
   studies have investigated the role of toxicological pollution, i.e., air
   pollution, heavy metals, POPs, and phthalates. Clear evidence for
   association of ADHD and environmental factors has not been provided yet.
   To answer this, we have assessed all available systematic reviews and
   meta-analyses that focused on the association between pollutant exposure
   and either ADHD diagnosis or symptoms. More than 1800 studies were
   screened of which 14 found eligible. We found evidence of a significant
   role for some pollutants, in particular heavy metals and phthalates, in
   the increased risk of developing ADHD symptoms. However, at the current
   stage, data from existing literature also do not allow to weight the
   role of the different environmental pollutants. We also offer a critical
   examination of the reviews/meta-analyses and provide indications for
   future studies in this field. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022341496},

Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {23},
Number = {1},
Month = {SEP 26},
Abstract = {BackgroundKnowledge surrounding the association between exposure to
   pesticides and hypothyroidism is inconsistent and
   controversial.MethodsThe aim of present study was, therefore, to review
   scientific evidence systematically and conduct a meta-analysis into the
   contribution of exposure to pesticides to hypothyroidism. PubMed,
   Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched. The findings
   are presented as OR, HR, PR, IRR, and 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI).
   A fixed-effect model using the inverse-variance method and
   random-effects inverse-variance model with DerSimonian-Laird method were
   used for estimating the pooled estimates. Cochran Q and I2 tests were
   used to confirm the heterogeneity of selected studies.ResultsTwelve
   studies were included in the systematic review, and 9 studies in the
   meta-analysis. Epidemiological evidence suggested that exposure to
   insecticides including organochlorines, organophosphates, and
   pyrethroids increased risk of hypothyroidism (adjusted odds ratio (aOR)
   = 1.23, 95\%CI = 1.14, 1.33 for organochlorines, aOR = 1.12, 95\%CI =
   1.07, 1.17 for organophosphates, aOR = 1.15, 95\%CI = 1.03, 1.28 for
   pyrethroids). Exposure to herbicides also increased risk of
   hypothyroidism (aOR = 1.06, 95\%CI = 1.02, 1.10). However, exposure to
   fungicides and fumigants was not found to be associated with
   hypothyroidism.ConclusionTo increase current knowledge and confirm
   evidence to date future research needs to center on large-scale
   longitudinal epidemiological and biological studies, examination of
   dose-response relationships, the controlling of relevant confounding
   variables, using standardized and high sensitivity tools, and
   investigating the effects of environmental exposure.},

Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {905},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been linked to
   adverse birth outcomes; however, to date, the available studies on such
   relations, with the exception of birth weight, has not been
   systematically synthesized. We conducted a systematic review and
   meta-analysis of the available observational studies on the association
   of maternal exposure to PAHs and their metabolites during pregnancy with
   indicators of fetal growth and gestational age at delivery. We searched
   Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus systematically for all relevant
   published papers in English until 13 January 2023. Random effects
   meta-analysis was applied to synthesize the association estimates.
   Publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression. A total of 31
   articles were included in our review (n = 703,080 participants). Our
   quality assessment of reviewed papers showed that 19 research had
   excellent, nine had good, and three had fair quality. Most of the
   reviewed studies on exposure to PAHs and their metabolites with
   gestational age and preterm birth (seven studies) reported no
   statistically significant as-sociation. Eight studies were eligible for
   our meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that higher
   levels of maternal urinary 1-OHP was associated with lower birth weight,
   birth length and head circumference and a higher risk of low birth
   weight (LBW). However, these associations were not statistically
   significant. Similarly, the combined association between maternal
   urinary 1-OHP and newborn's Ponderal index (PI) and Cephalization index
   were not statistically significant. Overall, our systematic review and
   meta-analysis suggested a potential adverse impact of exposure to PAHs
   on LBW, HC, and CC; however, further studies are required to be able to
   draw concrete conclusions on such associations.},

Title = {Maternal pesticide exposure and risk of preterm birth: A systematic
   review and meta-analysis},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {178},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Background: Maternal pesticide exposure might be associated with adverse
   pregnancy outcomes through triggering inflammation and oxidative stress
   and disrupting endocrine functions. Yet the association between prenatal
   pesticide exposure and risk of preterm birth remains inconclusive.
   Objectives: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of human
   observational studies using the Office of Health Assessment and
   Translation (OHAT) framework to explore the association of per ten-fold
   increase of pesticide concentrations in maternal biological samples
   during pregnancy with risk of preterm birth and length of gestational
   age at birth.
   Data source: Five English (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of
   Science and Scopus) and 3 Chinese databases (China national knowledge
   infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and Chinese Biomedical Literature
   Database (CBM)) were searched till Jan 18th, 2023. Study eligibility
   criteria, participants, and interventions: To be included, pesticide
   exposure should be measured in maternal biological samples during
   pregnancy and in log-transformed forms. The primary outcome was preterm
   birth and the secondary outcome was gestational age at birth. Study
   appraisal, synthesis methods and confidence assessment: Quality of
   studies was evaluated using OHAT Risk of Bias Tool. Evidence was
   quantitatively synthesized with Correlated and Hierarchical Effects
   (CHE) model. The confidence rating in the body of evidence was done
   using OHAT.
   Results: A total of 21 studies reported by 18 papers were included, with
   7 studies for preterm birth and 19 for gestational age at birth. The
   meta-analysis found a ten-fold increase of pesticide concentrations was
   potentially associated with risk of preterm birth (pooled OR = 1.28;
   95\%CI: 0.93, 1.78) and shortened gestational age at birth (beta =
   -0.10; 95\%CI: -0.21, 0.01). Sampling biospecimens in different
   trimesters was identified as a potential modifier in the association
   between pesticide exposure and length of gestational age (F = 2.77, P <
   0.05). For studies that collected samples at any time during pregnancy,
   pesticide exposure was found to be associated with shortened length of
   gestational age (beta = -0.43; 95\%CI: -0.81, -0.06). The confidence
   rating in the body of evidence was ``moderate{''} and ``very low{''} for
   preterm birth and gestational age at birth, respectively.
   Conclusion: Our result suggested moderate evidence of an association
   between pesticide exposure and higher risk of preterm birth. Yet more
   studies are still needed with larger sample size and careful
   considerations of confounders and accuracy of outcome measurements.
   Attention is also required on other pesticide compounds in addition to
   organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides, and on windows of
   susceptibility.},

   Focusing on transcriptional activity and gene expression disruption},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {494},
Month = {AUG 1},
Abstract = {Environmental and human monitoring studies have witnessed increasing
   occurrence of emerging per-/poly-fluoroalkyl substances (ePFASs)
   worldwide. Three classes of ePFASs, namely chlorinated
   polyfluoroalkylether sulfonic acids, hexafluoropropylene oxide
   homologues and short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids attracted the most
   attention. It is, therefore, the goal of this review to systematically
   and critically analyse the toxicity and toxicological mechanisms of
   these ePFASs based on the papers published between 2017 and 2022. The
   review summarized the main findings from both in vivo and in vitro
   studies, covering the hepatotoxicity of ePFASs and their interference
   with the endocrine system, including reproductive, developmental and
   thyroid toxicity. It also summarized the changes in gene expression in
   the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad
   axis of the model organisms after ePFASs exposure. The changes in gene
   expression in vitro and in vivo provide a clearer understanding of the
   toxicological mechanisms of ePFASs interference on hormonal levels
   (i.e., estradiol, testosterone, and thyroid hormones), developmental
   disturbance (e.g., swim bladder dysfunction) and lipid metabolism
   disruption (e.g., lipid droplet accumulation and hepatomegaly). In the
   end, future research directions on the toxicological mechanisms of
   ePFASs are suggested.},

   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and they have shown a trend for
   association with ischemic stroke. The study also revealed that living
   near a source of POPs contamination constitutes a risk of exposure and
   an increased risk of ischemic stroke. Although our study provides a
   strong positive association of POPs with ischemic stroke, more extensive

Title = {Early-life exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and autistic
   traits in childhood and adolescence: a systematic review of
   epidemiological studies},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENDOCRINOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {14},
Month = {JUN 9},
Abstract = {Aims: Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during critical
   neurodevelopmental windows has been associated with the risk of autistic
   traits. This systematic review of epidemiological studies examined the
   association between maternal exposure to EDCs during pregnancy and the
   risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the offspring.Methods: We
   searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from
   inception to November 17, 2022, for studies investigating the
   association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and outcomes related to
   ASD. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility,
   extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The review was registered
   in PROSPERO (CRD42023389386).Results: We included 27 observational
   studies assessing prenatal exposure to phthalates (8 studies),
   polychlorinated biphenyls (8 studies), organophosphate pesticides (8
   studies), phenols (7 studies), perfluoroalkyl substances (6 studies),
   organochlorine pesticides (5 studies), brominated flame retardants (3
   studies), dioxins (1 study), and parabens (1 study). The number of
   examined children ranged from 77 to 1,556, the age at the assessment of
   autistic traits ranged from 3 to 14 years, and most studies assessed
   autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale. All but one study
   was considered to have a low risk of bias. Overall, there was no
   association between maternal exposure to specific ECDs during pregnancy
   and the occurrence of autistic traits in offspring.Conclusions: Findings
   from the epidemiological studies evaluated here do not support an
   association between prenatal exposure to ECDs and the likelihood of
   autistic traits in later in life. These findings should not be
   interpreted as definitive evidence of the absence of neurodevelopment
   effects of EDCs affecting ASD risk, given the limitations of current
   studies such as representative exposure assessment, small sample sizes,
   inadequacy to assess sexually dimorphic effects, or the effects of EDC
   mixtures. Future studies should carefully address these limitations.},

   review of the literatures},
Journal = {THYROID RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {16},
Number = {1},
Month = {MAY 15},
Abstract = {Thyroid cancer is considered as one of the most prevalent cancers in the
   world. Some pesticides can play a role as a potentially important risk
   factor in thyroid cancer by affecting thyroid morphology and thyroid
   hormone homeostasis. The aim of present study was to systematically
   review the available epidemiological evidence for human exposure to
   pesticides and thyroid cancer. Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus
   and Web of Science by suitable keywords from January 2000 to May 2021.
   Standard techniques for systematic reviews were followed in the current
   study and results reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for
   Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Based on the
   inclusion and exclusion criteria, finally seven studies including four
   cohort studies and three case-control studies were reviewed.
   Organochlorines (OCPs) in more cases, Organophosphates (OPs) and
   Carbamates insecticides, herbicides and fungicides were the studied
   pesticides. Inconsistent results were reported in the surveyed articles
   on the OCPs. Two articles on the Carbamates (Carbaryl and Mancozeb)
   showed consistently an inverse association between exposure and thyroid
   cancer. Increased risk of thyroid cancer due to the exposure to the
   Malathion was reported in one article on the OPs. Due to the limited
   current knowledge about the effect of pesticides on thyroid cancer in
   humans, human health policies must be implemented to control
   individual's exposure to chemicals through using of botanical pesticides
   in agricultural. Also, more studies must be done to fill this gap of
   knowledge.},

Journal = {OPHTHALMIC RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {66},
Number = {1},
Pages = {892-902},
Abstract = {Background: Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) repair by pars plana
   vitrectomy (PPV) combined air tamponade has many advantages compared
   with PPV combined gas tamponade. However, there are controversial
   outcomes in RRD cases involving the lower quadrants. Objective: This
   study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PPV combined air
   tamponade in patients with RRD compared with PPV combined gas tamponade
   and whether it could be a safe alternative to PPV combined gas
   tamponade. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases
   published until September 2022 were comprehensively searched for studies
   that compared PPV combined with air tamponade and gas tamponade in
   patients with RRD. The rate of primary treatment success, best-corrected
   visual acuity (BCVA), and postoperative complications were extracted
   from the final eligible studies. The mean difference (MD) and risk ratio
   (RR) were calculated for continuous and dichotomous variables,
   respectively, with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of
   8 studies with 668 eyes in the air tamponade group and 944 in the gas
   tamponade group were included. There was no significant difference in
   the rate of primary treatment success between the air tamponade group
   and the gas tamponade group (RR = 1.00, P = 0.79). In addition, the
   subgroup analysis suggested that whether retinal breaks were located
   above or below, there was no significant difference in either rate of
   primary treatment success (RR = 0.99, P = 0.89; RR = 1.02, P = 0.45).
   There was no significant difference in mean BCVA 3 months after surgery
   (MD = -0.02, P = 0.50). For postoperative complications, mean
   postoperative IOP was lower in the air tamponade at one day (MD = -4.24,
   P < 0.001), and there was no significant difference between the two
   groups at 7 days (MD = -0.45, P = 0.71), one month (MD = -0.69, P =
   0.33), and 3 months (MD = 0.69, P = 0.35) after surgery. The rate of
   epiretinal membrane (ERM) development was lower in the air tamponade
   group (RR = 0.48, P = 0.04). Conclusions: For patients with
   uncomplicated RRD, PPV combined air tamponade is a feasible and safe
   alternative to PPV combined gas tamponade, regardless of the position of
   retinal breaks, with a similar primary treatment success rate,
   postoperative BCVA, and fewer postoperative complications.},

Abstract = {Background: Air tamponade's effectiveness in treatment of rhegmatogenous
   retinal detachment (RRD) remains unclear.Objective: We aimed to review
   the surgical outcomes between air and gas tamponade after vitrectomy for
   RRD.Method: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were
   reviewed. The study protocol was registered in the International
   Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42022342284).
   The primary outcome was the primary anatomical success after vitrectomy.
   The secondary outcome was the prevalence of postoperative ocular
   hypertension. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of
   Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system.Results:
   Ten studies involving 2677 eyes were included. One study was randomized,
   and the others were non-randomized. The primary anatomical success after
   vitrectomy was not significantly different between the air and gas
   groups (odds ratio {[}OR], 1.00; 95\% confidence interval {[}CI],
   0.68-1.48). The risk of ocular hypertension was significantly lower in
   the air group (OR, 0.14; 95\% CI, 0.09-0.24). The certainty of evidence
   regarding air tamponade having an comparable anatomical outcome and
   lower frequency of postoperative ocular hypertension in treatment of RRD
   were low.Discussion: The current evidence base for tamponade selection
   in treatment of RRD has several major limitations. Further appropriately
   designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection.},

Title = {Global ambient air quality monitoring: <i>Can mosses help?</i> A
   systematic meta-analysis of literature about passive moss biomonitoring},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {26},
Number = {3},
Pages = {5735-5773},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Surging incidents of air quality-related public health hazards, and
   environmental degradation, have prompted the global authorities to seek
   newer avenues of air quality monitoring, especially in developing
   economies, where the situation appears most alarming besides
   difficulties around `adequate' deployment of air quality sensors. In the
   present narrative, we adopt a systematic review methodology (PRISMA,
   Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses)
   around recent global literature (2002-2022), around moss-based passive
   biomonitoring approaches which might offer the regulatory authorities a
   complementary means to fill `gaps' in existing air quality records.
   Following the 4-phased search procedure under PRISMA, total of 123
   documents were selected for review. A wealth of research demonstrates
   how passive biomonitoring, with strategic use of mosses, could become an
   invaluable regulatory (and research) tool to monitor atmospheric
   deposition patterns and help identifying the main drivers of air quality
   changes (e.g., anthropogenic and/or natural). Besides individual
   studies, we briefly reflect on the European Moss Survey, underway since
   1990, which aptly showcases mosses as `naturally occurring' sensors of
   ambient air quality for a slew of metals (heavy and trace) and
   persistent organic pollutants, and help assessing spatio-temporal
   changes therein. To that end, we urge the global research community to
   conduct targeted research around various pollutant uptake mechanisms by
   mosses (e.g., species-specific interactions, environmental conditions,
   land management practices). Of late, mosses have found various
   environmental applications as well, such as in epidemiological
   investigations, identification of pollutant sources and transport
   mechanisms, assessment of air quality in diverse and complex urban
   ecosystems, and even detecting short-term changes in ambient air quality
   (e.g., COVID-19 Lockdown), each being critical for the authorities to
   develop informed and strategic regulatory measures. To that end, we
   review current literature and highlight to the regulatory authorities
   how to extend moss-based observations, by integrating them with a wide
   range of ecological indicators to assess regional environmental
   vulnerability/risk due to degrading air quality. Overall, an underlying
   motive behind this narrative was to broaden the current regulatory
   outlook and purview, to bolster and diversify existing air quality
   monitoring initiatives, by coupling the moss-based outputs with the
   traditional, sensor-based datasets, and attain improved spatial
   representation. However, we also make a strong case of conducting more
   targeted research to fill in the `gaps' in our current understanding of
   moss-based passive biomonitoring details, with increased case studies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {448},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {As alternatives of long-chain PFASs (Poly- and perfluoroalkyl
   substances), perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (PFPiAs) are increasingly
   observed in the environment, but their environmental behaviors have not
   been well understood. Here, the microbial biotransformation of C6/C6 and
   C8/C8 PFPiA in two soils (Soil N and Y) was investigated. After 252 d
   and 330 d of incubation with PFPiAs in Soil N and Y respectively, the
   levels of PFPiAs decreased distinctly, accompanied by the increasing
   perfluorohexaphosphonic acid (PFHxPA) or perfluorooctanophosphonic acid
   (PFOPA) formation, magnifying PFPiAs were susceptible to C-P cleavage,
   which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations.
   The half-lives of the PFPiAs were longer than one year, while generally
   shorter in Soil N than in Soil Y and that of C6/C6 was shorter than
   C8/C8 PFPiA (392 d and 746 d in Soil N, and 603 and 1155 d in Soil Y,
   respectively). Metagenomic sequencing analysis revealed that
   Proteobacteria as the primary host of the potential functional genes
   related to C-P bond cleavage might be the crucial phyla contributing to
   the biotransformation of PFPiAs. Meanwhile, the more intensive
   interactions between the microbes in Soil N consistently contribute to
   its greater capacity for transforming PFPiAs.},

Abstract = {Importance Tractional retinal detachment (TRD) occurs in approximately
   5\% of people with proliferative diabetic retinopathy and poses a threat
   to vision. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) is the treatment of choice for
   TRD.Objective To determine anatomic and functional outcomes of PPV for
   the treatment of TRD in people with diabetes (dTRD).Data SourcesMEDLINE
   and Embase were searched systematically from January 1, 2000, to
   February 20, 2022. In addition, a reference list of eligible studies
   were screened.Study Selection Eligible studies were those published in
   English, those reporting outcomes of PPV for dTRD, and those that
   included more than 25 eyes and with a minimum follow-up of 3 months.Data
   Extraction and Synthesis Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic
   Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines for data
   extraction/synthesis were followed, and the National Institute for
   Health quality assessment tool was used to assess risk of bias. Study
   eligibility was determined independently by 2 reviewers; data extraction
   was conducted by 1 reviewer and entries checked for accuracy by another.
   Data were pooled using a random-effects model.Main Outcomes and
   MeasuresMain outcomes included rate of failure of retinal reattachment
   following 1 surgery and final visual acuity (VA). The association of
   baseline patient characteristics and surgical maneuvers with
   postoperative surgical outcomes was investigated.Results Of the 406
   studies identified, 38 (3839 eyes) were eligible and included for
   analysis. Patients had a median (IQR) age of 52.2 (49.6-55.7) years. In
   the studies reporting patient sex (31 of 38 studies), 1441 were female
   individuals (50.1\%). The overall failure rate of retinal reattachment
   after 1 surgery was 5.9\% (95\% CI, 1.4\%-8.3\%), and the mean final VA
   was 0.94 (95\% CI, 0.82-1.05) logMAR (approximate Snellen equivalent,
   6/53; 95\% CI, 6/39-6/71). People with higher preoperative VA achieved
   higher postoperative vision (0.66 logMAR worse final vision; 95\% CI,
   0.39-0.84 per 1.0 logMAR worse at baseline; P <.001). On multivariable
   analysis, no other patient characteristics or surgical variables had a
   statistically significant association with outcomes.Conclusions and
   Relevance Results of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest
   that PPV was an effective strategy to achieve retinal reattachment in
   people with dTRD. Given that higher preoperative VA was the only factor
   associated with higher postoperative vision, early intervention should
   be considered and discussed in detail with patients. Overall, final
   postoperative VA remains low, and patients should be counseled on the
   guarded prognosis of dTRD.},

Abstract = {Purpose: To conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis investigating the
   association between polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) exposure and serum
   thyroid hormone levels among adults. Methods: Eleven studies met
   inclusion criteria for analysis following systematic search of PubMed,
   Embase, and Scopus databases. Of these, 7 studies measured exposure by
   the total sum of PCB congeners ( n-ary sumation PCB), 1 study measured
   individual PCB congener levels, and 3 studies measured both n-ary
   sumation PCB levels and PCB congener levels. Correlation coefficients
   (r) were extracted from each study. Summary estimates were calculated
   for n-ary sumation PCB levels and PCB congeners reported by 2 or more
   studies: PCB 28, 52, 101, 105, 118, 138, 153, and 180, using random

   between n-ary sumation PCBs and T3 (r: -0.09; 95\% CI: -0.17, -0.02) and
   FT3 (r: -0.24; 95\% CI: -0.36, -0.12). Congener-specific analysis found
   T3 to be negatively correlated with PCB-153 (r: -0.19; 95\% CI: -0.34,
   -0.03) and PCB-180 (r: -0.14; 95\% CI: -0.26, -0.01), whereas TSH was
   positively correlated with PCB-105 (r: 0.15; 95\% CI: 0.02, 0.28).
   Conclusions: The present study is the first meta-analysis to investigate
   the association between PCB exposure and thyroid hormone dysfunction

Abstract = {Prostate Cancer (PCa) is the second most common hormone-sensitive
   neoplasm among men and the fifth cause of death due to malignancy in
   developed countries. Moreover, studies have shown the links between
   polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and hormone-related cancers such as
   prostate cancer. Hence, we conducted a systematic review and
   meta-analysis to evaluate the potential relationship between the PCBs
   and developing PCa. In this meta-analysis study, the relevant databases
   such as Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus were studied for English
   research. The Newcastle-Ottawa Scale was applied to evaluate the quality
   of the selected publications. The GRADE method was used to assess the
   risk of bias studies. After reviewing the relevant studies, a cohort and
   seven case-control studies entered the meta-analysis. These articles
   were published during 2003-2021 with 2989 participants and 1212 PCa
   cases. The heterogeneity among the studies was significant (p = 0.001,
   I-2 = 70.61). Using a random-effects model, the association between the
   serum and plasma levels of PCBs and the risk of PCa was not shown to be
   significant (OR = 1.12; 95\% CI: 0.90-1.39). The results of Egger's test
   showed no trace of publication bias in the studies (P of bias = 0.573).
   This systematic review and meta-analysis was presented based on
   relatively strong evidence and has confirmed negatively significant
   associations between PCa risk and some PCBs congeners (PCB 44, 52, and

Title = {Metabolomics for exposure assessment and toxicity effects of
   occupational pollutants: current status and future perspectives},
Journal = {METABOLOMICS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {18},
Number = {9},
Month = {SEP 9},
Abstract = {Introduction Work-related exposures to harmful agents or factors are
   associated with an increase in incidence of occupational diseases. These
   exposures often represent a complex mixture of different stressors,
   challenging the ability to delineate the mechanisms and risk factors
   underlying exposure-disease relationships. The use of omics measurement
   approaches that enable characterization of biological marker patterns
   provide internal indicators of molecular alterations, which could be
   used to identify bioeffects following exposure to a toxicant.
   Metabolomics is the comprehensive analysis of small molecule present in
   biological samples, and allows identification of potential modes of
   action and altered pathways by systematic measurement of metabolites.
   Objectives The aim of this study is to review the application of
   metabolomics studies for use in occupational health, with a focus on
   applying metabolomics for exposure monitoring and its relationship to
   occupational diseases. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus
   electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant studies
   published up to 2021. Results Most of reviewed studies included worker
   populations exposed to heavy metals such as As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn and
   organic compounds such as tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin,
   trichloroethylene, polyfluoroalkyl, acrylamide, polyvinyl chloride.
   Occupational exposures were associated with changes in metabolites and
   pathways, and provided novel insight into the relationship between
   exposure and disease outcomes. The reviewed studies demonstrate that
   metabolomics provides a powerful ability to identify metabolic
   phenotypes and bioeffect of occupational exposures. Conclusion Continued
   application to worker populations has the potential to enable
   characterization of thousands of chemical signals in biological samples,
   which could lead to discovery of new biomarkers of exposure for
   chemicals, identify possible toxicological mechanisms, and improved
   understanding of biological effects increasing disease risk associated
   with occupational exposure.},

Title = {Environmental health influences in pregnancy and risk of gestational
   diabetes mellitus: a systematic review},
Journal = {BMC PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {22},
Number = {1},
Month = {AUG 18},
Abstract = {Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common
   pregnancy complications globally. Environmental risk factors may lead to
   increased glucose levels and GDM, which in turn may affect not only the
   health of the mother but assuming hypotheses of ``fetal programming{''},
   also the health of the offspring. In addition to traditional GDM risk
   factors, the evidence is growing that environmental influences might
   affect the development of GDM. We conducted a systematic review
   analyzing the association between several environmental health risk
   factors in pregnancy, including climate factors, chemicals and metals,
   and GDM. Methods We performed a systematic literature search in Medline
   (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science Core
   Collection databases for research articles published until March 2021.
   Epidemiological human and animal model studies that examined GDM as an
   outcome and / or glycemic outcomes and at least one environmental risk
   factor for GDM were included. Results Of n = 91 studies, we classified n
   = 28 air pollution, n = 18 persistent organic pollutants (POP), n = 11
   arsenic, n = 9 phthalate n = 8 bisphenol A (BPA), n = 8 seasonality, n =
   6 cadmium and n = 5 ambient temperature studies. In total, we identified
   two animal model studies. Whilst we found clear evidence for an
   association between GDM and air pollution, ambient temperature, season,
   cadmium, arsenic, POPs and phthalates, the findings regarding phenols
   were rather inconsistent. There were clear associations between adverse
   glycemic outcomes and air pollution, ambient temperature, season, POPs,
   phenols, and phthalates. Findings regarding cadmium and arsenic were
   heterogeneous (n = 2 publications in each case). Conclusions
   Environmental risk factors are important to consider in the management
   and prevention of GDM. In view of mechanisms of fetal programming, the
   environmental risk factors investigated may impair the health of mother
   and offspring in the short and long term. Further research is needed.},

   toxicity},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {918},
Month = {MAR 25},
Abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a class of endocrine -disrupting
   chemicals (EDCs) widely present in the environment. PCBs have been of
   concern due to their anti/estrogen-like effects, which make them more
   toxic to the female reproductive system. However, there is still a lack
   of systematic reviews on the reproductive toxicity of PCBs in females,
   so the adverse effects and mechanisms of PCBs on the female reproductive
   system were summarized in this paper. Our findings showed that PCBs are
   positively associated with lower pregnancy rate, hormone disruption,
   miscarriage and various reproductive diseases in women. In animal
   experiments, PCBs can damage the structure and function of the ovaries,
   uterus and oviducts. Also, PCBs could produce epigenetic effects and be
   transferred to the offspring through the maternal placenta, causing
   development retardation, malformation and death of embryos, and damage
   to organs of multiple generations. Furthermore, the mechanisms of PCBs
   -induced female reproductive toxicity mainly include receptor -mediated
   hormone disorders, oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and
   epigenetic modifications. Finally, we also present some directions for
   future research on the reproductive toxicity of PCBs. This detailed
   information provided a valuable reference for fully understanding the
   reproductive toxicity of PCBs.},

   microplastics and organic contaminants in biosolids: A review},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {466},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {This review provides a comprehensive overview of the occurrence, fate,
   treatment and multi-criteria analysis of microplastics (MPs) and organic
   contaminants (OCs) in biosolids. A meta-analysis was complementarily
   analysed through the literature to map out the occurrence and fate of
   MPs and 10 different groups of OCs. The data demonstrate that MPs
   (54.7\% occurrence rate) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants
   (44.2\% occurrence rate) account for the highest prevalence of
   contaminants in biosolids. In turn, dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCBs) and phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs) have the lowest rates
   (<0.01\%). The occurrence of several OCs (e.g., dioxin, perand
   polyfluoroalkyl substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   pharmaceutical and personal care products, ultraviolet filters,
   phosphate flame retardants) in Europe appear at higher rates than in
   Asia and the Americas. However, MP concentrations in biosolids from
   Australia are reported to be 10 times higher than in America and Europe,
   which required more measurement data for in-depth analysis. Amongst the
   OC groups, brominated flame retardants exhibited exceptional sorption to
   biosolids with partitioning coefficients (log Kd) higher than 4. To
   remove these contaminants from biosolids, a wide range of technologies
   have been developed. Our multicriteria analysis shows that anaerobic
   digestion is the most mature and practical. Thermal treatment is a
   viable option; however, it still requires additional improvements in
   infrastructure, legislation, and public acceptance.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {58},

Pages = {1842-1853},
Month = {JAN 16},
Abstract = {Following its introduction as an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid,
   hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) has been extensively
   detected in various environmental matrices. Despite this prevalence,
   limited information is available regarding its hepatotoxicity
   biomarkers. In this study, toxicokinetic simulations indicated that
   under repeated treatment, HFPO-DA in mice serum reached a steady state
   by the 4th day. To assess its subacute hepatic effects and identify
   potential biomarkers, mice were administered HFPO-DA orally at doses of
   0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 12.5, or 62.5 mg/kg/d for 7 d. Results revealed that
   the lowest observed adverse effect levels were 0.5 mg/kg/d for
   hepatomegaly and 2.5 mg/kg/d for hepatic injury. Serum metabolomics
   analysis identified 34, 58, and 118 differential metabolites in the 0.1,
   0.5, and 2.5 mg/kg/d groups, respectively, compared to the control
   group. Based on weighted gene coexpression network analysis, eight
   potential hepatotoxicity-related metabolites were identified; among
   them, kynurenic acid (KA) in mouse serum exhibited the highest
   correlation with liver injury. Furthermore, liver-targeted metabolomics
   analysis demonstrated that HFPO-DA exposure induced metabolic migration
   of the kynurenine pathway from KA to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide,
   resulting in the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the
   nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway. Notably, pretreatment with KA
   significantly attenuated liver injury induced by HFPO-DA exposure in
   mice, highlighting the pivotal roles of KA in the hepatotoxicity of
   HFPO-DA.},

Title = {Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes towards carbon neutral
   wastewater treatment: A review},
Journal = {CHEMICAL ENGINEERING JOURNAL},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {480},
Month = {JAN 15},
Abstract = {Electrochemical advanced oxidation processes (EAOPs) have been widely
   studied in efficient wastewater treatment for achieving high degradation
   efficiency of pollutants even at the expense of high electric energy
   consumption and carbon emissions. This development is inconsistent with
   the initiative of carbon neutrality. Despite the growing numbers of
   published papers on EAOPs, there is still a lack of guidelines regarding
   carbon neutral wastewater treatment, thus hampering efforts to achieve
   sustainable development of EAOPs and attain carbon neutrality. This
   review systematically summarized recent advances of EAOPs and the
   potential strategies for developing carbon neutral wastewater treatment.
   The mechanisms, performance, and defects of recent developed EAOPs via
   improving electrodes, catalysts and processes were discussed
   systematically. The effective strategies including energy conservation,
   material savings, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and
   mineralization mitigation were presented in detail. To conserve energy,
   the review also investigated the power supply capacity, degradation
   efficiency and costs in transforming renewable energy into electric
   energy for EAOPs operation. The wind turbines and photovoltaic cells
   (PVCs) could performe better than fuel cells and triboelectricity
   nanogenerators (TENGs). Furthermore, the review explored the carbon
   offset potential of EAOPs by combining with CO2RR. The carbon offset
   factor ranged from <1\% to similar to 88\%. In addition, specific
   strategies and challenges in developing carbon neutral EAOPs were
   summarized and discussed. This review was expected to constitute a
   baseline for the development of EAOPs towards carbon neutral wastewater
   treatment.},

Title = {Air quality impacts of a large waste fire in Stockholm, Sweden},
Journal = {ATMOSPHERIC ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {315},
Month = {DEC 15},
Abstract = {Fires in waste facilities are a common occurrence. Since many waste
   facilities are located adjacent to densely populated areas, these fires
   could potentially expose large populations to the emitted pollutants.
   However, at the moment there are only few field studies investigating
   the impact of waste fire emissions on air quality since the
   unpredictable nature of these events makes them challenging to capture.
   This study investigated the impact of a large and persistent
   un-prescribed fire in a waste storage facility in Stockholm county,
   Sweden, on the local air quality of two residential areas in close
   proximity to the fire. In-situ measurements of particulate matter, black
   carbon and nitrogen oxide concentrations were conducted both during open
   burning and after the fire was fully covered. In addition, filter
   samples were collected for offline analysis of organic composition,
   metal content and toxicity. Strongly increased concentrations of PM10,
   PM2.5 and black carbon were found during the open burning period,
   especially when the wind was coming from the direction of the fire. In
   addition, elevated concentrations of particulate heavy metals and
   polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were observed in the air during the
   open burning period. These results show that waste fires can have a
   strong impact on the air quality of nearby residential areas.},

Title = {A meta-analysis of randomized controlled studies on the hepatoxicity
   induced by polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in rats and mice},
Journal = {CURRENT RESEARCH IN TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {5},
Abstract = {Several toxicological studies were conducted to evaluate the
   hepatoxicity of PBDEs using different animal models, congeners, duration
   of exposure, and other parameters. These variations in different animal
   models and conditions might have an impact on extrapolating experimental
   results to humans. Hence, by the meta-analysis, we aimed to clarify and
   elucidate the species differences in hepatoxicity induced by PBDE
   exposure in rats and mice across different conditions and moderators.
   Fourteen in vivo studies that utilized rats and mice models were
   identified, and data such as author names, year of publication, type of
   PBDE congeners, rodent species, life stage of exposure, dosage,
   duration, and hepatoxicity indicators were extracted. The pooled
   standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI)
   was used to evaluate the association between hepatoxicity and PBDE
   exposure across multiple approaches of measurement. Subgroup analysis,
   meta-regression, and interaction analysis were utilized to elucidate the
   species-related differences among the results of the involved studies.
   The pooled SMD of hepatoxicity of PBDE exposure in the involved in vivo
   studies was 1.82 (p = 0.016), indicating exposure to PBDE congeners and
   mixtures is associated with a significant increase in liver toxicity in
   rodents. Moreover, findings showed that rats were more sensitive to
   PBDEs than mice with the BDE-209 had the highest SMD value. Among the
   life stages of exposure, embryonic stage was found to be the most
   sensitive to hepatoxicity induced by PBDE congeners. Positive
   relationships were found between the incidence of hepatoxicity with
   dosage and duration of exposure to PBDE. Interaction analyses showed
   significant interactions between rodent species (rats or mice), dosage,
   length of exposure, and hepatotoxicity endpoints. Rats demonstrated an
   increased susceptibility to variations in organ weight,
   histopathological changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative
   stress markers. Conversely, mice showed pronounced lipid accumulation
   and modifications in liver enzyme expression levels. However,
   significant differences were not found in terms of endoplasmic reticular
   stress as a mechanistic endpoint for hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, this
   meta-analysis showed that there might be some species-related
   differences in hepatoxicity induced by PBDE exposure in rats and mice
   depending on the parameters used. This study highlights the importance
   of cross-species extrapolation of results from animal models to
   accurately assess the potential risks to human health from exposure to
   PBDEs.},

Year = {2023},
Volume = {459},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {Marine mammals, due to their long life span, key position in the food
   web, and large lipid deposits, often face significant health risks from
   accumulating contaminants. This systematic review examines published
   literature on pollutant-induced adverse health effects in the
   International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red listed marine
   mammal species. Thereby, identifying gaps in literature across different
   extinction risk categories, spatial distribution and climatic zones of
   studied habitats, commonly used methodologies, researched pollutants,
   and mechanisms from cellular to population levels. Our findings reveal a
   lower availability of exposure-effect data for higher extinction risk
   species (critically endangered 16\%, endangered 15\%, vulnerable 66\%),
   highlighting the need for more research. For many threatened species in
   the Southern Hemisphere pollutant-effect relationships are not
   established. Non-destructively sampled tissues, like blood or skin, are
   commonly measured for exposure assessment. The most studied pollutants
   are POPs (31\%), metals (30\%), and pesticides (17\%). Research on
   mixture toxicity is scarce while pollution-effect studies primarily
   focus on molecular and cellular levels. Bridging the gap between
   molecular data and higher-level effects is crucial, with computational
   approaches offering a high potential through in vitro to in vivo
   extrapolation using (toxico-)kinetic modelling. This could aid in
   population-level risk assessment for threatened marine mammals.},

Abstract = {Background: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the status of Human
   Biomonitoring (HBM) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region and
   provide recommendations for future research, considering the increased
   environmental contaminants that pose a threat to human health in this
   rapidly industrializing area.Methods: A thorough search was performed in
   PubMed and Web of Science databases up to February 2023 to identify
   biomonitoring studies on human exposure and levels in the GCC region.
   Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility, conducted data
   extraction and risk of bias assessment. The NIH Quality Assessment Tools
   and PRISMA guidelines were utilized for quality evaluation and reporting
   of results.Results: A total of 38 eligible articles were included in
   this systematic review out of 662 articles screened. The majority of the
   publications were from Saudi Arabia (n = 24) and Kuwait (n = 10), while
   limited representation was found from Qatar (n = 3) and the UAE (n = 1).
   No articles were identified from Oman and Bahrain. The studies focused
   on metals, organohalogen compounds, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic
   hydrocarbons, and phthalates. The findings revealed elevated levels of
   metals and established correlations between metal exposure and adverse
   health effects, including infant neurodevelopmental issues, vitamin D
   deficiency, and oxidative stress. The presence of organohalogen
   compounds and pesticides was prevalent in the GCC region, with
   sig-nificant associations between exposure to these compounds and
   negative health outcomes. Notably, high levels of perchlorate were
   observed in the Kuwaiti population, and a study from Saudi Arabia found
   an association between per-and polyfluorinated substances and increased
   odds of osteoporosis.Conclusions: This review emphasizes the need to
   address environmental health challenges in the GCC region through
   improved HBM research methods and strategies. Implementing biomonitoring
   programs, conducting cohort studies, investing in tools and expertise,
   promoting collaboration, and engaging the community are crucial for
   reliable HBM data in the GCC.},

   has been countless evidences on the toxic effects of pesticides on the
   living systems. The link of exposure to pesticides with different human
   chronic diseases in the context of carcinogenicity, neurotoxicity,
   developmental toxicity, etc., have been evaluated in various types of
   studies. There are also some evidences on the link of exposure to
   pesticides with higher incidence of metabolic diseases associated with
   insulin resistance like diabetes, obesity, metabolic syndrome,
   hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome and chronic kidney diseases.
   Physiologically, weakening intracellular insulin signaling is considered
   as a compensatory mechanism for cells to cope with cellular stresses
   like xenobiotic effects, oxidative stress and inflammatory responses,
   but it can pathologically lead to a defective cycle with lowered
   sensitivity of the cells to insulin which happens in metabolic
   disorders. In this work, the data related to metabolic toxicity of
   pesticides categorized in the mentioned metabolic diseases with a focus
   on the effects of pesticides on insulin signaling pathway and the
   mechanisms of development of insulin resistance will be systematically
   reviewed and presented.},

Abstract = {As it is well known, the gut is one of the primary sites in any host for
   xenobiotics, and the many microbial metabolites responsible for the
   interactions between the gut microbiome and the host. However, there is
   a growing concern about the negative impacts on human health induced by
   toxic xenobiotics. Metab-olomics, broadly including lipidomics, is an
   emerging approach to studying thousands of metabolites in parallel. In
   this review, we summarized recent advancements in mass spectrometry (MS)
   technologies in metabolomics. In addition, we reviewed recent
   applications of MS-based metabolomics for the inves-tigation of toxic
   effects of xenobiotics on microbial and host metabolism. It was
   demonstrated that metabolomics, gut microbiome profiling, and their
   combination have a high potential to identify metabolic and microbial
   markers of xenobiotic exposure and determine its mechanism. Further,
   there is increasing evidence supporting that reprogramming the gut
   microbiome could be a promising approach to the intervention of
   xenobiotic toxicity.\& COPY; 2023 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

Title = {Marine Pollution and Advances in Biomonitoring in Cartagena Bay in the
   Colombian Caribbean},
Journal = {TOXICS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Coastal zones sustain extensive biodiversity, support key processes for
   ocean dynamics, and influence the balance of the global environment.
   They also provide resources and services to communities, determine their
   culture, and are the basis for their economic growth. Cartagena Bay in
   the Colombian Caribbean is the place of the establishment of one of the
   country's main cities, which has a great historical and tourist
   attraction, and it is also the location of the main commercial port and
   a great variety of industries. Historically, it has been affected by
   several environmental impacts and intense pollution. This situation has
   gained the attention of different researchers, so herein is presented a
   literature review with a systematic approach using RStudio's
   bibliometrix on the presence of pollutants and the impact on
   biodiversity in recent decades, providing a critical analysis of the
   state of Cartagena Bay and its future needs to ensure its recovery and
   conservation. In addition, the socioeconomic dynamics related to the
   environmental state of Cartagena Bay are presented from the framework
   drivers, pressures, status, impacts, and responses (DPSIR). The update
   and critical understanding of the sources, fate, and effects of
   pollution are important not only for the knowledge of the status of this
   singular ecosystem but also to encourage future research and entrench
   evidence to support decision makers' actions. This review highlights
   that several pollutants that have been detected exceeding sediment
   quality guidelines, like As, Cd, Hg, and PAH, are also reported to
   bioaccumulate and cause damage throughout the trophic levels of the
   coastal environment. In addition, the potential use of sentinel species
   and biomarkers for their monitoring is discussed. Finally, the factors
   that cause pollution and threaten the state of the bay continue to exert
   pressure and impact; thus, there is a call for the further monitoring of
   this ecosystem and the strengthening of policies and regulations.},

Title = {Chemical pollution, exposome and health in the population of the Canary
   Islands: a systematic review of the studies carried out and analysis of
   the situation},
Journal = {REVISTA ESPANOLA DE SALUD PUBLICA},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {97},
Month = {APR 25},
Abstract = {BACKGROUND //The set of exposures to chemical substances and their role
   as a cause of disease gives rise to the concept of the exposome,
   partially made up of chemical pollutants to which an individual is
   exposed, which is why, unlike the genome, it is an a priori modifiable
   factor, its study being crucial in terms of Public Health. The
   population of the Canary Islands has been studied in terms of its levels
   of chemical contamination, with numerous biomonitoring studies, which
   makes it necessary to characterise its exposome and its consequences in
   terms of disease, in order to implement specific corrective measures to
   minimize the impact on its health. METHODS // A review of scientific
   literature (MEDLINE and Scopus) was made, according to PRISMA criteria
   and PICO methodology, to include studies on biomonitoring of pollutants,
   or evaluating the effect of pollutants on diseases prevalent in the
   archipelago. RESULTS //Twenty-five studies, both population-based and
   hospital-based, were selected. The results show that the exposome is
   made up of at least 110 compounds or elements, 99 of which appear to be
   present from the intrauterine stage. The presence of chlorinated
   pollutants and metals stands out, which seems to be related to the high
   incidence of metabolic diseases (diabetes), cardiovascular diseases
   (hypertension) and certain types of neoplasms (breast cancer). In short,
   the consequences are conditioned by the genome of the exposed
   population, reinforcing the enormous importance of genome-exposome
   interactions in the development of pathologies. CONCLUSIONS // Our
   results indicate that it is necessary to establish corrective measures
   on the sources of pollution that modify the exposome of this population.},

Title = {Integrating -omics approaches into population-based studies of endocrine
   disrupting chemicals: A scoping review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {228},
Month = {JUL 1},
Abstract = {Health effects of endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are challenging
   to detect in the general population. Omics technologies become
   increasingly common to identify early biological changes before the
   apparition of clinical symptoms, to explore toxic mechanisms and to
   increase biological plausibility of epidemiological associations. This
   scoping review systematically summarises the application of omics in
   epidemiological studies assessing EDCs-associated biological effects to
   identify potential gaps and priorities for future research. Ninety-eight
   human studies (2004-2021) were identified through database searches
   (PubMed, Scopus) and citation chaining and focused on phthalates (34
   studies), phenols (19) and PFASs (17), while PAHs (12) and recently-used
   pesticides (3) were less studied. The sample sizes ranged from 10 to
   12,476 (median = 159), involving non-pregnant adults (38), pregnant
   women (11), children/adolescents (15) or both latter populations studied
   together (23). Several studies included occupational workers (10) and/or
   highly exposed groups (11) focusing on PAHs, PFASs and pesticides, while
   studies on phenols and phthalates were performed in the general
   population only. Analysed omics layers included metabolic profiles (30,
   including 14 targeted analyses), miRNA (13), gene expression (11), DNA
   methylation (8), microbiome (5) and proteins (3). Twenty-one studies
   implemented targeted multi-assays focusing on clinical routine blood
   lipid traits, oxidative stress or hormones. Overall, DNA methylation and
   gene expression associations with EDCs did not overlap across studies,
   while some EDCassociated metabolite groups, such as carnitines,
   nucleotides and amino acids in untargeted metabolomic studies, and
   oxidative stress markers in targeted studies, were consistent across
   studies. Studies had common limitations such as small sample sizes,
   cross-sectional designs and single sampling for exposure biomonitoring.
   In conclusion, there is a growing body of evidence evaluating the early
   biological responses to exposure to EDCs. This review points to a need
   for larger longitudinal studies, wider coverage of exposures and
   biomarkers, replication studies and standardisation of research methods
   and reporting.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {MAR 30},
Abstract = {Background and chronic pollution by organic pollutants (OPs) is a
   widespread threat in the oceans with still uncharacterized effects on
   marine ecosystems and the modulation of major biogeochemical cycles. The
   ecological impact and toxicity of this anthropogenic dissolved organic
   carbon (ADOC) is not related to the presence of a single compound but to
   the co-occurrence of a myriad of synthetic chemicals with largely
   unknown effects on heterotrophic microbial communities. We have analyzed
   the metabolic capacity of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of natural
   oceanic communities from the north Pacific (Costa Rica dome) and
   Atlantic oceans challenged with environmentally relevant levels of ADOC.
   In the Atlantic, ADOC-exposed MAGs responded transcriptionally more
   strongly compared to controls than in the Pacific, possibly mirroring
   the higher relevance of ADOC compounds as carbon source in oligotrophic
   environments. The largest proportions of transcripts originated from
   MAGs belonging in the families Rhodobacteraceae and Flavobacteriaceae,
   known to play a role on consumption of several OPs. In the Atlantic,
   archaeal Poseidoniales showed the highest transcription levels after 2 h
   of ADOC exposure, although no increase of relative abundances in the DNA
   pool was recorded after 24 h, whereas Methylophaga showed the opposite
   pattern. Both taxa are suggested to be actively involved in the
   consumption of biogenic alkanes produced by cyanobacteria. We observed
   similar gene expression profiles of alkane degradation and methylotrophy
   signature genes. These findings, plus the chemical degradation of
   alkanes measured in the experiments, provides experimental evidence of
   the consumption of anthropogenic hydrocarbons and synthetic chemicals at
   the low concentrations found in the ocean, and modulation of microbiomes
   by ADOC.},

Title = {Role of Microbes in the degradation of organic semivolatile compounds in
   polar ecosystems: A review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {879},
Month = {JUN 25},
Abstract = {The Arctic and the Antarctic Continent correspond to two eco-regions
   with extreme climatic conditions. These regions are exposed to the
   presence of contaminants resulting from human activity (local and
   global), which, in turn, represent a challenge for life forms in these
   environments. Anthropogenic pollution by semi-volatile organic compounds
   (SVOCs) in polar ecosystems has been documented since the 1960s.
   Currently, various studies have shown the presence of SVOCs and their
   bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the polar regions with negative
   effects on biodiversity and the ecosystem. Although the production and
   use of these compounds has been regulated, their persistence continues
   to threaten biodiversity and the ecosystem. Here, we summarize the
   current literature regarding microbes and SVOCs in polar regions and
   pose that bioremediation by native microorganisms is a feasible strategy
   to mitigate the presence of SVOCs. Our systematic review revealed that
   microbial communities in polar environments represent a wide reservoir
   of biodiversity adapted to extreme conditions, found both in terrestrial
   and aquatic environments, freely or in association with vegetation.
   Microorganisms adapted to these environments have the potential for
   biodegradation of SVOCs through a variety of genes encoding enzymes with
   the capacity to metabolize SVOCs. We suggest that a comprehensive
   approach at the molecular and ecological level is required to mitigate
   SVOCs presence in these regions. This is especially patent when
   considering that SVOCs degrade at slow rates and possess the ability to
   accumulate in polar ecosystems. The implications of SVOC degradation are
   relevant for the preservation of polar ecosystems with consequences at a
   global level.},

Volume = {53},

Month = {NOV 17},
Abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been widely used around the world
   due to their high-efficiency and broad-spectrum insecticidal effects.
   However, they pose a severe threat to ecosystems and human health due to
   their easy bioaccumulation and high toxicity. Periphyton is ubiquitous
   in the submerged substrates surface. It plays a crucial role in carbon,
   nutrients elements cycling and contaminants transformation in
   environment. Periphyton can remove OCPs through bioadsorption,
   bioaccumulation and biodegradation, which alters the fate of OCPs in
   environment. This review presents a comprehensive summary of OCPs
   occurrence, global cycle, potential harm in environment, and their
   removal by periphyton. The OCPs residual have been detected frequently
   in different environmental medias such as water, soil, atmosphere,
   sediment, and organisms. Their harm is depending on their
   physicochemical properties and the exposure route. The main compositions
   and functions of periphyton have been summarized. Moreover, the
   artificial cultivation methods of periphyton in laboratory and in-situ
   field are compared. In addition, the mechanisms of periphyton-mediated
   OCPs removal and the main factors impacting OCPs removal are also
   discussed. Periphyton could self-regulate its biological communities to
   adapt to the OCPs and environment, and then regenerate new species to
   degrade OCPs. Finally, the prospect of OCPs removal by periphyton and
   future studies are also proposed. This review provides a systematic
   introduction on current knowledge of OCPs occurrence, cycle, potential
   harm in environment, and their removal by periphyton.},

Journal = {POULTRY SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {102},
Number = {4},
Month = {APR},
Abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is one of the essential environmental stressors
   for the poultry industry in the world. Given its large specific surface
   area, PM can adsorb and carry a variety of pollutants, including heavy
   metal ions, ammonia, and persistent organic pollutants such as
   pathogenic microorganisms. High concentrations of PM induce poultry
   respiratory inflammation and trig-ger various diseases. However, the
   pathogenic mechanism of PM in poultry houses on respiratory diseases has
   not been clarified due to its complexity and lack of accurate assays. In
   terms of pathogenesis, there are 3 ways to explain this phenomenon:
   Inhaled PM irritates the respiratory tract, decreases immune resistance,
   and causes a respiratory disease; respiratory tract irritation by
   com-pounds presents in PM; infections with pathogenic and non-pathogenic
   microorganisms attached to PM. The lat-ter 2 modes of influence are more
   harmful. Specifically, PM can induce the respiratory disease through
   several toxic mechanisms, including ammonia ingestion and
   bio-accumulation, lung flora dysbiosis, oxidative stress, and metabolic
   disorders. Therefore, this review summarizes the characteristics of PM
   in the poultry house and the impact of poultry PM on respiratory disease
   and proposes potential pathogenic mechanisms.},

   Biochemical outcomes during the embryonic development of Pseudobatos
   horkelii},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {323},
Month = {APR 15},
Abstract = {Coastal elasmobranchs are vulnerable to chemicals mostly due to their
   k-strategic life history characteristics and high trophic positions.
   Embryos might be particularly exposed through the maternal offloading of
   contaminants, possibly leading to disruptions during critical
   developmental phases. Yet, knowledge on biochemical outcomes of prenatal
   exposure in elasmobranchs is notably limited. Therefore, we aimed to
   investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to contaminants in embryos
   of the critically endangered Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii.
   Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons
   (PAHs), pharmaceuticals and per-sonal care products, and metals were
   determined in embryos. Additionally, glutathione S-transferase activity
   (GST), glutathione (GSH), and metallothionein levels (MT) were analyzed.
   Finally, lipid peroxidation levels (LPO) and protein carbonyl groups
   (PCO) were assessed. Embryonic exposure depended on yolk consumption,
   which was conspicuous in earlier development. We observed a dilution
   effect of contaminants levels, potentially related to biotransformation
   of these compounds throughout the embryonic development. Nevertheless,
   GST was not correlated to contaminant concentrations. The multivariate
   relationship between antioxidant components (GSH and GST) and LPO and
   PCO was negative, suggesting the lack of efficient defense of these
   biomarkers in early development, leading to oxidative damage. In this
   context, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to contaminants
   might impact the redox status in embryos of P. horkelii, leading to
   oxidative damage. Furthermore, metal concentrations influenced MT
   levels, suggesting this as a potential detoxification pathway in this
   species.},

   The optimized chip can be coupled with microarrays to realize fast,

Title = {Partitioning of Persistent Organic Pollutants between Adipose Tissue and
   Serum in Human Studies},

Abstract = {Blood is the most widely used matrix for biomonitoring of persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs). It is assumed that POPs are homogenously
   distributed within body lipids at steady state; however, the variability
   underlying the partitioning of POPs between fat compartments is poorly
   understood. Hence, the objective of this study was to review the state
   of the science about the relationships of POPs between adipose tissue
   and serum in humans. We conducted a narrative literature review of human
   observational studies reporting concentrations of POPs in paired samples
   of adipose tissue with other lipid-based compartments (e.g., serum
   lipids). The searches were conducted in SCOPUS and PUBMED. A
   meta-regression was performed to identify factors responsible for
   variability. All included studies reported high variability in the
   partition coefficients of POPs, mainly between adipose tissue and serum.
   The number of halogen atoms was the physicochemical variable most
   strongly and positively associated with the partition ratios, whereas
   body mass index was the main biological factor positively and
   significantly associated. To conclude, although this study provides a
   better understanding of partitioning of POPs to refine physiologically
   based pharmacokinetic and epidemiological models, further research is
   still needed to determine other key factors involved in the partitioning
   of POPs.},

Abstract = {Purpose Environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a
   mixture of chemical compounds capable to interfere with endocrine axis
   at different levels and to which population is daily exposed. This paper
   aims to review the relationship between EDCs and breast, prostate,
   testicle, ovary, and thyroid cancer, discussing carcinogenic activity of
   known EDCs, while evaluating the impact on public health.Methods A
   literature review regarding EDCs and cancer was carried out with
   particular interest on meta-analysis and human studies.Results The
   definition of EDCs has been changed through years, and currently there
   are no common criteria to test new chemicals to clarify their possible
   carcinogenic activity. Moreover, it is difficult to assess the full
   impact of human exposure to EDCs because adverse effects develop
   latently and manifest at different ages, even if preclinical and
   clinical evidence suggest that developing fetus and neonates are most
   vulnerable to endocrine disruption.Conclusion EDCs represent a major
   environmental and health issue that has a role in cancer development.
   There are currently some EDCs that can be considered as carcinogenic,
   like dioxin and cadmium for breast and thyroid cancer; arsenic,
   asbestos, and dioxin for prostate cancer; and
   organochlorines/organohalogens for testicular cancer. New evidence
   supports the role of other EDCs as possible carcinogenic and pregnant
   women should avoid risk area and exposure. The relationship between EDCs
   and cancer supports the need for effective prevention policies
   increasing public awareness.},

Title = {Maternal exposure to pesticides and autism or
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders in offspring: A meta-analysis},
Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {313},
Month = {FEB},
Abstract = {Objective: To analyze the association between maternal pesticide
   exposure and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and
   attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) in offspring.
   Method: Five databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science,
   Medline, as well as PsycINFO were systematically retrieved for the
   records related to pesticide exposure during pregnancy and ASD and ADHD
   in offspring before August 30, 2022. The pesticide category, maternal
   age and window of exposure as the main subgroups were presented.
   Results: 949 studies were initially identified, and 19 studies were
   eventually included. Eleven were on ASD, seven were on ADHD, and one was
   on both disorders. Maternal pesticide exposure was positively related to
   ASD (pooled OR = 1.19 (95\%CI: 1.04 to 1.36)) and ADHD (pooled OR = 1.20
   (95\%CI: 1.04 to 1.38)) in offspring. In the subgroup analysis,
   organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) (pooled OR = 1.14 (95\%CI: 1.04 to
   1.24)), pyrethroid (pooled OR = 1.40 (95\%CI: 1.09 to 1.80)), and
   maternal age >= 30 years old (pooled OR = 1.24 (95\%CI: 1.10 to 1.40))
   increased the risk of ASD in offspring. Maternal organochlorine
   pesticides (OCPs) exposure was a risk factor for ADHD in offspring
   (pooled OR = 1.22 (95\%CI: 1.03 to 1.45)).
   Conclusion: Maternal pesticide exposure increased the risk of ASD and
   ADHD in offspring. Moreover, OPs, py-rethroid, and maternal age >= 30
   years old were found to be risk factors affecting children's ASD.
   Maternal exposure to OCPs increased the risk of ADHD in offspring. Our
   findings contribute to our understanding of health risks related to
   maternal pesticide exposure and indicate that the in utero developmental
   period is a vulnerable window-of-susceptibility for ASD and ADHD risk in
   offspring. These findings should guide policies that limit maternal
   exposure to pesticides, especially for pregnant women living in
   agricultural areas.},

Title = {Endocrine-disrupting chemicals and endocrine neoplasia: A forty-year
   systematic review},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {218},
Month = {FEB 1},
Abstract = {Introduction: Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are exogenous
   substances recognised as relevant tumouri-genic chemicals. Studies show
   that even EDCs which were long abolished are still contributing to the
   increasing incidence of neoplasia.Aim: To investigate the association
   between human exposure to EDCs and the risk of endocrine-related
   tumours: breast, prostate, thyroid, uterus, testis, and ovary.Methods: A
   systematic review using PubMed, Scopus, and Embase was conducted,
   searching for original obser-vational studies published between 1980 and
   2020, approaching EDCs exposure and endocrine tumourigenic risk in
   humans. We comprised neoplasia of six endocrine organs. We included all
   the studies on EDCs reporting tumour odds ratio, risk ratio, or hazard
   ratio. Study levels of confidence and risk of bias were accessed
   applying accredited guidelines. Human-made accidents and natural EDCs
   were not considered in the present study.Results: Our search returned
   3271 papers. After duplicate removal and screening, only 237 papers were
   included (corresponding to 268 records). EDCs were grouped from the most
   frequently (pesticides) to the least frequently studied (salts). The
   most tumourigenic EDC groups were phthalates (63\%), heavy metals
   (54\%), particulate matter (47\%), and pesticides (46\%). Pesticides
   group comprised the highest number of retrieved studies (n = 133).
   Increased neoplasia risk was found in 43-67\% of the studies, with a
   lower value for ovary (43\%) and a higher value for thyroid
   (67\%).Conclusions: The innovative nature of our review comes from
   including human studies of six endocrine-related neoplasia aiming to
   understand the contribution of specific EDCs groups to each organ's
   tumourigenesis. Thy-roid was the organ presenting the highest cancer
   risk after EDC exposure which may explain the increasing thyroid cancer
   incidence. However, detailed and controlled works reporting the effects
   of EDCs are scarce, probably justifying conflicting results.
   Multinational and multicentric human studies with biochemical analysis
   are needed to achieve stronger and concordant evidence.},

Title = {A Systematic Review of the Scientific Literature on Pollutant Removal
   from Stormwater Runoff from Vacant Urban Lands},
Journal = {SUSTAINABILITY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {14},
Number = {19},
Month = {OCT},
Abstract = {Even though the common acknowledgment that vacant urban lands (VUL) can
   play a positive role in improving stormwater management, little
   synthesized literature is focused on understanding how VUL can take
   advantage of different stormwater control measures (SCMs) to advance
   urban water quality. The project aims to provide urban planners with
   information on the remediation of vacant lands using urban runoff
   pollutant removal techniques. To find the most effective removal method,
   relevant scholarly papers and case studies are reviewed to see what
   types of vacant land have many urban runoff pollutants and how to
   effectively remove contaminants from stormwater runoff in the city by
   SCMs. The results show that previously developed/used land (but now
   vacant) has been identified as contaminated sites, including prior
   residential, commercial, industrial, and parking lot land use from urban
   areas. SCMs are effective management approaches to reduce nonpoint
   source pollution problems runoff. It is an umbrella concept that can be
   used to capture nature-based, cost-effective, and eco-friendly treatment
   technologies and redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive,
   economically viable, and with good public acceptance. Among these
   removal techniques, a bioretention system tends to be effective for
   removing dissolved and particulate components of heavy metals and
   phosphorus. Using different plant species and increasing filter media
   depth has identified the effectiveness of eliminating nitrate nitrogen
   (NO3-N). A medium with a high hydraulic conductivity covers an existing
   medium with low hydraulic conductivity, and the result will be a higher
   and more effective decrease for phosphorus (P) pollutants. In addition,
   wet ponds were found to be highly effective at removing polycyclic
   aromatic hydrocarbons, with removal rates as high as 99\%. For the
   removal of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) pollutants, despite the
   implementation of SCMs in urban areas to remove PFAAs and
   particulate-related contaminants in stormwater runoff, the current
   literature has little information on SCMs' removal of PFAAs. Studies
   have also found that VUL's size, shape, and connectivity are
   significantly inversely correlated with the reduction in stormwater
   runoff. This paper will help planners and landscape designers make
   efficient decisions around removing pollutants from VUL stormwater
   runoff, leading to better use of these spaces.},

Journal = {CHEMOSPHERE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {307},

Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic environmental
   toxins, and the level of chemicals accumulated in the body through the
   food chain has been linked to the incidence of diseases such as type 2
   diabetes, car-diovascular disease, and cancer. We analyzed the
   concentration of POPs and circulating metabolites and investigated the
   associations between the concentration of plasma metabolites and the
   levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides
   (OCPs) to determine the effect of the accumulation of POPs in human
   samples. Metabolic profiling of plasma from 276 Korean participants was
   performed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and statistical
   analyses. The concentrations of PCBs and OCPs in each sample were
   measured. Correlation analysis and a covariate-adjusted general linear
   model (GLM) were used to investigate the association of the
   concentration of POPs with circulating metabolites in human blood
   samples. We found that four categories of E6PCBs and E5OCPs based on
   rank were significantly correlated with 4 and 5 metabolites,
   respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors, including age,
   sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol intake, physical
   activity, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. According to the GLM
   analyses, 3 metab-olites, namely, creatinine, acetate, and formate,
   among the 4 correlated metabolites were associated with four categories
   of rank-based E6PCBs. On the other hand, the quartiles of the rank-based
   E5OCPs were not associated with any circulating metabolites among the 5
   correlated metabolites. Our findings indicate that the metabolites
   related to short-chain fatty acids and creatine can be useful risk
   indicators for estimating the effect of PCB exposure.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF GLOBAL HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {12},
Abstract = {Background Exposure to the toxic metal cadmium is widespread globally
   and es-pecially prevalent in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs).
   Early life (from pregnancy through childhood) is a vulnerable window for
   exposure. Therefore, interventions in low-and middle-income countries to
   prevent or reduce early life exposure to cadmium may be relevant for
   improving public health.Methods We systematically reviewed five
   databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Global Health Medicus, Greenfile, and
   PubMed). Synthesis without meta -analy-sis (narrative synthesis) was
   used for data analysis due to the wide heterogeneity of included
   studies. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using modified
   GRADE criteria. Results 4098 articles were returned by the search and a
   total of 26 studies from 21 LMICs were included in this review, ranging
   from policies to clinical treat-ment, rehabilitation and clean-up
   methods for agricultural soil, interventions for nutrition and cooking,
   and anti-pollution strategies at the household level. The interventions
   targeted children, pregnant and postpartum women, and/or women of
   childbearing age. While several studies provided some evidence of
   ef-fectiveness, none appeared to offer a realistic solution for cadmium
   pollution at scale. Agricultural and food preparation studies were
   relatively frequent, partic-ularly related to rice. Studies on air
   filtration during pregnancy indicated some effectiveness in reducing
   indoor cadmium exposures.Conclusions Cadmium pollution is a persistent

Title = {Computational toxicology studies on the interactions between
   environmental contaminants and biomacromolecules},
Journal = {CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {67},
Number = {35},
Pages = {4180-4191},
Abstract = {Through manufacturing operations, product consumption, and drug
   administration, humans and wildlife are continuously exposed to
   environmental contaminants (ECs) throughout their lives. Faced with the
   potentially harmful effects of ECs on humans, regulatory agencies around
   the world require the integration of epidemiological, in vivo
   toxicological, and in vitro mechanistic data to provide the necessary
   information for hazard classification, labeling, and risk management of
   chemicals. However, animal studies have time-consuming and high-cost
   defects and ethical problems. High-throughput in vitro assays are also
   unable to provide systematic toxicological information for chemical
   hazard classification for over 100000 chemicals in commerce.
   Recently, computing resources and artificial intelligence have
   innovatively improved the accuracy and speed of machine learning (ML)
   algorithms, and the structural biology and deep learning (DL) algorithms
   (e.g., AlphaFold2 and AF2Complex) have incrementally resolved a large
   number of biomolecular crystal structures. Thus, the use of
   computational toxicology techniques in environmental toxicology has
   increased significantly. It is estimated that computational toxicology
   techniques can perform virtual screening of millions of compounds in a
   limited amount of time for the contaminant-biomolecule interaction
   process. Thus, computational toxicology techniques can reduce the
   initial experimental cost of identifying environmental emerging
   contaminants, increase information on the toxicity mechanisms of ECs,
   and improve the efficiency of hazard identification of ECs by regulatory
   authorities.
   This study systematically reviews computational toxicology techniques
   commonly used to analyze ECs-biomolecule interactions, including
   molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and machine
   learning-based modelling. Molecular docking is a well-established
   molecular simulation method that explores the interactions between
   biomolecules and small molecules to predict their binding modes and
   binding affinities. MD can simulate the flexible binding process of
   contaminant-biomolecule and the dynamic conformational shift process of
   contaminant-biomolecule complexes, providing more comprehensive
   information on the interaction mechanism. Machine learning-based
   modelling is a novel computational toxicology technique that is
   completely different from molecular simulation. It mainly uses publicly
   available structural information and in chemico, in vitro, and in vivo
   bioactivity data to construct (quantitative) structure-activity
   relationships (Q)SARs based on ML algorithms, and uses (Q)SAR models to
   rapidly improve the efficiency of virtual screening of ECs targeted at
   biomolecules, and further deepen the analysis of contaminant-biomolecule
   interaction mechanisms in complex biological contexts. In this paper,
   the main applications of these techniques in the field of environmental
   toxicology in recent years are systematically reviewed, including the
   mechanistic studies of contaminant-biomolecule interactions and
   high-throughput virtual screening. The advantages and limitations of
   these techniques in terms of ligand-receptor interaction,
   explainability, training efficiency, computational depth, and biological
   processes are discussed. Results showed that MD simulations, which can
   deeply explore contaminant-biomolecule interactions, are unable to
   achieve the high-throughput virtual screening of ECs. Machine
   learning-based modelling, which can reflect the complex biological
   processes and achieve high accuracy prediction, unable to effectively
   interpret the prediction results due to the `black box' defects.
   Molecular docking, which has the potential to be a high throughput
   virtual screening method, is limited by local sampling and approximate
   scoring function deficiencies. These problems limit the ability of
   molecular docking to analyze more comprehensive mechanisms of
   ECs-biomolecule interactions. Therefore, only the combination of
   multiple computational toxicology techniques to develop an integrated
   workflow for mechanistic analysis and virtual screening can compensate
   for their respective shortcomings and obtain optimal results. However,
   how to increase the computational throughput screening while maintaining
   the mechanism analysis remains a key issue to be addressed in the
   future.},

Title = {Avian colouration in a polluted world: a meta-analysis},
Journal = {BIOLOGICAL REVIEWS},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 MAR 17},
Abstract = {Brilliant, diverse colour ornaments of birds were one of the crucial
   cues that led Darwin to the idea of sexual selection. Although avian
   colouration plays many functions, including concealment,
   thermoregulation, or advertisement as a distasteful prey, a
   quality-signalling role in sexual selection has attracted most research
   attention. Sexually selected ornaments are thought to be more
   susceptible to external stressors than naturally selected traits, and as
   such, they might be used as a test for environmental quality. For this
   reason, the last two decades have seen numerous studies on the impact of
   anthropogenic pollution on the expression of various avian colour
   traits. Herein, we provide the first meta-analytical summary of these
   results and examine whether there is an interaction between the
   mechanism of colour production (carotenoid-based, melanin-based and
   structural) and the type of anthropogenic factor (categorised as heavy
   metals, persistent organic pollutants, urbanisation, or other).
   Following the assumption of heightened condition dependence of ornaments
   under sexual selection, we also expected the magnitude of effect sizes
   to be higher in males. The overall effect size was close to significance
   and negative, supporting a general detrimental impact of anthropogenic
   pollutants on avian colouration. In contrast to expectations, there was
   no interaction between pollution types and colour-producing mechanisms.
   Yet there were significant differences in sensitivity between
   colour-producing mechanisms, with carotenoid-based colouration being the
   most affected by anthropogenic environmental disturbances. Moreover, we
   observed no significant tendency towards heightened sensitivity in
   males. We identified a publication gap on structural colouration, which,
   compared to pigment-based colouration, remains markedly understudied and
   should thus be prioritised in future research. Finally, we call for the

Title = {A Systematic Review on Microplastic Contamination in Fishes of Asia:
   Polymeric Risk Assessment and Future Prospectives},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICOLOGY AND CHEMISTRY},
Year = {2024},
Month = {2024 FEB 14},
Abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) have attracted global concern because of their
   harmful effects on marine biota; their toxic properties can negatively
   impact aquatic ecosystems. Fish is an essential source of protein for
   humans, playing a crucial role in daily food intake. Until recently, MPs
   were addressed primarily as environmental pollutants, but they are now
   increasingly recognized as contaminants in the food supply. The present
   review has comprehended the current knowledge of MP contamination in
   freshwater and marine fishes of Asia, including 112 peer-reviewed
   sources from 2016 to 2023. The review recorded 422 Asian fishes (345
   marine and 77 freshwater) to be contaminated with MPs. Clarias
   gariepinus and Selaroides leptolepi have shown maximum MP contamination
   in the freshwater and marine environments of Asia, respectively.
   Omnivorous and carnivorous fishes exhibited higher susceptibility to
   ingesting MPs. Benthopelagic, demersal, and reef-associated habitats
   were identified as more prone to MP accumulation. In both freshwater and
   marine environments, China has the highest number of contaminated
   species among all the countries. Pollution indices indicated high MP
   contamination in both freshwater and marine environments. A prevalence
   of fibers was recorded in all fishes. Black- and blue-colored MPs of
   <500 mu m-1 mm size were found dominantly. Polyethylene terephthalate
   and polyethylene were recorded as the prevalent plastic polymers in
   freshwater and marine fish, respectively. Overall, the review served as
   a comprehensive understanding of MP concentrations and variations
   between species, between feeding habits, and between geographic
   locations, which can be pivotal for addressing pressing environmental
   challenges, protecting human health, and fostering global sustainability
   efforts in the face of escalating plastic pollution. Environ Toxicol

Abstract = {Heavy metal pollution has become a grave environmental problem drawing
   worldwide attention. Reclamation of polluted land using innovative and
   ecofriendly way is crucial to restore soil fertility. During the past
   two decades, various approaches of bio-/phytoremediation are gaining
   their acceptance to remediate contaminated soil. Recently, the use of
   reactive nanomaterials for phytoremediation or `nano-phytoremediation'
   is becoming popular, claiming to improve the phyto-availability of heavy
   metals and reduce their toxicity through transformation or
   detoxification. Nanomaterials exhibit distinct properties concerning
   size, shape, reactivity, and ratio of surface area to volume rendering
   their potential for a range of applications including remediation of
   polluted soil environments with heavy metals, chlorinated organic
   solvents, organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   and polychlorinated biphenyls. Further, the combination of plants and
   associated microbes such as rhizospheric bacteria or arbuscular
   mycorrhizal fungi has the potential to significantly improve the
   nano-phytoremediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. This review
   focuses on recent developments on nano-phytoremediation, plant root
   associated microbes, and their interaction for developing an integrated
   and efficient nano-phytoremediation strategy for improved soil
   remediation in general and for soil contaminated with heavy metal. The
   application of nanomaterials combined with phytoremediation was

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE \& TECHNOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {58},

Abstract = {Catalyzed reduction processes have been recognized as important and
   supplementary technologies for water treatment, with the specific aims
   of resource recovery, enhancement of bio/chemical-treatability of
   persistent organic pollutants, and safe handling of oxygenate ions.
   Palladium (Pd) has been widely used as a catalyst/electrocatalyst in
   these reduction processes. However, due to the limited reserves and high
   cost of Pd, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the
   Pd-catalyzed decontamination process to design affordable and
   sustainable Pd catalysts. This review provides a systematic summary of
   recent advances in understanding Pd-catalyzed reductive decontamination
   processes and designing Pd-based nanocatalysts for the reductive
   treatment of water-borne pollutants, with special focus on the
   interactions and transformation mechanisms of pollutant molecules on Pd
   catalysts at the atomic scale. The discussion begins by examining the
   adsorption of pollutants onto Pd sites from a thermodynamic viewpoint.
   This is followed by an explanation of the molecular-level reaction
   mechanism, demonstrating how electron-donors participate in the
   reductive transformation of pollutants. Next, the influence of the Pd
   reactive site structure on catalytic performance is explored.
   Additionally, the process of Pd-catalyzed reduction in facilitating the
   oxidation of pollutants is briefly discussed. The longevity of Pd
   catalysts, a crucial factor in determining their practicality, is also
   examined. Finally, we argue for increased attention to mechanism study,
   as well as precise construction of Pd sites under batch synthesis
   conditions, and the use of Pd-based catalysts/electrocatalysts in the
   treatment of concentrated pollutants to facilitate resource recovery.},

Abstract = {Chlorophenols are persistent environmental pollutants used in
   synthesizing dyes, drugs, pesticides, and other industrial products. The
   chlorophenols released from these processes seriously threaten the
   environment and human health. The present study describes 4-chlorophenol
   (4-CP) degradation activity and metagenome structure of a bacterial
   consortium enriched in a 4-CP-containing medium. The consortium utilized
   4-CP as a single carbon source at a wide pH range, temperature, and in
   the presence of heavy metals. The immobilized consortium retained its
   degradation capacity for an extended period. The 4-aminoantipyrine
   colorimetric analysis revealed complete mineralization of 4-CP up to 200
   mg/L concentration and followed the zero-order kinetics. The addition of
   glycerol and yeast extract enhanced the degradation efficiency. The
   consortium showed both ortho- and meta-cleavage activity of catechol
   dioxygenase. Whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis revealed the microbial
   compositions and functional genes related to xenobiotic degradation
   pathways. The identified genes were mapped on the KEGG database to
   construct the 4-CP degradation pathway. The results exhibited the high
   potential of the consortium for bioremediation of 4-CP contaminated

Year = {2024},
Volume = {272},
Month = {MAR 1},
Abstract = {Polystyrene microplastics (MPs) are persistent environmental pollutants
   commonly encountered in daily human life. Numerous studies have
   demonstrated their ability to induce liver damage, including oxidative
   stress, inflammation, and lipid accumulation. However, limited
   information exists regarding preventive measures against this issue. In
   our study, we investigated the potential preventive role of selenium
   nanoparticles (YC-3SeNPs) derived from Yak -derived Bacillus cereus, a
   novel nanobiomaterial known for its antioxidant properties and lipid
   metabolism regulation. Using transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we
   identified key genes and metabolites associated with oxidative stress
   and lipid metabolism imbalance induced by MPs. Upregulated genes (Scd1,
   Fasn, Irs2, and Lpin) and elevated levels of arachidonic and palmitic
   acid accumulation were observed in MP -exposed mice, but not in those
   exposed to SeNPs. Further experiments confirmed that SeNPs significantly
   attenuated liver lipid accumulation and degeneration caused by MPs.
   Histological results and pathway screening validated our findings,
   revealing that MPs suppressed the Ppar alpha pathway and Nrf2 pathway,
   whereas SeNPs activated both pathways. These findings suggest that MPs
   may contribute to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease
   (NAFLD), while SeNPs hold promise as a future nanobio-product for its
   prevention.},

Title = {Mechanistic study of C5F10O-induced lung toxicity in rats: An
   eco-friendly insulating gas alternative to SF6},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {916},
Month = {MAR 15},
Abstract = {The global warming and other environmental problems caused by SF6
   emissions can be reduced due to the widespread use of eco-friendly
   insulating gas, perfluoropentanone (C5F10O). However, there is an
   exposure risk to populations in areas near C5F10O equipment, so it is
   important to clarify its biosafety and pathogenesis before large-scale
   application. In this paper, histopathology, transcriptomics, 4D-DIA
   proteomics, and LC -MS metabolomics of rats exposed to 2000 ppm and 6000
   ppm C5F10O are analyzed to reveal the mechanisms of toxicity and health
   risks. Histopathological shows that inflammatory cell infiltration,
   epithelial cell hyperplasia, and alveolar atrophy accompanied by
   alveolar wall thickening are present in both low -dose and high -dose
   groups. Analysis of transcriptomic and 4D-DIA proteomic show that Cell
   cycle and DNA replication can be activated by both 2000 ppm and 6000 ppm
   C5F10O to induce cell proliferation. In addition, it also leads to the
   activation of pathways such as Antigen processing and presentation, Cell
   adhesion molecules and Complement and coagulation cascades, T cell
   receptor signal path, Th1 and T cell receptor signal path, Th1 and Th2
   cell differentiation, complement and coagulation cascades. Finally, LC
   -MS metabolomics analysis confirms that the metabolic pathways
   associated with glycerophospholipids, arachidonic acid, and linoleic
   acid are disrupted and become more severe with increasing doses. The
   mechanism of lung toxicity caused by C5F10O is systematically expounded
   based on the multi-omics analysis and provided biosafety references for
   further promotion and application of C5F10O.},

Month = {JAN 24},
Abstract = {Organochalcogen compounds are prevalent in numerous natural products,
   pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymers, biological molecules and
   synthetic intermediates. Direct chalcogenation of C-H bonds has evolved
   as a step- and atom-economical method for the synthesis of
   chalcogen-bearing compounds. Nevertheless, direct C-H chalcogenation
   severely lags behind C-C, C-N and C-O bond formations. Moreover,
   compared with the C-H monochalcogenation, reports of selective
   mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive dichalcogenation of C-H bonds are
   relatively scarce. The past decade has witnessed significant
   advancements in selective mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive
   dichalcogenation of various C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(3))-H bonds via
   transition-metal-catalyzed/mediated, photocatalytic, electrochemical or
   metal-free approaches. In light of the significance of both mono- and
   dichalcogen-containing compounds in various fields of chemical science
   and the critical issue of chemoselectivity in organic synthesis, the
   present review systematically summarizes the advances in these research
   fields, with a special focus on elucidating scopes and mechanistic
   aspects. Moreover, the synthetic limitations, applications of some of
   these processes, the current challenges and our own perspectives on
   these highly active research fields are also discussed. Based on the
   substrate types and C-H bonds being chalcogenated, the present review is
   organized into four sections: (1) transition-metal-catalyzed/mediated
   chelation-assisted selective C-H mono-/dichalcogenation or exclusive
   dichalcogenation of (hetero)arenes; (2) directing group-free selective
   C-H mono-/dichalcogenation or exclusive dichalcogenation of
   electron-rich (hetero)arenes; (3) C(sp(3))-H dichalcogenation; (4)
   dichalcogenation of both C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(3))-H bonds. We believe the
   present review will serve as an invaluable resource for future
   innovations and drug discovery.},

Title = {A review of heavy metal risks around e-waste sites and comparable
   municipal dumpsites in major African cities: Recommendations and future
   perspectives},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {501},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {In Africa, the effects of informal e-waste recycling on the environment
   are escalating. It is regularly transported from developed to developing
   nations, where it is disassembled informally in search of precious
   metals, thus increasing human exposure to harmful compounds. Africa has
   a serious problem with e-waste, as there are significant facilities in
   Ghana and Nigeria where imported e-waste is unsafely dismantled.
   however, because they are in high demand and less expensive than new
   ones, old electronic and electrical items are imported in large
   quantities, just like in many developing nations. After that, these
   objects are frequently scavenged to recover important metals through
   heating, burning, incubation in acids, and other techniques. Serious
   health hazards are associated with these activities for workers and
   individuals close to recycling plants. At e-waste sites in Africa, there
   have been documented instances of elevated concentrations of hazardous
   elements, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy metals in dust,
   soils, and vegetation, including plants consumed as food. Individuals
   who handle and dispose of e-waste are exposed to highly hazardous
   chemical substances. This paper examines heavy metal risks around
   e-waste sites and comparable municipal dumpsites in major African
   cities. Elevated concentrations of these heavy metals metal in
   downstream aquatic and marine habitats have resulted in additional
   environmental impacts. These effects have been associated with
   unfavourable outcomes in marine ecosystems, such as reduced fish stocks
   characterized by smaller sizes, increased susceptibility to illness, and
   decreased population densities. The evidence from the examined studies
   shows how much e-waste affects human health and the environment in
   Africa. Sub-Saharan African nations require a regulatory framework that
   includes specialized laws, facilities, and procedures for the safe
   recycling and disposal of e-waste.},

   in Buriganga River fish},
Journal = {HELIYON},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {9},
Number = {12},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {For decades, the Buriganga River in Dhaka, Bangladesh, has suffered from
   persistent pollution, leading to heavy metal contamination in fish
   samples that poses significant risks to human health. This study
   conducted an analysis of the whole bodies of various fish species,
   including Heteropnuestes fossilis, Channa punctatus, Notopterus
   notopterus Channa striata and Colisa fasciata to examine the
   concentrations of Chromium, Manganese, Nickel, Copper, Zinc, Arsenic,
   Cadmium, Barium, and Lead. The analysis was performed using inductively
   coupled plasma mass spectrometry, revealing notable concentrations of
   Pb, Ni, Cd, and Zn, with average levels of 6.85, 156.77, 0.41, and 3.37
   mg/kg, respectively.Assessment of target hazard quotients for Pb,
   against recommended benchmark doses of observable effects, indicated
   levels 2 to 6 times higher than the recommended safety thresholds. The
   cumulative totals of target hazard quotients across multiple specimens
   exceeded 2 and, in some cases, reached up to 7, surpassing the safety
   cutoff of 1. The risk of cancer from Ni and Pb was calculated to be 1 in
   10,000 on average for each, classifying it as a moderate risk.
   Quantitative analysis revealed that heavy metal concentrations of Pb,
   Ni, Cd, and Zn in most fish samples exceeded reference safety values.
   Simultaneously, hazard analysis identified critical concerns regarding
   Pb content in one sample, and cumulative toxin loads in almost every
   sample were deemed unsafe for regular consumption. In addition to
   quantitative assessments, a qualitative survey employed observation
   techniques, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews to
   investigate consumption behaviors and viewpoints on fish contamination.
   The results revealed that consumers generally held an enthusiastic
   attitude towards consuming these fish and were largely unaware of the
   associated health hazards.},

Abstract = {Endometriosis, characterized by endometrial-like mucosal tissue outside
   the uterine cavity, is a reproductive disorder afflicting about 10\% of
   women within the reproductive age. The pathogenesis of endometriosis has
   been attributed to factors like genetics, environmental particles, and
   hormones. A comprehensive review of studies from July 2010 to July 2023
   across multiple databases was done to aid in a better understanding of
   the same. The investigation focused on studies delineating the
   correlation between endocrine disruptors, microRNAs, and endometriosis.
   To optimize the search scope, keywords and subject headings were used as
   search terms. Then, two authors rigorously assessed studies using
   criteria, selecting 27 studies from various databases. Notably, dioxins,
   organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls exhibited a
   solid connection for endometriosis, while bisphenol A and phthalates
   yielded conflicting results. The heightened presence of bisphenol A,
   polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalates was linked to altered gene
   expression, including genes like AKR1B10, AKR1C3, and FAM49B. MicroRNAs
   like miRNA-31, miRNA-144, and miRNA-145 emerged as vital factors in the
   onset of endometriosis and progression. Furthermore, elevated expression
   of miR-1304-3p, miR-544, and miR-3684 and reduced expression of miR-3935
   and miR-4427 exert substantial influence on signaling pathways like
   NF-kappa B, MAPK, and Wnt/beta-catenin. Currently, literature shows an
   independent link between endocrine disruptor exposure and endometriosis
   and between microRNA dysregulation and endometriosis. However, research
   lacks the combination of all three factors. The review delves into the
   effects of endocrine disruptors and microRNAs on the pathogenesis of
   endometriosis to improve our understanding of the disorder and in
   finding therapies.},

   in selected waste dumpsites in Lagos Metropolis, Nigeria},
Journal = {FRONTIERS IN ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {11},
Month = {NOV 30},
Abstract = {Dumpsites are reservoirs of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and
   heavy metals (HMs), constituting environmental hazards to humanity.
   Autochthonous microorganisms in dumpsites exhibit various degrees of
   responses to contaminants. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of
   information on the types and concentration of pollutants and the array
   of microorganisms in these dumpsites which may play important roles in
   the metabolism of such pollutants or other community processes.
   Therefore, determining the microbial community structure in such
   contaminated sites across a municipality is essential for profiling the
   taxa that would serve as consensus degraders of the pollutants. In this
   study, soil samples from three dumpsites (Cele, CS; Solous, SS; and
   Computer Village, CVS) were characterized for geochemical properties
   using GC-MS, MP-AES, and other analytical protocols, while the dynamics
   of bacterial communities were evaluated based on their 16S rRNA gene
   barcodes. A significant difference in the bacterial communities was
   observed among the dumpsites in relation to the extent of pollution
   caused by POPs and HMs. CVS, with the highest HM contamination, was rich
   in Actinobacteria (41.7\%) and Acidobacteria (10.2\%), in contrast to CS
   and SS. Proteobacteria (34.1\%) and Firmicutes (20\%) were the dominant
   phyla in CS (highest POP contamination), while Bacteroidetes (45.5\%)
   and Proteobacteria (39.9\%) were dominant in SS soil. Bacillus was the
   dominant genus in the most polluted dumpsite. Canonical correspondence
   analysis revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and HMs
   shaped the structure of the bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
   in the most polluted dumpsite. Out of a total of 706 OTUs, 628 OTUs
   exhibited a significant correlation (>50\%) with benzo(b)fluoranthene,
   azobenzene, dibenzofurans, pyrene, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene, Cu, and Zn. In
   particular, Proteobacteria (Achromobacter sp. and Serratia sp.),
   Bacteroidetes (Zhouia sp.), and Firmicutes (Bacillus sp.) were suggested
   to be pivotal to the ecophysiology of dumpsite soils contaminated with
   POPs and HMs. The results generally underscored the importance of
   metagenomic and physicochemical analyses of polluted systems in enabling
   correlations for useful prediction of drivers of such ecosystems. This
   will further improve our understanding of the metabolic potential and
   adaptation of organisms in such systems.},

Title = {Novel insights into aerobic 17β-estradiol degradation by enriched
   microbial communities from mangrove sediments},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2024},
Volume = {465},
Month = {MAR 5},
Abstract = {Various persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including estrogens are
   often enriched in mangrove regions. This research investigated the
   estrogens pollution levels in six mangroves located in the Southern
   China. The estrogen levels were found to be in the range of 5.3-24.9
   ng/g dry weight, suggesting that these mangroves had been seriously
   contaminated. The bacterial communities under estrogen stress were
   further enriched by supplementing 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as the sole
   carbon source. The enriched bacterial communities showed an excellent E2
   degradation capacity > 95 \%. These communities were able to transform
   E2 into estrone (E1), 4-hydroxy-estrone, and keto-estrone, etc. 16 S
   rDNA sequencing and metagenomics analysis revealed that bacterial taxa
   Oleiagrimonas, Pseudomonas, Terrimonas, and Nitratireductor etc. were
   the main contributors to estrogen degradation. Moreover, the genes
   involved in E2 degradation were enriched in the microbial communities,
   including the genes encoding 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase,
   estrone 4-hydroxylase, etc. Finally, the analyses of functional genes
   and binning genomes demonstrated that E2 was degraded by bacterial
   communities via dehydrogenation into E1 by 17 beta-hydroxysteroid
   dehydrogenase. E1 was then catabolically converted to 3a alpha-H- 4
   alpha(3'-propanoate)-7a beta-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione via
   4,5-seco pathway. Alternatively, E1 could also be hydroxylated to
   keto-estrone, followed by B-ring cleavage. This study provides novel
   insights into the biodegradation of E2 by the bacterial communities in
   estrogen-contaminated mangroves.},

Abstract = {Flame retardant (FR) exposure has been linked to several environmental
   and human health effects. Because of this, the production and use of
   several FRs are regulated globally. We reviewed the available records of
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and hexabromocyclododecanes
   (HBCDDs) in human breast milk from literature to evaluate the efficacy
   of regulation to reduce the exposure of FRs to humans. Two-hundred and
   seven studies were used for analyses to determine the spatial and
   temporal trends of FR exposure. North America consistently had the
   highest concentrations of PBDEs, while Asia and Oceania dominated HBCDD
   exposure. BDE-49 and -99 indicated decreasing temporal trends in most
   regions. BDE-153, with a longer half-life than the aforementioned
   isomers, typically exhibited a plateau in breast milk levels. No
   conclusive trend could be established for HBCDD, and insufficient
   information was available to determine a temporal trend for BDE-209.
   Breakpoint analyses indicated a significant decrease in BDE-47 and -99
   in Europe around the time that regulation has been implemented,
   suggesting a positive effect of regulation on FR exposure. However, very
   few studies have been conducted globally (specifically in North America)
   after 2013, during the time when the most recent regulations have been
   implemented. This meta-analysis provides insight into global trends in
   human exposure to PBDEs and HBCDD, but the remaining uncertainty
   highlights the need for ongoing evaluation and monitoring, even after a
   compound group is regulated.},

Title = {Adaptive evolutionary strategies of microbes to manganese in
   nitrogen-culturing sludge},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {430},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Human activities have significantly increased the accessibility of
   nitrogen and manganese, which has had an impact on the evolution of
   microorganisms. To investigate the effect of increasing manganese
   accessibility on microbial nitrogen cycle, Mn-HA (Manganese-Humus
   chelates), a naturally occurring compound in the form of organochelate,
   was introduced into the conventional nitrification-denitrification
   process. The findings revealed that the addition of Mn-HA significantly
   facilitated the removal of ammonium and nitrate potentially by Mnammox
   (anaerobic ammonium oxidation mediated by Mn (IV)-oxide reduction) and
   Mn-based autotrophic denitrification. Metagenomic analyses suggested the
   presence of manganese-redox microorganisms involved in nitrification and
   denitrification, indicating the occurrence of manganese redox-coupled
   nitrogen metabolism processes. Additionally, the production and
   consumption of bio-MnOx (bio-Manganese Oxides) were observed in
   conjunction with denitrification and nitrification. The production of
   unequal amounts of bio-MnOx suggested that bio-MnOx may have been
   deposited in the sediment. This was confirmed by the BCR sequential
   extraction experiment. Coupling Mn metabolism with N metabolism is an
   adaptive strategy for nitrogen metabolizing microorganisms. For
   Mn-sensitive populations, they gain respite from Mn-rich environments by
   adopting strategies such as manganese oxidation, regulating manganese
   transport, pumping out intracellular manganese and evolving other
   manganese resistance genes.},

Abstract = {BackgroundResearch on the effect of pesticide exposure on health has
   been largely focused on occupational settings. Few reviews have
   synthesized the associations between dietary pesticide exposure and
   health outcomes in non-occupationally exposed adults.ObjectiveWe aim to
   summarize the evidence regarding dietary pesticide exposure and
   non-communicable diseases (NCD) in adults, using a systematic review of
   prospective studies.MethodsElectronic and manual searches were performed
   until July 2023. The inclusion criteria were the following: 1) adults
   aged >= 18years, 2) (non)-randomized trials, prospective cohort studies,
   3) dietary exposure to pesticides. A bias analysis was carried out using
   the Nutrition Evidence Systematic Review guidelines based on the
   Cochrane ROBINS-I.ResultsA total of 52 studies were retrieved and 6
   studies that met the above criteria were included. Studies were
   conducted either in France or in the United States. The studies
   investigated the risk of cancer (n = 3), diabetes (n = 1),
   cardiovascular diseases (n = 1), and mortality (n = 1). The quality of
   the studies varied with overall grades derived from the bias analysis
   ranging from low to moderate bias. The level of evidence was estimated
   as low for the risk of cancer while the grading was not assignable for
   other outcomes, as only one study per outcome was
   available.ConclusionsAlthough further research is warranted to examine
   more in depth the relationships between low-dose chronic exposure to
   pesticides through diet and NCD outcomes in non-occupationally-exposed
   adults, studies suggest a possible role of exposure to dietary pesticide
   on health. Standardized methodological guidelines should also be
   proposed to allow for comparison across studies.},

Abstract = {Perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8), a physically and chemically inert synthetic
   compound, has recently emerged as a promising candidate for the
   treatment of DED due to its unique properties. A systematic review that
   only include full-length randomized controlled studies (RCTs), reporting
   the effects of F6H8 in three databases, PubMed, Scopus and Web of
   Science, was performed according to the PRISMA statement. The search
   period was per-formed between June 1, 2023, and June 21, 2023. The
   Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to analyze the quality of the
   studies selected. A total of six RCTs were included in this systematic
   review. F6H8 tear substitutes treatment achieved a higher improvement
   than control group interventions in most of the reported variables. The
   mean differences between both groups were in favor of F6H8 and were as
   follow: eye dryness score (EDS) base on a visual analogue scale (VAS)
   of-6.12 +/- 4.3 points, ocular surface disease index (OSDI)
   questionnaire score of-2.8 +/- 2.3 points, lipid layer thickness (LLT)

   +/- 0.3 points and ocular treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs)
   of-0.66 +/- 1.7. Tear film break-up time (TBUT) was the only variable in
   favor of control group with a mean of-0.5 +/- 0.4 s. Patient
   satisfaction after F6H8 tear substitutes treatment was high. Therefore,
   F6H8 tear substitutes improve dry eye symptoms and signs with a
   satisfactory tolerability and could be recommended in patients with DED.},

Journal = {ECOTOXICOLOGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {266},
Month = {NOV 1},
Abstract = {The persistent organic pollutant 2,2 `,4,4 `-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether
   (BDE-47), a prevalent congener among polybrominated diphenyl ethers
   (PBDEs), exhibits potent bioaccumulation and toxicity. Despite extensive
   research into the adverse effects of BDE-47, its neurotoxicity in sea
   cucumbers remains unexplored. Given the crucial role of the sea
   cucumber's nervous system in survival and adaptation, evaluating the
   impacts of BDE-47 is vital for sustainable aquaculture and consumption.
   In this study, we employed ultra-high-performance liquid
   chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry
   (UPLC-Triple-TOF-MS) to analyze metabolomic changes in neuro-related
   tissues of Apostichopus japonicus exposed to low (0.1 mu g/L), medium
   (1.0 mu g/L), and high (10.0 mu g/L) BDE-47 concentrations. We
   identified significantly changed metabolites in each exposure group (87
   in low, 79 in medium, and 102 in high), affecting a variety of
   physiological processes such as steroid hormone balance, nucleotide
   metabolism, energy metabolism, neurotransmitter levels, and
   neuroprotection. In addition, we identified concentration-dependent,
   common, and some other metabolic responses in the neuro-related tissues.
   Our findings reveal critical insights into the neurotoxic effects of
   BDE-47 in sea cucumbers and contribute to risk assessment related to
   BDE-47 exposure in the sea cucumber industry, paving the way for future
   neurotoxicological research in invertebrates.},

Abstract = {ACE2 as a functional receptor for SARS coronavirus plays an important
   role in COVID-19 infection of the host. Thus, we aimed to explore
   interaction networks between ACE2 and common host factors in
   COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity. We identified 1,191 protein targets closely
   related to ACE2, and integrated the GEO database and multiple public
   databases to identify 305 host factors related to ACE2 between
   COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity. Further enrichment analyses showed that
   metabolic processes, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation and PPAR signaling
   pathways had vital significance in the comorbidity of asthma and
   COIVD-19. HRAS, IFNG, CAT, CDH1, FASN, ACLY, CCL5, VCAM1, SCD and HMGCR
   were the key host factors related to ACE2. Tissue-specific enrichment
   and correlation analysis with ACE2 showed that SCD, CAT and FASN were
   highly expressed in the lung; and these 10 molecules were closely
   related to ACE2 and specifically expressed in multiple tissues. We also
   identified a series of drugs, such as estradiol,
   tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, resveratrol, cyclosporine, perfluorooctanoic
   acid and so on. Finally, the expression levels and diagnostic
   performance of HRAS and SCD showed statistical significance in external
   databases. This study explored the interaction networks of ACE2related
   host factors in COVID-19 and asthma and identified several potential
   drugs for COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity. Although our research needs
   further verification, it still informs the mechanisms and treatment of

Abstract = {This study evaluated the effectiveness of six Technosols designed for
   the remediation of polluted soils (PS) by metal(loid)s at
   physicochemical, biological, and ecotoxicological levels and at a
   microcosm scale. Technosols T1-T6 were prepared by combining PS with a
   mix of organic and inorganic wastes from mining, urban, and
   agro-industrial activities. After two months of surface application of
   Technosols on polluted soils, we analysed the soil properties,
   metal(loid) concentration in total, soluble and bioavailable fractions,
   soil enzymatic activities, and the growth responses of Trifolium
   campestre and Lactuca sativa in both the Technosols and the underlying
   polluted soils. All Technosols improved the unfavourable conditions of
   polluted soils by neutralising acidity, increasing the OC, reducing the
   mobility of most metal(loid)s, and stimulating both the soil enzymatic
   activities and growths of T. campestre and L. sativa. The origin of
   organic waste used in the Technosols strongly conditioned the changes
   induced in the polluted soils; in this sense, the Technosols composed of
   pruning and gardening vermicompost (T3 and T6) showed greater reductions
   in toxicity and plant growth than the other Technosols composed with
   different organic wastes. Thus, these Technosols constitute a potential
   solution for the remediation of persistent polluted soils that should be
   applied in large-scale and long-term interventions to reinforce their
   feasibility as a cost-effective ecotechnology.},

Abstract = {Background: Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and polychlorinated biphenyls
   (PCB) are persistent organic pollutants with potential
   endocrine-disrupting effects linked to adverse health
   outcomes.Objectives: In this study, we utilize high-resolution
   metabolomics (HRM) to identify internal exposure and biological
   responses underlying PCB and multigenerational PBB exposure for
   participants enrolled in the Michigan PBB Registry.Methods: HRM
   profiling was conducted on plasma samples collected from 2013 to 2014
   from a subset of participants enrolled in the Michigan PBB Registry,
   including 369 directly exposed individuals (F0) who were alive when PBB
   mixtures were accidentally introduced into the food chain and 129
   participants exposed to PBB in utero or through breastfeeding, if
   applicable (F1). Metabolome-wide association studies were performed for
   PBB-153 separately for each generation and Sigma PCB (PCB-118, PCB-138,
   PCB-153, and PCB-180) in the two generations combined, as both had
   direct PCB exposure. Metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations were
   evaluated following a well-established untargeted HRM workflow.Results:
   Mean levels were 1.75 ng/mL {[}standard deviation (SD): 13.9] for
   PBB-153 and 1.04 ng/mL (SD: 0.788) for Sigma PCB. Sixty-two and 26
   metabolic features were significantly associated with PBB-153 in F0 and
   F1 {[}false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.2], respectively. There were 2,861
   features associated with Sigma PCB (FDR p<0.2). Metabolic pathway
   enrichment analysis using a bioinformatics tool revealed perturbations
   associated with Sigma PCB in numerous oxidative stress and inflammation
   pathways (e.g., carnitine shuttle, glycosphingolipid, and vitamin B9
   metabolism). Metabolic perturbations associated with PBB-153 in F0 were
   related to oxidative stress (e.g., pentose phosphate and vitamin C
   metabolism) and in F1 were related to energy production (e.g.,
   pyrimidine, amino sugars, and lysine metabolism). Using authentic
   chemical standards, we confirmed the chemical identity of 29 metabolites
   associated with Sigma PCB levels (level 1 evidence).Conclusions: Our
   results demonstrate that serum PBB-153 is associated with alterations in
   inflammation and oxidative stress-related pathways, which differed when
   stratified by generation. We also found that Sigma PCB was associated
   with the downregulation of important neurotransmitters, serotonin, and
   4-aminobutanoate. These findings provide novel insights for future
   investigations of molecular mechanisms underlying PBB and PCB exposure

Abstract = {Rhizoremediation is a promising remediation technology for the removal
   of soil persistent organic pollutants (POPs), especially
   benzo{[}a]pyrene (BaP). However, our understanding of the associations
   among rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microorganisms, and POPs
   degradation in different plant growth stages is limited. We combined
   stable-isotope probing (SIP), high-throughput sequencing, and
   metabolomics to analyze changes in rhizospheric soil metabolites,
   functional microbes, and BaP biodegradation in the early growth stages
   (tillering, jointing) and later stage (booting) of ryegrass. Microbial
   community structures differed significantly among growth stages.
   Metabolisms such as benzenoids and carboxylic acids tended to be
   enriched in the early growth stage, while lipids and organic
   heterocyclic compounds dominated in the later stage. From SIP, eight
   BaP-degrading microbes were identified, and most of which such as
   Ilumatobacter and Singulisphaera were first linked with BaP
   biodegradation. Notably, the relationship between the differential
   metabolites and BaP degra-dation efficiency further suggested that
   BaP-degrading microbes might metabolize BaP directly to produce
   benzenoid metabolites (3-hydroxybenzo{[}a]pyrene), or utilize benzenoids
   (phyllodulcin) to stimulate the co-metabolism of BaP in early growth
   stage; some lipids and organic acids, e.g.
   1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, might provide nutrients for the
   degraders to promote BaP metabolism in later stage. Accordingly, we
   determined that certain rhizospheric metabolites might regulate the
   rhizospheric microbial communities at different growth stages, and shift
   the composition and diversity of BaP-degrading bacteria, thereby
   enhancing in situ BaP degradation. Our study sheds light on POPs
   rhizoremediation mechanisms in petroleum-contaminated soils.},

Title = {Coping with extremes: Alternations in diet, gut microbiota, and hepatic
   metabolic functions in a highland passerine},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {905},
Month = {DEC 20},
Abstract = {In wild animals, diet and gut microbiota interactions are critical
   moderators of metabolic functions and are highly contingent on habitat
   conditions. Challenged by the extreme conditions of high-altitude
   environments, the strategies implemented by highland animals to adjust
   their diet and gut microbial composition and modulate their metabolic
   substrates remain largely unexplored. By employing a typical human
   commensal species, the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus, ETS), as
   a model species, we studied the differences in diet, digestive tract
   morphology and enzyme activity, gut microbiota, and metabolic energy
   profiling between highland (the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, QTP; 3230 m) and
   lowland (Shijiazhuang, Hebei; 80 m) populations. Our results showed that
   highland ETSs had enlarged digestive organs and longer small intestinal
   villi, while no differences in key digestive enzyme activities were
   observed between the two populations. The 18S rRNA sequencing results
   revealed that the dietary composition of highland ETSs were more
   animal-based and less plant-based than those of the lowland ones.
   Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing results suggested that the intestinal
   microbial com-munities were structurally segregated between populations.
   PICRUSt metagenome predictions further indicatedthat the expression
   patterns of microbial genes involved in material and energy metabolism,
   immune system and infection, and xenobiotic biodegradation were
   strikingly different between the two populations. Analysis of liver
   metabolomics revealed significant metabolic differences between highland
   and lowland ETSs in terms of sub-strate utilization, as well as distinct
   sex-specific alterations in glycerophospholipids. Furthermore, the
   interplay between diet, liver metabolism, and gut microbiota suggests a
   dietary shift resulting in corresponding changes in gut microbiota and
   metabolic functions. Our findings indicate that highland ETSs have
   evolved to optimize digestion and absorption, rely on more protein-rich
   foods, and possess gut microbiota tailored to their dietary composition,
   likely adaptive physiological and ecological strategies adopted to cope
   with extreme highland environments.},

Abstract = {The entry of potentially toxic elements (PTEs) into the environment has
   been raised as a problem for various countries. So, this study aimed to
   investigate the PTEs concentration in the environment. In this
   cross-sectional study, Ahvaz city, the capital city of Khuzestan
   province, was divided into 5 areas. At each site, three-date palms were
   selected. Leaves and mesh fibers samples were collected from the young
   palm (3 years) with a maximum trunk height of 3-4 m. Plant leaves
   samples were separated from the middle section of the main leaves area
   of the plant and mesh fibers were selected from the different parts of
   the palm data trunk (top, middle, and bottom of the palm data trunk on
   all four sides of the palm). Then, data palm samples were divided into
   two groups of washed/unwashed. Soil samples were collected from the
   closest point to the palms date at a depth of 0-50 cm including at two
   depths (0-20 cm and 20-40 cm), and then combined to make a composite
   soil sample. After the preparation of samples, PTEs were measured by
   ICP-OES. The highest PTEs concentrations were found in industrial and
   high-traffic sites and the lowest was obtained at the control site. The
   largest bioconcentration factor (BCF) was related to copper (2.34-7.49)
   in mesh fibers samples and in the leaves (1.65) in the control area.
   Principal component analysis (PCA) results showed metal(loid)s (copper,
   nickel, zinc, lead, iron, arsenic, and cobalt) are mostly related to
   brake wear and tire of vehicles and asphalt and road dust, while the
   metals (Manganese, chromium, and cadmium) mostly originate from
   industrial sources. Palm leaves, mesh fibers, and soil can be used as a
   cheap biomonitoring factor for PTEs analysis, especially in industrial
   and high-traffic regions.},

Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) accumulated in the adipose tissue
   can affect the fatty acid and lipid metabolism in the body. Gas
   chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics analysis was
   carried out to study the metabolic changes induced by internal exposure
   to the POPs in mouse skeletal muscle (soleus, plantaris, and
   gastrocnemius), kidney, heart, and lungs. Male donor mice were injected
   with a mixture of 10 POPs at concentrations of 0 x and 5 x
   lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL). Their adipose tissue (AT)
   containing the POP was then grafted onto the host mice and the metabolic
   change of the host mice was monitored for 3 or 21 days. The metabolites
   related to fatty acid and lipid metabolism were studied. For the host
   mice engrafted with POP-containing fat pad, there was dysregulation of
   the fatty acids and glycerides observed in all the organs studied 3 days
   after the graft. However, there was no longer a significant change in
   the metabolites 21 days after the graft. The difference in significant
   values and metabolite regulation in each of the skeletal muscles showed
   that the POP mixture affects different types of skeletal muscle in a
   heterogeneous manner. Fold change analysis showed that certain
   metabolites in the kidney of host mice exposed to POPs for 3 days were
   greatly affected. Using multivariate analysis, apart from the plantaris,
   most treated groups exposed to POPs for 3 days are well distinguished
   from the control groups. However, for host mice exposed to POPs for 21
   days, apart from the kidney and heart, groups are not well-distinguished
   from the control group. This study helps bring new insight into the
   effects of the pollutants mixture released from AT on fatty acid and
   lipid metabolism at different periods and how the dysregulation of
   metabolites might result in diseases associated with the organs.},

   oxidative stresses in rice<i> (Oryza</i><i> sativa</i> L.)},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {335},
Month = {OCT 15},
Abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in agricultural soil often
   triggered metabolic alterations and phytotoxicity in plants, ultimately
   threatening crop quality. Unraveling the phytotoxic mechanisms of POPs
   in crops is critical for evaluating their environmental risks. Herein,
   the molecular mechanism of POP-induced phytotoxicity in rice (Oryza
   sativa L.) was analyzed using metabolic profile, enzyme activity, and
   gene expression as linkages, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons,
   polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalate
   esters. Despite no observable changes in phenotypic traits (e.g.,
   biomass and length of aboveground), the levels of reactive oxygen
   species (ROS) were promoted under stresses of the tested POPs,
   particularly 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), dibutyl
   phthalate (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Metabolomics
   analysis revealed that ROS contents positively correlated with metabolic
   perturbation levels (r = 0.83), among which the galactose metabolism was
   significantly inhibited when exposed to DBP, DEHP, or BDE-47. The
   a-Galactosidase (a-Gal) involved in galactose metabolism was targeted as
   the key enzyme for the phytotoxicity of DBP, DEHP, and BDE-47, which was
   revealed by the inhibition of saccharide levels (45.5-82.1\%), the
   catalytic activity of a-Gal (18.5-24.3\%), and the gene expression
   (28.5-34.5\%). Molecular docking simulation suggested that the three
   POPs occupied the active sites of a-Gal and formed a stable
   protein-ligand complex, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of a-Gal.
   Partial least-squares regression analysis indicated that a-Gal activity
   was negatively associated with hydrogen bond acceptor, rotatable bond,
   and topological polar surface area of POPs. The results offered novel
   insights into the molecular mechanisms of phytotoxicity of POPs and
   provided important information for evaluating the environmental risk of
   POPs.},

Title = {Levels, tissue distribution and isomer stereoselectivity of Dechlorane
   Plus in humans: A critical review},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {903},
Month = {DEC 10},
Abstract = {Exposure of human tissues to Dechlorane Plus (DP) has raised public
   concern because of the multiple health threats it may pose to humans.
   Therefore, it is important to summarize the main findings of previous
   studies on DP in human tissues and to provide potential guidance for
   future studies. In this paper, DP levels in different populations and
   human tissues worldwide since 2009 were systematically reviewed. DP
   levels in human tissues of workers in e-waste dismantling sites in
   Guangdong Province, China (median 190 ng center dot g (-1) lw in serum)
   and DP manufacturing plants in Jiangsu Province, China (mean 857 ng
   center dot g (-1) lw in whole-blood) are the highest reported worldwide.
   DP levels in tissues of the general population in recent studies are
   close to those of residents near ewaste dismantling sites, which should
   be of concern. DP levels in different human tissues were found to be
   positively correlated with a pattern of blood > breast milk > adipose
   tissue. The distribution of DP in different human tissues is mainly
   lipid-driven and may also be influenced by the interaction of DP with
   proteins such as human serum albumin. Most of the past studies
   determined the isomer stereoselectivity of DP in human tissuesonly by
   comparing the composition of DP in commercial DP products and human
   tissues, which lacks evidence of mechanism. Recently, a significantly
   different affinity of DP isomers for proteins was found, which seems to
   confirm the isomer selectivity of DP in human tissues. We simulated the
   binding of DP to human serum albumin and DP to thyroid hormone receptor
   ss by molecular docking and found differences in the binding behavior of
   synDP and anti-DP to the selected proteins. Molecular docking seems to
   be a feasible approach for future studies to predict and reveal the
   mechanisms of DP behavior and health effects in human tissues.},

Abstract = {Heavy metal cations are a typical type of inorganic pollutant that has
   persistent distribution characteristics in aquatic environments and are
   easily adsorbed on carriers, posing serious threats to ecological safety
   and human health. Some studies have shown that the coexistence of
   dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microplastics (MPs) promotes the
   adsorption of heavy metal cations, but the mechanism of promoting the
   adsorption process has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, the
   effect of polystyrene microplastics (PSMPs) on the binding properties of
   Pb2+ onto humic acid (HA) in aquatic environments was investigated by
   spectral analysis and two-dimensional correlation (2D-COS) analysis.
   When PSMPs co-existed with HA, the adsorption capacity of Pb2+
   increased. On the one hand, Pb2+ is directly adsorbed on HA through the
   mechanism of complexation reaction, ion exchange and electrostatic
   interaction. On the other hand, Pb2+ is first adsorbed on PSMPs by
   electrostatic action and indirectly adsorbed on HA in the form of
   PSMPs-Pb2+ owing to the interaction between HA and PSMPs, which
   increases the adsorption amount of Pb2+ on HA. This study is significant
   for studying the migration and regression of heavy metal cation
   contaminants when PSMPs co-exist with DOM in an aqueous environment.},

Abstract = {Indole and its derivatives are typical nitrogen heterocyclic compounds
   and have been of immense concern since they are known for the risk of
   their toxic, recalcitrant, and carcinogenic properties for human,

   pollutants. In this experiment, Acinetobacter towneri NTA1-2A and
   Acinetobacter guillouiae TAT1-6A were used to degrade indole.
   Indole-degradated metabolites were analyzed by metabolomics analysis of
   fermentation broth of these strains using LC-MS/MS. The metabolomics
   analysis showed indole-5-carbonitrile 3-benzoyl (C16H10N2O), dimethyl
   sulfoxide (C2H6OS), deoxyguanosine (C10H13N5O4), Leu (C6H13NO2), and
   N-nitroso-pyrrolidine were indole-degradated metabolites formed by A.
   towneri NTA1-2A while neurine (C5H13NO) and norvaline (C5H11NO2) are
   common metabolites of both strains. The two strains' degradation
   metabolites differed from those reported in other studies, demonstrating
   the diversity of the distinct microbial strains approach to the
   metabolism of indolic compounds. Extracellular enzymes released to
   culture medium by these bacteria were also identified. In conclusion,
   the two bacterial strains have a potential of converting notorious
   indole compound to non-toxic intermediates mediated by enzymes. Hence,
   future study should focus on biochemical pathway and genetic basis for
   indole-degradated metabolites in the two strains.},

   future},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {899},
Month = {NOV 15},
Abstract = {Strict measures have curbed the spread of COVID-19, but waste generation
   and movement limitations have had an unintended impact on the
   environment over the past 3 years (2020-2022). Many studies have
   summarized the observed and potential environmental impacts associated
   with COVID-19, however, only a few have quantified and compared the
   effects of these unintended environmental impacts; moreover, whether
   COVID-19 policy stringency had the same effects on the main
   environmental topic (i.e., CO2 emissions) across the 3 years remains
   unclear. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of
   the recent literature and analyzed the main findings. We found that the
   positive environmental effects of COVID-19 have received more attention
   than the negative ones (50.6 \% versus 35.7 \%), especially in emissions
   reduction (34 \% of total literature). Medical waste (14.5 \%) received
   the highest attention among the negative impacts. Although global
   emission reduction, especially in terms of CO2, has received significant
   attention, the positive impacts were temporary and only detected in
   2020. Strict COVID-19 policies had a more profound and significant
   effect on CO2 emissions in the aviation sector than in the power and
   industry sectors. For example, compared with 2019, international
   aviation related CO2 emissions dropped by 59 \%, 49 \%, and 25 \% in
   2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, while industry related ones dropped
   by only 3.16 \% in 2020. According to our developed evaluation matrix,
   medical wastes and their associated effects, including the persistent
   pollution caused by antibiotic resistance genes, heavy metals and
   microplastics, are the main challenges post the pandemic, especially in
   China and India, which may counteract the temporary environmental
   benefits of COVID-19. Overall, the presented results demonstrate methods
   to quantify the environmental effects of COVID-19 and provide directions
   for policymakers to develop measures to address the associated
   environmental issues in the post-COVID-19 world.},

Abstract = {Pyrethroid insecticides (PIs), a class of structurally similar
   non-persistent organic pollutants, can be degraded and metabolized to
   more toxic, and longer half-life products. In this study, the binding

   spectra showed that the fluorescence quenching mechanism was static.
   According to the binding constant, 4-F-3-PBA (1.53 x 105 L mol-1) was

   IIA (site I). It was found by isothermal titration calorimetry that the
   metabolites and HSA spontaneously combined mainly through hydrogen bond
   and van der Waals interaction. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and
   circular dichroism spectra showed that the metabolites caused slight
   changes in the microenvironment and conformation of HSA. The above
   results were proved by molecular docking. The toxicity properties of the
   metabolites were further analyzed by software, and 4-F-3-PBA was found
   to be more toxic than 3-PBA. Considering the high exposure level of
   these metabolites in food, the environment and human body, it is
   necessary to further explore the toxicity of PIs metabolites.},

Abstract = {Biosolids are byproducts of wastewater treatment. With the increasing
   global population, the amounts of wastewater to be treated are
   expanding, along with the amounts of biosolids generated. The reuse of
   biosolids is now accepted for diversified applications in fields such as
   agriculture, engineering, agro-forestry. However, biosolids are known to
   be potential carriers of compounds that can be toxic to living beings or
   alter the environment. Therefore, biosolid reuse is subject to
   regulations, mandatory analyses are performed on heavy metals,
   persistent organic pollutants or pathogens. Conventional methods for the
   analysis of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants are
   demanding, lengthy, and sometimes unsafe. Here, we propose mass
   spectrometry imaging as a faster and safer method using small amounts of
   material to monitor heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in
   different types of biosolids, allowing for ecological and health risk
   assessment before reuse. Our methodology can be extended to other
   soil-like matrices.
   Mass spectrometry imaging is a suitable tool for the analysis of
   non-cohesive materials. Here, authors show that it can be used to detect
   persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals (HMs) in biosolids
   using small amounts of material with speed and safety.},

Abstract = {Mosses are particularly suitable for recording the accumulation of
   atmospheric substance inputs in large areas at relatively many
   locations. In Europe, this has been done every five years since 1990 as
   part of the European Moss Survey. In this framework, mosses were
   collected at up to 7312 sites in up to 34 countries and chemically
   analyzed for metals (since 1990), nitrogen (since 2005), persistent
   organic pollutants (since 2010) and microplastic (since 2015). The
   present investigation aimed at determining the nitrogen accumulated in
   three-year-old shoots from mosses collected in Germany in 2020 by
   quality-controlled sampling and chemical analysis according to the
   European Moss Survey Protocol (ICP Vegetation 2020). The spatial
   structure of the measurement values was analyzed by means of Variogram
   Analysis, and the respective function was used for
   Kriging-Interpolation. In addition to mapping the nitrogen values
   according to the international classification, maps based on 10
   percentile classes were calculated. Maps for the Moss Survey 2020 data
   were compared with respective maps produced from the 2005 and 2015 Moss
   Survey data. Trends in Germany-wide nitrogen medians over the past three
   campaigns (2005, 2015 and 2020) show that nitrogen medians decreased by
   -2 \% between 2005 and 2015 and increased by +8 \% between 2015 and
   2020. These differences are not significant and do not match the
   emission trends. Therefore, emission register data needs to be
   controlled by monitoring nitrogen deposition with technical and
   biological samplers and deposition modelling.},

Abstract = {The presence of 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid (2,4-D), an
   organochlorine herbicide, in the environment has raised public concern
   as it poses hazard to both humans and the ecosystem. Three potential
   strains having the capability to degrade 2,4-D were isolated from on
   site agricultural soil and identified as Arthrobacter sp. SVMIICT25,
   Sphingomonas sp. SVMIICT11 and Stenotrophomonas sp. SVMIICT13. Over 12
   days of incubation, 81-90\% of 100 mg/L of 2,4-D degradation was
   observed at 2\% inoculum. A shorter lag phase with 80\% of degradation
   efficiency was observed within 5 days when the inoculum size was
   increased to 10\%. Six microbial consortia were prepared by combining
   the isolates along with in-house strains, Bacillus sp. and Pseudomonas
   sp. Consortia R3 (Arthrobacter sp. + Sphingomonas sp.), operated with
   10\% of inoculum, showed 85-90\% degra-dation within 4 days and 98-100\%
   in 9 days. Further, targeted exo-metabolite analysis confirmed the

   data, this study conducted a systematic review of the regularity of
   marine disasters (e.g., storm surges, saltwater intrusions, and red
   tides), water quality variations, water quality risk assessments and
   wastewater treatment in seven sections of the Pearl River Estuary (PRE).
   The total water resources in the PRD have been a decreasing in recent
   years. Seasonal marine disasters occur frequently, causing loss of life
   and economic damage. A monitoring and early-warning system was
   constructed to provide a scientific basis for dealing marine disasters
   response. Based on the water quality monitoring data from the seven main
   PRE sections from 2015 to 2020, chemical properties, heavy metal
   concentrations and comprehensive pollution indices were selected as
   indicators. The water quality of the seven PRE sections, flowing
   westward into the South China Sea improved over time. According to a
   water quality risk assessment, Yamen the estuary nearest the sea is at
   the highest risk. The PRD had a wastewater treatment rate of 97.37\%,
   which was equal to the average of Guangdong Province. These findings can
   be used to predict future trends in estuarine water, quality and inform
   future studies of water quality variations in the PRD.},

Abstract = {The rise in the global population demands an increasing food supply and
   methods to boost agricultural production. Pesticides are necessary for
   agricultural production models, avoiding losses of close to 40\%.
   Nevertheless, the extensive use of pesticides can cause their
   accumulation in the environment, causing problems for human health,
   biota, and ecosystems. Thus, new technologies have emerged to remove
   these wastes efficiently. In recent years, metal and metal oxide
   nanoparticles (MNPs) have been reported as promising catalysts to
   degrade pesticides; however, a systematic understanding of their effect
   on pesticide degradation is still required. Therefore, this study
   focused on a meta-analysis of articles available in Elsevier's Scopus
   and Thomas Reuters Web of Science, found by searching for ``nanoparticle
   pesticide{''} and ``pesticide contamination.{''} After passing different
   filters, the meta-analysis was performed with 408 observations from 94
   reviews, which comprise insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides,
   including organophosphates, organochlorines, carbamates, triazines, and
   neonicotinoids. Herein, 14 different MNPs (Ag, Ni, Pd, Co3O4, BiOBr, Au,
   ZnO, Fe, TiO2, Cu, WO3, ZnS, SnO2, and Fe-0), improved pesticide
   degradation, with the highest degradation rates achieved by Ag (85\%)
   and Ni (82.5\%). Additionally, the impact of the MNP functionalization,
   size, and concentration on pesticide degradation was quantified and
   compared. In general, the degradation rate increased when the MNPs were
   functionalized (similar to 70\%) compared to naked (similar to 49\%).
   Also, the particle size significantly affected the degradation of
   pesticides. To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis
   performed about the impact of MNPs on pesticide degradation, providing
   an essential scientific basis for future studies.},

Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {452},
Month = {JUN 15},
Abstract = {As the most commonly used organochlorine pesticide nowadays,
   chlorothalonil (CHI), is ubiquitous in a natural environment and poses
   many adverse effects to organisms. Unfortunately, the toxicity
   mechanisms of CHI have not been clarified yet. This study found that the
   CHI based on ADI level could induce obesity in mice. In addition, CHI
   could induce an imbalance in the gut microbiota of mice. Furthermore,
   the results of the antibiotic treatment and gut microbiota
   transplantation experiments showed that the CHI could induce obesity in
   mice in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Based on the results of
   targeted metabolomics and gene expression analysis, CHI could disturb
   the bile acids (BAs) metabolism of mice, causing the inhibition of the
   signal response of BAs re-ceptor FXR and leading to glycolipid
   metabolism disorders in liver and epiWAT of mice. The administration of
   FXR agonist GW4064 and CDCA could significantly improve the CHI-induced
   obesity in mice. In conclusion, CHI was found to induce obesity in mice
   by regulating the gut microbiota and BAs metabolism via the FXR
   signaling pathway. This study provides evidence linking the gut
   microbiota and pesticides exposure with the progression of obesity,
   demonstrating the key role of gut microbiota in the toxic effects of
   pesticides.},

Abstract = {Aromatic hydrocarbons are persistent pollutants in aquatic systems as
   endocrine disruptors, significantly impacting natural ecosystems and
   human health. Microbes perform as natural bioremediators to remove and
   regulate aromatic hydrocarbons in the marine ecosystem. The present
   study focuses upon the comparative di-versity and abundance of various
   hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes and their pathways from deep sediments
   along the Gulf of Kathiawar Peninsula and Arabian Sea, India. The
   elucidation of large number of degradation pathways in the study area
   under the presence of a wide range of pollutants whose fate needs to be
   addressed. Sediment core samples were collected, and the whole
   microbiome was sequenced. Analysis of the predicted ORFs (open reading
   frames) against the AromaDeg database revealed 2946 aromatic
   hydrocarbon-degrading enzyme sequences. Statistical analysis portrayed
   that the Gulfs were more diverse in degradation pathways compared to the
   open sea, with the Gulf of Kutch being more prosperous and more diverse
   than the Gulf of Cambay. The vast majority of the annotated ORFs
   belonged to groups of dioxygenases that included catechol, gentisate,
   and benzene dioxygenases, along with Rieske (2Fe-2S) and vicinal oxygen
   chelate (VOC) family proteins. From the sampling sites, only 960 of the
   total predicted genes were given taxonomic annotations, which mention
   the presence of many under-explored marine microorganism-derived
   hydrocarbon degrading genes and pathways. Through the present study, we
   tried to unveil the array of catabolic pathways of aromatic hydrocarbon
   degra-dation and genes from a marine ecosystem that upholds economic and
   ecological significance in India. Thus, this study provides vast
   opportunities and strategies for microbial resource recovery in marine
   ecosystems, which can be investigated to explore aromatic hydrocarbon
   degradation and their potential mechanisms under various oxic or anoxic
   environments. Future studies should focus on aromatic hydrocarbon
   degradation by considering degradation pathways, biochemical analysis,
   enzymatic, metabolic, and genetic systems, and regulations.},

Abstract = {Thyroid cancer incidence has been steadily rising since the 1970s and
   exposure to environmental pollutants, including persistent organic
   pollutants such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and other
   dioxins, has emerged as a potential explanation for this increase. This
   study aimed to summarize available human studies on the association
   between TCDD exposure and thyroid cancer. A systematic review of the
   literature was per-formed searching the National Library of Medicine and
   National Institutes of Health PubMed, Embase, and Scopus databases,
   through January 2022, using the following keywords: ``thyroid{''},
   ``2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin{''}, ``TCDD{''}, ``dioxin{''}, and
   ``Agent Orange{''}. Six studies were included in this review. Three
   studies evaluated the acute exposure to the chemical factory accident in
   Seveso, Italy, and found a non-significant in-crease in the risk of
   thyroid cancer. Two studies investigating Agent Orange exposure among
   United States Vietnam War veterans found a significant risk of thyroid
   cancer following exposure. No association was found in one study
   evaluating TCDD exposure through herbicides. The current study
   highlights the limited information on the potential association between
   TCDD exposure and thyroid cancer and thus the need for future human
   studies, especially considering the persistent human exposure to dioxins

Abstract = {Chlorinated organic pollutants (COPs) were widely detected in anaerobic
   environments while there is limited understanding of their pollution
   status and potential environmental risks. Here, we applied meta-analysis
   to identify the occurrence status, pollution sources, and environmental
   risk of COPs from 246 peer-published literature, including 25 kinds of
   COPs from 977 sites. The results showed that the median concentrations
   of COPs were at the ng g-1 level. By the combination of principal
   component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF), we
   established 7 pollution sources for COPs. Environmental risk assessment
   found 73.3\% of selected sites were at a security level but the rest
   were not, especially for the wetlands. The environmental risk of COPs
   was usually underestimated by the existing evaluation methods, such as
   without the consideration of the non-extractable residues (NER) and the
   multi-process coupling effect. Especially, the synergetic coupling
   asso-ciations between dechlorination and methanogenesis might increase
   the risk of methane emission that has barely been previously considered
   in previous risk assessment approaches. Our results expanded the

Title = {E-waste in Vietnam: a narrative review of environmental contaminants and
   potential health risks},
Journal = {REVIEWS ON ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH},
Year = {2023},
Month = {2023 FEB 9},
Abstract = {Informal electronic waste (e-waste) dismantling activities contribute to
   releasing hazardous compounds in the environment and potential exposure
   to humans and their health. These hazardous compounds include persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and
   heavy metals. This review searched papers addressing hazardous compounds
   emitted from e-waste recycling activities and their health effects in
   Vietnam. Based on the keywords searched in three electronic databases
   (PubMed, Psych Info, and Google scholar), we found 21 relevant studies
   in Vietnam. The review identifies extensive e-waste dismantling
   activities in Vietnam in the northern region. To measure the
   environmental exposure to hazardous compounds, samples such as e-waste
   recycling workshop dust, soil, air, and sediments were assessed, while
   human exposure levels were measured using participants' hair, serum, or
   breast milk samples. Studies that compared levels of exposure in e-waste
   recycling sites and reference sites indicated higher levels of PBDEs,
   PCBs, and heavy metals were observed in both environmental and human
   samples from participants in e-waste recycling sites. Among
   environmental samples, hazardous chemicals were the most detected in
   dust from e-waste recycling sites. Considering both environmental and
   human samples, the highest exposure difference observed with PBDE ranged
   from 2-48-fold higher in e-waste processing sites than in the reference
   sites. PCBs showed nearly 3-fold higher levels in e-waste processing
   sites than in reference sites. In the e-waste processing sites,
   age-specific higher PCB levels were observed in older recycler's serum
   samples. Among the heavy metals, Pb was highly detected in drinking
   water, indoor soil and human blood samples. While high detection of Ni
   in cooked rice, Mn in soil and diet, Zn in dust and As in urine were
   apparent. Exposure assessment from human biomonitoring showed
   participants, including children and mothers from the e-waste processing
   areas, had higher carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks than the
   reference sites. This review paper highlights the importance of further
   comprehensive studies on risk assessments of environmentally hazardous
   substances and their association with health outcomes at e-waste
   processing sites.},

Title = {Organic Rice Production Practices: Effects on Grain End-Use Quality,
   Healthfulness, and Safety},
Journal = {FOODS},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {12},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Demand for rice labeled as organic is growing globally. Consumers state
   that foods labeled as organic are nutritionally superior and safer than
   their conventionally produced equivalent. The research question for this
   systematic review is as follows: is there a difference between the
   effects of sustainable agriculture and conventional farming methods on
   rice grain end-use quality, healthfulness, and safety? The studies (n =
   23) examined for this review suggest that organic production practices
   don't influence most end-use quality (e.g., chalk, milling yield,
   pasting properties) and healthfulness (e.g., gamma-oryzanol fraction and
   tocols) traits studied, or if it does, it will be to a small degree. If
   differences in end-use quality traits are found, they will be associated
   with grain protein content, which varies along with the dose of nitrogen
   applied during rice growth. We conclude that the studies evaluated in
   this review found that organically produced rice grain was less likely
   to contain residues of the pesticides (e.g., organochlorine) examined in
   the study than the rice is grown using conventional methods. There was
   some evidence that organically grown rice is more likely to be
   contaminated with mycotoxin-producing fungi and some mycotoxins. Common
   shortcomings of the studies were that they were poorly designed, with
   limited to no details of the cultural management practices used to grow
   the rice studied, the length of time fields was under organic management
   not stated, cultivars were not named, and the data wasn't analyzed
   statistically.},

Journal = {TECHNOLOGY IN CANCER RESEARCH \& TREATMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {22},
Abstract = {Theranostic agents are promising due to their ability to diagnose, treat
   and monitor different types of cancer using a variety of imaging
   modalities. The advantage specifically of nanoparticles is that they can
   accumulate easily at the tumor site due to the large gaps in blood
   vessels near tumors. Such high concentration of theranostic agents at
   the target site can lead to enhancement in both imaging and therapy.
   This article provides an overview of nanoparticles that have been used
   for cancer theranostics, and the different imaging, treatment options
   and signaling pathways that are important when using nanoparticles for
   cancer theranostics. In particular, nanoparticles made of metal elements
   are emphasized due to their wide applications in cancer theranostics.
   One important aspect discussed is the ability to combine different types
   of metals in one nanoplatform for use as multimodal imaging and

Title = {Metagenomic insight of fluorene-boosted sludge acidogenic fermentation:
   Metabolic transformation of amino acids and monosaccharides},
Journal = {SCIENCE OF THE TOTAL ENVIRONMENT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {865},
Month = {MAR 20},
Abstract = {Fluorene (Flu) occurs widely in various environments and its toxicity to
   organisms is well-known. However, the impact of Flu on complicated
   biochemical processes involving functional microbial community has been
   reported rarely. In this study, the facilitation of Flu on the volatile
   fatty acids (VFAs) generation executed by acidogenic microbial
   population during sludge acidogenic fermentation (37 degrees C, SRT = 8
   d, pH = 10.0) was investigated. The accumulation of VFAs (particularly
   acetic acid) increased initially and then declined with the increasing
   of Flu concentration (0-500 mg/kg dry sludge), which reached a maximum
   (3211.1 mg COD/L) as Flu content was 200 mg/kg dry sludge. The
   Fluenhanced VFAs production was primarily attributed to the shift of
   hydrolysis/acidification, as well as the corresponding functional
   microbial community and the activity of enzymes. Based on the
   metagenomics analysis, the conversion of organic substrates, i.e. amino
   acid and monosaccharide, into VFAs embraced in hydrolysis/acidification
   shaped by Flu was constructed at the genetic level. The relative
   abundances of genes included in aminotransfer and deamination process of
   amino acid and glycolysis of monosaccharide into VFA-precursors
   (pyruvate, acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA), and the further formation of
   VFAs were improved due to the Flu presence. This study shed light on the
   Flu-affected microbial processes at the molecular biology level during
   acidogenic fermentation and was of great significance in resource
   recovery of sludge containing persistent organic pollutants.},

Title = {Combined toxicity of micro/nanoplastics loaded with environmental
   pollutants to organisms and cells: Role, effects, and mechanism},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENT INTERNATIONAL},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {171},
Month = {JAN},
Abstract = {Micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) are ubiquitous in the environment and
   living organisms have been exposed to these substances for a long time.
   When MPs/NPs enter different organisms, they transport various
   pollutants, including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants,
   drugs, bacteria, and viruses, from the environment. On this basis, this
   paper summarizes the combined toxicity induced by MPs/NPs accumulating
   contaminants from the environment and entering organisms through a
   systematic review of 162 articles. Moreover, the factors influ-encing
   toxic interactions are critically discussed, thus highlighting the
   dominant role of the relative concen-trations of contaminants in the
   combined toxic effects. Furthermore, for the first time, we describe the
   threats posed by MPs/NPs combined with other pollutants to human health,
   as well as their cytotoxic behavior and mechanism. We found that the
   ``Trojan horse{''} effect of nanoplastics can increase the
   bioaccessibility of envi-ronmental pollutants, thus increasing the
   carcinogenic risk to humans. Simultaneously, the complex pollutants
   entering the cells are observed to be constantly dissociated due to the
   transport of lysosomes. However, current research on the intracellular
   release of MP/NP-loaded pollutants is relatively poor, which hinders the
   accurate in vivo toxicity assessment of combined pollutants. Based on
   the findings of our critical review, we recommend analyzing the toxic
   effects by clarifying the dose relationship of each component pollutant
   in cells, which is challenging yet crucial to exploring the toxic
   mechanism of combined pollution. In the future, our findings can
   contribute to establishing a system modeling the complete
   load-translocation toxicological mechanism of MP/ NP-based composite
   pollutants.},

Title = {Intraluminal oxygen mitigates acute mesenteric ischaemia: a systematic

Journal = {ANZ JOURNAL OF SURGERY},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {93},
Number = {4},

Month = {APR},
Abstract = {BackgroundAcute Mesenteric Ischaemic (AMI) is a rare condition with
   significant morbidity and mortality. Many causes of AMI exist, which
   usually begin with mucosal injury. Onset is insiduous and there is
   frequent diagnostic delay. Current treatments can only control
   established injury and prevent propagation, hence new interventions are
   needed. The prevention and treatment of AMI by intraluminal delivery of
   oxygen has yet to be investigated in the clinical setting. This article
   aims to systemically review experimental studies investigating this
   novel therapy. MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, searches of
   PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were performed up to June 2022. Two
   independent investigators extracted the data. ResultsThere were 20
   experimental studies, 16 of which used an occlusive ischaemia
   reperfusion model. Six different formulations were used to deliver
   intraluminal oxygen, with perflurocarbon being the most common. Studies
   consistently showed local and systemic benefits. Intraluminal oxygen
   therapy improved histological severity of mucosal injury in all studies
   when oxygen was delivered during the ischaemia phase, but could cause
   harm if given during the reperfusion phase. Improvement was also
   demonstrated in endpoints assessing intestinal function, biomarkers of
   intestinal damage, measures of systemic physiological derangement and
   mortality. ConclusionIntraluminal oxygenation appears to be an effective
   treatment for AMI. There remain significant questions regarding optimal
   timing and delivery formulation before clinical translation of this
   treatment strategy.},

Title = {Production and possible reduction of greenhouse gases produced during GI

Journal = {GUT},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {72},
Number = {3},
Pages = {493-500},
Month = {MAR},
Abstract = {Background and aimsGreenhouse gases (GHGs) that trap heat in the
   atmosphere are composed of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane, nitrous oxide
   and fluorinated gases (synthetic hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons
   and nitrogen trifluoride). In the USA, the health sector accounts for
   8.5\% of total GHG emissions. The primary objective of this systematic
   review was to critically analyse the carbon emissions data from GI
   endoscopic activity. DesignThe GI endoscopy carbon cycle was evaluated
   at preprocedural, intraprocedural and postprocedural levels. We
   performed a systematic literature search of articles published on these
   issues until 30 June 2022 and discussed these available data on
   endoscopy unit GHG carbon cycle, barriers to reduce GHG emissions and
   potential solutions. The inclusion criteria were any full-text articles
   (observational, clinical trials, brief communications, case series and
   editorials) reporting waste generation from GI endoscopy. Abstracts,
   news articles and conference proceedings were excluded. ResultsOur
   search yielded 393 records in PubMed, 1708 in Embase and 24 in Google
   Scholar. After application of inclusion and exclusion factors, we
   focused on 9 fulllength articles in detail, only 3 of them were
   cross-sectional studies (all from the USA), the others reviews or
   position statements. Therefore, the quality of the studies could not be
   assessed due to heterogeneity in definitions and amount of emissions.
   ConclusionsRecognition of carbon emissions generated by GI endoscopy
   activity is critical. Although multiple limitations exists for
   quantification of these emission, there is an urgent need for collecting
   proper data as well as examining novel methods for reduction of these
   emissions for a sustainable endoscopic practices in the future.},

Journal = {FRONTIERS IN MICROBIOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {13},

Abstract = {Dichloromethane (DCM; CH2Cl2) is a widespread pollutant with
   anthropogenic and natural sources. Anaerobic DCM-dechlorinating bacteria
   use the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, yet dechlorination reaction mechanisms
   remain unclear and the enzyme(s) responsible for carbon-chlorine bond
   cleavage have not been definitively identified. Of the three bacterial
   taxa known to carry out anaerobic dechlorination of DCM, `Candidatus
   Formimonas warabiya' strain DCMF is the only organism that can also
   ferment non-chlorinated substrates, including quaternary amines (i.e.,
   choline and glycine betaine) and methanol. Strain DCMF is present within
   enrichment culture DFE, which was derived from an
   organochlorine-contaminated aquifer. We utilized the metabolic
   versatility of strain DCMF to carry out comparative metaproteomics of
   cultures grown with DCM or glycine betaine. This revealed differential
   abundance of numerous proteins, including a methyltransferase gene
   cluster (the mec cassette) that was significantly more abundant during
   DCM degradation, as well as highly conserved amongst anaerobic
   DCM-degrading bacteria. This lends strong support to its involvement in
   DCM dechlorination. A putative glycine betaine methyltransferase was
   also discovered, adding to the limited knowledge about the fate of this
   widespread osmolyte in anoxic subsurface environments. Furthermore, the
   metagenome of enrichment culture DFE was assembled, resulting in five
   high quality and two low quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes.
   Metaproteogenomic analysis did not reveal any genes or proteins for
   utilization of DCM or glycine betaine in the cohabiting bacteria,
   supporting the previously held idea that they persist via necromass
   utilization.},

Volume = {30},
Number = {4},

Abstract = {Environmental pollution caused by persistent organic pollutants (POPs)
   has increased the challenge for the scientific communities.
   Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), classified as POPs, are widely
   applied in various materials as brominated flame retardants (BFRs).
   Because of the nature of these chemical compounds including toxicity,
   stability, and capability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify, PBDEs have
   posed a great challenge and risk to human health and wildlife.
   Therefore, the side effects of exposure to PBDEs as ubiquitous
   pollutants in the environment on cancer progression were investigated
   using a systematic review (SR) survey. To achieve this goal, forty
   studies were considered after defining the search terms and inclusion
   criteria, and/or exclusion criteria; the eligible records were collected
   from the international bibliographic databases. Based on the findings of
   the reviewed records, environmental exposure to the BFRs including PBDEs
   has a positive association with different mechanisms that induce cancer
   progression. However, the findings of the reviewed studies were not
   totally consistent with the mode of action and side effects are yet to
   be fully elucidated. Several articles have reported that BFRs can be
   carcinogenic and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition via
   different mechanisms. The main mode of action involved in the
   environmental exposure to BFRs and the risk of cancer progression is
   endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress (OS). Generally, the
   imbalance of antioxidant mechanisms, reactive nitrogen species (RNSs)
   and reactive oxygen species (ROSs), during damage in cells, and stress
   caused OS, which increases tumorigenesis via multiple mechanisms, such
   as DNA damage, inflammation, and angiogenesis.},

Abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated
   transcriptional factor that mediates the toxicities of several
   environmental pollutants. Decades of research have been carried out to
   understand the role of AhR as a novel mechanism for disease development.
   Its involvement in the pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular diseases,
   rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus have long been
   known. One of the current hot research topics is investigating the role
   of AhR activation by environmental pollutants on glucose homeostasis and
   insulin secretion, and hence the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. To
   date, epidemiological studies have suggested that persistent exposure to
   environmental contaminants such as dioxins, with subsequent AhR
   activation increases the risk of specific comorbidities such as obesity
   and diabetes. The importance of AhR signaling in various molecular
   pathways highlights that the role of this receptor is far beyond just
   xenobiotic metabolism. The present review aims at providing significant
   insight into the physiological and pathological role of AhR and its
   regulated enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and CYP1B1 in
   both types of diabetes. It also provides a comprehensive summary of the
   current findings of recent research studies investigating the role of
   the AhR/CYP1A1 pathway in insulin secretion and glucose hemostasis in
   the pancreas, liver, and adipose tissues. This review further highlights
   the molecular mechanisms involved, such as gluconeogenesis,
   hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), oxidative stress, and inflammation.},

   high surface area as well as the affinity toward many analytes related
   to the ability to establish different types of interactions, PANI has a
   great potential as a sorbent in sample pretreatment before instrumental
   analyses. This study provides an overview of the applications of
   polyaniline and polyaniline composites as sorbents in sample preparation
   techniques based on solid-phase extraction, including conventional
   solid-phase extraction (SPE) and its modifications, solid-phase
   microextraction (SPME), dispersive solid-phase extraction (dSPE),
   magnetic solid-phase extraction (MSPE) and stir-bar sorptive extraction
   (SBSE). The utility of PANI-based sorbents in chromatography was also
   summarized. It has been shown that polyaniline is willingly combined
   with other components and PANI-based materials may be formed in a
   variety of shapes. Polyaniline alone and PANI-based composites were
   successfully applied for sample preparation before determination of
   various analytes, both metal ions and organic compounds, in different
   matrices such as environmental samples, food, human plasma, urine, and
   blood.},

Abstract = {Scientific understanding of trophic magnification factors (TMFs) is
   conducive to formulating environmental management measures. Trophic
   position (TP) of species is the key parameter in TMFs assessment.
   Nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15) provide a powerful tool to
   estimate TP. However, some limitations could introduce considerable
   uncertainty into TP and TMFs assessment which mainly includes: 1)
   determination of Delta N-15 between two adjacent trophic positions; 2)
   determination of baseline species. Different from the widely used
   constant Delta N-15 (3.4\%) between two adjacent trophic positions,
   which is called additive Delta N-15 framework, Delta N-15 gradually
   decreases as trophic position increases under scaled Delta N-15
   framework, which has been confirmed by more and more laboratory studies
   and meta-analyses. In this study, we sampled in two similar littoral
   ecosystems separated by one natural dam, which is called Small Xingkai
   Lake and Xingkai Lake, analyzed the delta N-15 and totalmercury (THg) of
   each species. On the one hand, we compared the TP of species under the
   additive Delta N-15 framework and scaled Delta N-15 framework with the
   White shrimp (Exopalaemon modestus) as baseline species in two lakes
   respectively. On the other hand, we explored the possible changes in
   TMFs based on TP. Our results show, under the scaled Delta N-15
   framework, the trophic position of the same species is higher, while
   TMFs is lower compared with the additive Delta N-15 framework; even if
   in the two interconnected lakes, distributed the same baseline species,
   in the similar ecosystem, separate baselines should also be used. In
   this study, two frameworks of the food chain were compared in two
   interconnected freshwater ecosystems for the first time. The difference
   between TMFs of two lakes was obvious under scaled framework but not
   under additive framework. We also recommend that future TMFs assessments
   should be based on the scaled Delta N-15 framework because it has
   improved the accuracy of trophic position assessment.},

   Profiles, accumulation dynamics, and risks for human consumers},
Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},

Abstract = {Chemical pollution is a major threat to marine ecosystems, and top
   predators such as most shark species are extremely vulnerable to being
   exposed and accumulating contaminants such as metals and persistent
   organic pollutants (POPs). This work aimed to study the degree,
   composition, and the sources of contamination in the blue shark
   (Prionace glauca) inhabiting the Northeast Atlantic, as well as the
   potential risk faced by human consumers. A total of 60 sharks were
   sampled in situ aboard fishing vessels, and the concentrations of a set
   of metals and POPs were analysed in various tissues and complemented
   with stable isotope analyses. High levels of contaminants were found in
   most sharks sampled. The concentrations of most metals were higher in
   the muscle when compared with the liver. Regarding the dangers to
   consumers posed by the concentrations of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and
   lead (Pb), over 75\% of the sharks presented muscle concentrations of at
   least one contaminant above the legal limits for human consumption, and
   a risk assessment determined that consumption of meat of these sharks
   exceeding 0.07 Kg per week could potentially expose human consumers to
   dangerous amounts of methylmercury (MeHg). Additionally, the assessment
   of single contaminants may lead to an underestimation of the risk for
   the human health. Finally, the overall accumulation of contaminants
   seems to be mostly influenced by the sharks' geographical distribution,
   rather than sex, size, or trophic level of their prey.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION},
Year = {2023},
Volume = {316},
Number = {1},
Month = {JAN 1},
Abstract = {Sea turtles are considered pollution bioindicators due to their tendency
   to accumulate high metal levels in their tissues during their long
   lifespans. In this context, we aimed to analyse the concentrations of 12
   elements in liver, kidney, heart and muscle samples from green turtles
   (Chelonia mydas; n = 41) and loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta; n =
   14) found stranded in Northern Cyprus. The samples were collected
   between 2019 and 2021, stored in sterile Eppendorf tubes at -20 degrees
   C until metal analysis, and analysed with an inductively coupled plasma
   mass spectrometer. With this study, we contribute to the limited number
   of studies on metal accumulation in heart tissue and present the first
   data for Mg accumulation in the heart, liver, muscle and kidney tissues
   of both species. We found that metal accumulation levels differed among
   the two study species' tissues, with some elements in the same tissue
   (Al-Kidney, As-Heart, As-Liver, Fe-Muscle, Fe-Kidney, Fe-Heart,
   Mn-Heart, Pb-Heart, Zn-Muscle and Zn-Kidney) significantly differing
   between species. The observed variation likely resulted from their
   different feeding habits, which cause them to be exposed to different
   levels of metals. We also found significant associations among elements
   within tissues, as well as between the same element across different
   tissues in both species, which may indicate the differential
   accumulation of elements among organs due to physiological processes in
   turtle metabolism, bioaccumulation or excretion.},

   pesticide exposure and cancer induction},
Journal = {TOXICOLOGY AND APPLIED PHARMACOLOGY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {456},
Month = {DEC 1},
Abstract = {Introduction: Pesticides are toxic and biological substances used for
   mitigating harmful pests. Their application in agricultural fields and
   homes increased environmental pollution. Studies showed their harmful
   effects on human health, specifically children, who are more vulnerable
   than adults. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has
   introduced several pesticides as carcinogens. This study aims to
   systematically summarize and review all studies related to pesticides
   and cancer. Methodology: This systematic review is based on PRISMA
   rules. Three central databases were employed to find studies on
   pesticide exposure and cancer correlation published from 2017 to
   September 2022. Results: After reviewing several studies, we found that
   most studies revealed a significant relationship between pesticide
   exposure and an increased cancer incidence rate. Among the most studied
   group of pesticides is organochlorine (OC) pesticides. OC pesticides and
   their residues could significantly increase cancer in children and
   adults. Mechanistic studies revealed that pesticides could increase the
   risk of different cancers by genetics, like an increased expression of
   some genes like p21, p53 or epigenetic impairments. Cell cycle
   impairments like expanding the G1 to S phase transition are another
   mechanism of causing cancer. DNA methylation and histone modifications
   increase the risk of numerous cancers. Conclusion: Based on
   epidemiological studies, pesticides are a significant concern to human
   health, specifically cancer development, and should be more restrained.
   Their most reported mechanism of action were genetic and epigenetic
   impairments which cause cancers.},

Journal = {REACTIVE \& FUNCTIONAL POLYMERS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {181},
Month = {DEC},
Abstract = {The development of a novel energetic block copolymer of glycidyl azide
   polymer (GAP) and fluoropolymer (FP) using a boron
   trifluoride-tetrahydrofuran complex/diol initiator system is reported
   herein. Well-defined com-positions of the GAP-FP copolymers in two
   different GAP to FP ratios (1:1 and 1:3) were synthesized by tailoring
   the desired molecular weights of each block in the copolymer,
   demonstrating the synthetic versatility of such a copolymer system. The
   resultant GAP-FP copolymers represent a unique hybrid binder system with
   tunable energy releasing and oxidizing potentials intended for
   metallized formulations. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the
   carbonaceous residue usually formed from the decomposition of GAP could
   be reduced significantly by the copolymerization with FP.
   Isoconversional method of kinetic analysis of the GAP-FP co-polymers
   revealed an increasing dependence of the effective activation energy on
   the extent of conversion. The increasing dependence suggested a
   mechanism of the competing reactions that were found to be between the
   reactions of FP triggered oxidation and intermolecular crosslinking of
   the polyimine intermediates formed from GAP decomposition that
   ultimately resulted in the reduction of the carbonaceous residue.},

Abstract = {Evidence supports the potential influence of persistent organic
   pollutants (POPs) on the pathogenesis and progression of obesity and
   diabetes. Diet-toxicant interactions appear to be important in
   diet-induced obesity/diabetes; however, the factors influencing this
   interaction, especially the early life environmental exposure, are
   unclear. Herein, we investigated the metabolic effects following early
   life five-day exposure (24 mu g/kg body weight per day) to 3,3 `,4,4
   `,5-pentacholorobiphenyl (PCB 126) at four months after exposure in mice
   fed with control (CTRL) or high-fat diet (HFD). Activation of aryl
   hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling as well as higher levels of liver
   nucleotides were observed at 4 months after PCB 126 exposure in mice,
   independent of diet status. Inflammatory responses including higher
   levels of serum cytokines and adipose inflammatory gene expression
   caused by early life PCB 126 were observed only in HFD-fed mice in
   adulthood. Notably, early life PCB 126 exposure worsened HFD-induced
   impaired glucose homeostasis characterized by glucose intolerance and
   elevated gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux without
   worsening the effects of HFD related to adiposity in adulthood.
   Furthermore, early life PCB 126 exposure resulted in diet-dependent
   changes in bacterial community structure and function later in life, as
   indicated by metagenomic and metabolomic analyses. These data contribute
   to a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between diet
   and early life environmental chemical exposure.},

Title = {Unveiling degradation mechanism of PAHs by a <i>Sphingobium</i> strain
   from a microbial consortium},
Journal = {MLIFE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {1},
Number = {3},
Pages = {287-302},
Month = {SEP},
Abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of persistent
   pollutants with adverse biological effects and pose a serious threat to
   ecological environments and human health. The previously isolated
   phenanthrene-degrading bacterial consortium (PDMC) consists of the
   genera Sphingobium and Pseudomonas and can degrade a wide range of PAHs.
   To identify the degradation mechanism of PAHs in the consortium PDMC,
   metagenomic binning was conducted and a Sphingomonadales assembly genome
   with 100\% completeness was obtained. Additionally, Sphingobium sp.
   SHPJ-2, an efficient degrader of PAHs, was successfully isolated from
   the consortium PDMC. Strain SHPJ-2 has powerful degrading abilities and
   various degradation pathways of high-molecular-weight PAHs, including
   fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo{[}a]anthracene, and chrysene. Two
   ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases, five cytochrome P450s, and a pair of
   electron transfer chains associated with PAH degradation in strain
   SHPJ-2, which share 83.0\%-99.0\% similarity with their corresponding
   homologous proteins, were identified by a combination of
   Sphingomonadales assembly genome annotation, reverse-transcription
   quantitative polymerase chain reaction and heterologous expression.
   Furthermore, when coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with the
   appropriate electron transfer chain, PhnA1B1 could effectively degrade
   chrysene and benzo{[}a]anthracene, while PhnA2B2 degrade fluoranthene.
   Altogether, these results provide a comprehensive assessment of strain
   SHPJ-2 and contribute to a better understanding of the molecular
   mechanism responsible for the PAH degradation.},

Title = {Remediation techniques for elimination of heavy metal pollutants from

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {214},
Number = {4},
Month = {NOV},
Abstract = {Contaminated soil containing toxic metals and metalloids is found
   everywhere globally. As a consequence of adsorption and precipitation
   reactions, metals are comparatively immobile in subsurface systems.
   Hence remediation techniques in such contaminated sites have targeted
   the solid phase sources of metals such as sludges, debris, contaminated
   soils, or wastes. Over the last three decades, the accumulation of these
   toxic substances inside the soil has increased dramatically, putting the
   ecosystem and human health at risk. Pollution of heavy metal have posed
   severe impacts on human, and it affects the environment in different
   ways, resulting in industrial anger in many countries. Various
   procedures, including chemical, biological, physical, and inte-grated
   approaches, have been adopted to get rid of this type of pollution.
   Expenditure, timekeeping, planning challenges, and state-of-the-art
   gadget involvement are some drawbacks that need to be properly handled.
   Recently in situ metal immobilization, plant restoration, and biological
   methods have changed the dynamics and are considered the best solution
   for removing metals from soil. This review paper critically evaluates
   and ana-lyzes the numerous approaches for preparing heavy metal-free
   soil by adopting different soil remediation methods.},

Journal = {ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {214},

Abstract = {A human biomonitoring study was carried out in 2015 within an adult
   population living in Liege (Belgium). Some phthalate metabolites and
   parabens were measured in the urine of 252 participants, and information
   were collected about their food habits, life styles and home environment
   to identify some predictors of exposure. Concomitantly, an awareness
   campaign was initiated by the Provincial Authorities of Liege and spread
   over 2 years. Three years later (2018), 92 of the initial participants
   provided again urine samples, and the levels of phthalate metabolites,
   phthalate substitute (DINCH), parabens, bisphenol-A and bisphenol
   alternatives (bisphenol-S, -F,-Z,-P) were determined and compared to
   those obtained in 2015 to assess time trends. In 2015, methyl- and
   ethylparaben were the most abundant parabens (P50 = 9.12 mu g/L and 1.1
   mu g/L respectively), while propyl- and butylparaben were sparsely
   detected. Except for mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and
   6-OH-mono-propyl-heptyl phthalate, all other targeted phthalate
   metabolites were positively quantified in most of the urine samples
   (between 89 and 98\%) with median concentrations ranging between 2.7 mu
   g/L and 21.3 mu g/L depending on the metabolite. The multivariate
   regression models highlighted some significant associations between
   urinary phthalate metabolite or paraben levels and age, rural or urban
   character of the residence place, and the use of some personal care
   products. However, all determination coefficients were weak meaning that
   the usual covariates included in the models only explained a small part
   of the variance. Between 2015 and 2018, levels of parabens and phthalate
   metabolites significantly decreased (from 1.3 to 2.5 fold) except for
   monoethyl phthalate which seemed to remain quite constant. Contrariwise,
   all bisphenol alternatives and DINCH metabolites were measured in higher
   concentrations in 2018 vs 2015 while BPA levels did not differ
   significantly. However, it was not feasible to unequivocally highlight
   an impact of the awareness campaign on the exposure levels of the
   population.},

Title = {Interventions to Reduce Pesticide Exposure from the Agricultural Sector
   in Africa: A Workshop Report},
Journal = {INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {19},
Number = {15},
Month = {AUG},
Abstract = {Despite the fact that several cases of unsafe pesticide use among
   farmers in different parts of Africa have been documented, there is
   limited evidence regarding which specific interventions are effective in
   reducing pesticide exposure and associated risks to human health and
   ecology. The overall goal of the African Pesticide Intervention Project
   (APsent) study is to better understand ongoing research and public
   health activities related to interventions in Africa through the
   implementation of suitable target-specific situations or use contexts. A
   systematic review of the scientific literature on pesticide intervention
   studies with a focus on Africa was conducted. This was followed by a
   qualitative survey among stakeholders involved in pesticide research or
   management in the African region to learn about barriers to and
   promoters of successful interventions. The project was concluded with an
   international workshop in November 2021, where a broad range of topics
   relevant to occupational and environmental health risks were discussed
   such as acute poisoning, street pesticides, switching to alternatives,
   or disposal of empty pesticide containers. Key areas of improvement
   identified were training on pesticide usage techniques, research on the
   effectiveness of interventions targeted at exposure reduction and/or
   behavioral changes, awareness raising, implementation of adequate
   policies, and enforcement of regulations and processes.},

Abstract = {Dioxins are a kind of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) with
   extremely toxic. Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) process has
   become one of the most dominant discharge sources of dioxins. A
   comprehensive discussion about dioxin formation mechanisms was reviewed
   in this paper, and the mechanisms of high-temperature gas-phase reaction
   and ``de novo{''} synthesis were systematically illustrated in the form
   of diagrams. What's more, the effects of various influencing factors on
   the formation of PCDD/Fs were briefly analyzed in the form of a table.
   We believed that temperature, catalyst, chlorine source, carbon source,
   oxygen concentration and moisture were necessary factors for PCDD/Fs
   formation. Control technologies of dioxins in MSWI process were
   summarized subsequently from three stages: pre-combustion, in-combustion
   and post-combustion, and a device for synergistic removal of dioxins
   based on multi-field force coupling and technical routes for controlling
   dioxin emissions were proposed, so as to provide mechanisms and methods
   for effectively reducing the emission concentration of dioxins. An
   introduction was also conducted of dioxin control technologies in
   municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI-FA) in this paper, and
   their mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages and technical maturity were
   illustrated in the form of diagrams, which can provide theory and
   reference for in-depth research of follow-up scholars and industrial
   application of dioxin control technologies. Finally, current research
   hotspots, challenges and future research directions were proposed.
   Implications: In this paper, the main research contents and achievements
   are as follows: With the emphasis placed on the formation mechanism of
   dioxins and effects of various influencing factors on the formation of
   PCDD/Fs. The control technology of dioxins in MSWI process is summarized
   subsequently from three stages: pre-combustion, in-combustion and
   post-combustion.A device for synergistic removal of dioxins based on
   multi-field force coupling and technical routes for controlling dioxin
   emissions are proposed.A systematic review is conducted of the research
   progress on control technologies of dioxins in MSWI fly ash in the most
   recent years.The mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages and technical
   maturity of PCDD/Fs degradation technologies in MSWI fly ash are
   illustrated in the form of diagrams.Current research hotspots,
   challenges and future research directions are proposed.},

Title = {Shrimp-waste based dispersant as oil spill treating agent:
   Biodegradation of dispersant and dispersed oil},
Journal = {JOURNAL OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {439},
Month = {OCT 5},
Abstract = {The emerging demand for the enhancement of biodegradation of persistent
   organic pollutants from marine oil spills using oil-treating agents to
   minimize the environmental impacts promotes the development of green
   dis-persants. Shrimp waste is a potential raw material to generate green
   dispersants. The biodegradability of dispersed oil and dispersants
   themselves are key factors for the national consideration of the
   approval, stockpile, and usage of dispersants. However, it is unknown
   whether shrimp-waste-based dispersant (SWD) has high bioavailability or
   facilitates the biodegradation of dispersed oil. In this study, we
   tackled the biodegradation of oil dispersed by a purified SWD.
   Furthermore, the SWD biodegradability was evaluated by exploring the
   degradation genes via metagenomic sequencing, analyzing the enzymatic
   activities for dispersant biodegradation by molecular docking, and
   discussing the SWD toxicity. We discovered that the SWD facilitated the
   biodegra-dation of two crude oils (Alaska North Slope and Marine
   Fuel-No.6). The metagenomic analysis with molecular docking showed that
   fresh seawater had feasible enzymes to degrade the SWD to safety
   components. Addi-tionally, the SWD was low toxic and high bioactive. The
   findings helped confirm that the purified SWD is an effective and
   eco-sustainable marine oil spill treating agent and tracked the
   biodegradation of dispersed oil and the SWD.},

Title = {The estuarine plastics budget: A conceptual model and meta-analysis of
   microplastic abundance in estuarine systems},
Journal = {ESTUARINE COASTAL AND SHELF SCIENCE},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {275},
Month = {SEP 30},
Abstract = {Rivers and estuaries are a key transport pathway for microplastics to
   enter the world's oceans. Despite this, knowledge of the fate of plastic
   debris in estuaries is limited. Our study assesses the current state of
   knowledge on the distribution of microplastic debris in estuaries and
   their intertidal habitats. The literature is reviewed, and an estuarine
   plastics conceptual model is presented. The conceptual model is
   populated with data to show the globally averaged standing stocks of
   microplastic (< 5 mm) debris in estuarine waters and sediments.
   Estuarine plastic debris studies have previously focused on subtidal
   sediment and surface waters more than intertidal habitats. Estimated
   mean microplastic abundance is found to be greater (H = 53.136, P =
   0.000175) per volume of sediment than per volume of water, although
   there are large standard deviations within habitats and some caveats
   regarding variation in methods and limited data in published studies. We
   found that the most commonly recovered microplastics align with the most
   commonly used polymers, and that the rates of microplastic transfer
   between estuarine compartments remain poorly understood. This study
   informs global plastic transport models by demonstrating the ability of
   estuaries to trap large quantities of microplastic debris, but
   substantial differences in the methodologies between estuarine
   microplastic studies limit the value of global assessments of estuarine
   microplastics. The main recommendations from this study focus on
   improving data availability and stand-ardisation to better enable study
   comparisons and to improve our ability to examine global trends.},

Title = {Microbial Remediation: A Promising Tool for Reclamation of Contaminated
   Sites with Special Emphasis on Heavy Metal and Pesticide Pollution: A
   Review},
Journal = {PROCESSES},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {10},
Number = {7},
Month = {JUL},
Abstract = {Heavy metal and pesticide pollution have become an inevitable part of
   the modern industrialized environment that find their way into all
   ecosystems. Because of their persistent nature, recalcitrance, high
   toxicity and biological enrichment, metal and pesticide pollution has
   threatened the stability of the environment as well as the health of
   living beings. Due to the environmental persistence of heavy metals and
   pesticides, they get accumulated in the environs and consequently lead
   to food chain contamination. Therefore, remediation of heavy metals and
   pesticide contaminations needs to be addressed as a high priority.
   Various physico-chemical approaches have been employed for this purpose,
   but they have significant drawbacks such as high expenses, high labor,
   alteration in soil properties, disruption of native soil microflora and
   generation of toxic by-products. Researchers worldwide are focusing on
   bioremediation strategies to overcome this multifaceted problem, i.e.,
   the removal, immobilization and detoxification of pesticides and heavy
   metals, in the most efficient and cost-effective ways. For a period of
   millions of evolutionary years, microorganisms have become resistant to
   intoxicants and have developed the capability to remediate heavy metal
   ions and pesticides, and as a result, they have helped in the
   restoration of the natural state of degraded environs with long term
   environmental benefits. Keeping in view the environmental and health
   concerns imposed by heavy metals and pesticides in our society, we aimed
   to present a generalized picture of the bioremediation capacity of
   microorganisms. We explore the use of bacteria, fungi, algae and
   genetically engineered microbes for the remediation of both metals and
   pesticides. This review summarizes the major detoxification pathways and
   bioremediation technologies; in addition to that, a brief account is
   given of molecular approaches such as systemic biology, gene editing and
   omics that have enhanced the bioremediation process and widened its
   microbiological techniques toward the remediation of heavy metals and
   pesticides.},

Title = {Progress in preparation of plant biomass-derived biochar and application
   in pesticide residues field},
Journal = {CHINESE JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY},
Year = {2022},
Volume = {40},
Number = {6},
Pages = {499-508},

Abstract = {Pesticides such as insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides play an
   important role in the global agricultural industry as they reduce the
   occurrence of crop diseases, kill pests, and remove weeds. On the other
   hand, these pesticides are a double-edged sword because they have both
   acute effects and chronic adverse effects on human health. The
   widespread use of pesticides has led to their persistence in soil,
   water, and agricultural products, thus posing a serious threat to public
   health. Therefore, the removal and analysis of pesticides are critical
   to protecting human safety and health. When removing pesticides from the
   environment, it is imperative to ensure high removal efficiency while
   preventing secondary pollution to the environment. Because of the low
   concentrations of pesticide residue in the environment, complex matrix,
   and large throughput of pesticide residue analysis, a low-cost fast
   pre-treatment technique that has strong selectivity and an enrichment
   effect on the target pesticide residue, with little environmental
   impact, is required. Plant biomass-derived biochar is obtained from
   wheat straw, corn cob, rice husk, etc. This material has a large
   specific surface area, high pore capacity, tunable surface functional
   groups, and good environmental compatibility, which make it an
   inexpensive and efficient adsorbent. Hence, there is a need to
   systematically review the knowledge regarding the application of
   plant-based biochar on pesticide removal and pesticide residue analysis.
   This paper reviews the application progress of plant biomass-derived
   biochar in the above mentioned two areas over the last decade. The
   pesticide removal applications include reducing the mobility of
   pesticides in soil, eliminating the pollution caused by chiral
   pesticides, loading pesticide-degrading bacteria, and releasing
   fertilizers sustainably when removing pesticide. As mentioned above,
   plant biomass-derived biochar has a large specific surface area, a high
   number of functional groups on the surface, and good environmental
   compatibility. Therefore, it can effectively remove pesticides or their
   metabolites from the environment without causing any secondary
   pollution. During pre-treatment, plan biomass-derived biochar is used as
   an adsorbent for dispersive solid-phase extraction, solid-phase
   microextraction, and magnetic solid-phase extraction to selectively
   adsorb organophosphorus and triazole pesticides in fruits and
   vegetables, as well as organochlorine pesticides in the aquatic
   environment. This paper also introduces the adsorption mechanism of
   plant biomass-derived biochar, where studies based on computational
   simulations such as the density functional theory, molecular dynamics
   simulation, and giant canonical Monte Carlo simulation are carefully
   discussed. The benefits of adopting computational simulations are also
   mentioned. Finally, this paper summarizes the advantages and
   disadvantages of using plant biomass-derived biochar in pesticide
   removal and pre-treatment, as well as the future research trends in this
   area.},
