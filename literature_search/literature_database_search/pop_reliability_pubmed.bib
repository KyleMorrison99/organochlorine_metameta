  abstract={BACKGROUND: Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous substances that are found in our everyday lives, including pesticides, plasticizers, pharmaceutical agents, personal care products, and also in food products and food packaging. Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. OBJECTIVE: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. METHODS: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: "Endocrine disruptor(s)" OR "Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)" OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND "Breast cancer" to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. RESULTS: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. CONCLUSION: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence indicates that exposure to certain pollutants is associated with liver damage. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score =  6.20, p < 0.001), PFOS (z-score =  3.55, p < 0.001), and PFNA (z-score =  2.27, p = 0.023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10092.},

  abstract={We used a systematic review that included risk of bias and study sensitivity analysis to identify 34 studies examining changes in birth weight (BWT) in relation to PFNA biomarker measures (e.g., maternal serum/plasma or umbilical cord samples). We fit a random effects model of the overall pooled estimate and stratified estimates based on sample timing and overall study confidence. We conducted a meta-regression to further examine the impact of gestational age at biomarker sample timing. We detected a -32.9 g (95%CI: -47.0, -18.7) mean BWT deficit per each ln PFNA increase from 27 included studies. We did not detect evidence of publication bias (p(E) = 0.30) or between-study heterogeneity in the summary estimate (p(Q) = 0.05; I(2) = 36%). The twelve high confidence studies yielded a smaller pooled effect estimate (β = -28.0 g; 95%CI: -49.0, -6.9) than the ten medium (β = -39.0 g; 95%CI: -61.8, -16.3) or four low (β = -36.9 g; 95%CI: -82.9, 9.1) confidence studies. The stratum-specific results based on earlier pregnancy sampling periods in 11 studies showed smaller deficits (β = -22.0 g; 95%CI: -40.1, -4.0) compared to 10 mid- and late-pregnancy (β = -44.2 g; 95%CI: -64.8, -23.5) studies and six post-partum studies (β = -42.9 g; 95%CI: -88.0, 2.2). Using estimates of the specific gestational week of sampling, the meta-regression showed results consistent with the categorical sample analysis, in that as gestational age at sampling time increases across these studies, the summary effect estimate of a mean BWT deficit got larger. Overall, we detected mean BWT deficits for PFNA that were larger and more consistent across studies than previous PFAS meta-analyses. Compared to studies with later sampling, BWT deficits were smaller but remained sizeable for even the earliest sampling periods. Contrary to earlier meta-analyses for PFOA and PFOS, BWT deficits that were detected across all strata did not appear to be fully explained by potential bias due to pregnancy hemodynamics from sampling timing differences.},

  abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are used for their properties such as stain and water resistance. The substances have been associated with adverse health outcomes in both pregnant mothers and infants, including pre-eclampsia and low birthweight. A growing body of research suggests that PFAS are transferred from mother to fetus through the placenta, leading to in utero exposure. A systematic review was performed using the PubMed database to search for studies evaluating determinants of PFAS concentrations in blood matrices of pregnant mothers and neonates shortly after birth. Studies were included in this review if an observational study design was utilized, exposure to at least one PFAS analyte was measured, PFAS were measured in maternal or neonatal matrices, at least one determinant of PFAS concentrations was assessed, and results such as beta estimates were provided. We identified 35 studies for inclusion in the review and evaluated the PFAS and determinant relationships among the factors collected in these studies. Parity, breastfeeding history, maternal race and country of origin, and household income had the strongest and most consistent evidence to support their roles as determinants of certain PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers. Reported study findings on smoking status, alcohol consumption, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) suggest that these factors are not important determinants of PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers or neonates. Further study into informative factors such as consumer product use, detailed dietary information, and consumed water sources as potential determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is needed. Research on determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is critical to estimate past PFAS exposure, build improved exposure models, and further our understanding on dose-response relationships, which can influence epidemiological studies and risk assessment evaluations. Given the potential for adverse outcomes in pregnant mothers and neonates exposed to PFAS, it is important to identify and understand determinants of maternal and neonatal PFAS concentrations to better implement public health interventions in these populations.},

  abstract={Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and a leading cause of premature death. Epidemiological studies have found that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are associated with hypertension. However, the correlation between PFASs and hypertension has not been systematically reported. Based on evidence from population epidemiological surveys, we conducted a meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to assess the correlation between PFASs exposure and hypertension. In this study, three databases of PubMed, Web of science, Embase were searched and 13 literatures with 81,096 participants were included. Literature heterogeneity was evaluated by I(2) statistic, and the random effect model (I(2) > 50%) and fixed effect model (I(2) < 50%) were used to combine the studies in meta-analysis. The results showed that PFNA (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04-1.19), PFOA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02-1.23), PFOS (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.06-1.34) and PFHxS (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00-1.06) were significantly associated with hypertension, while other types of PFASs (∑PFAS, PFDA, PFUnDA) had no statistical significance. In addition, PFNA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03-1.22), PFOA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01-1.25) and PFOS (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00-1.25) exposure were positively correlated with the risk of hypertension in men, but not in women. Our study reveals that PFASs are risk factors for hypertension, with notable gender differences observed in PFASs-exposed populations. Specifically, males exposed to PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS exhibit a higher risk of hypertension compared to females. However, further investigations are needed to delve into the precise mechanism through which PFASs contribute to the development of hypertension.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: To investigate indications, surgical and functional outcomes of robotic or endoscopic facelift thyroid surgery (FTS) and whether FTS reported comparable outcomes of other surgical approaches. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. REVIEW METHODS: A literature search was conducted about indications, clinical and surgical outcomes of patients who underwent FTS using PICOTS and PRISMA Statements. Outcomes reviewed included age; gender; indications; pathology; functional evaluations; surgical outcomes and complications. RESULTS: Fifteen papers met our inclusion criteria, accounting for 394 patients. Endoscopic or robotic FTS was carried out for benign and malignant thyroid lesions, with or without central neck dissection. Nodule size and thyroid lobe volume did not exceed 6, 10 cm, respectively. FTS reported comparable outcome with transaxillary or oral approaches about operative time, complication rates or drainage features. The mean operative time ranged from 88 to 220 min, depending on the type of surgery (endoscopic vs robotic hemi- or total thyroidectomy). Conversion to open surgery was rare, occurring in 0-6.3% of cases. The most common complications were earlobe hypoesthesia, hematoma, seroma, transient hypocalcemia and transient recurrent nerve palsy. There was an important disparity between studies about the inclusion/exclusion criteria, surgical and functional outcomes. CONCLUSION: FTS is a safe and effective approach for thyroid benign and malignant lesions. FTS reports similar complications to conventional thyroidectomy and excellent cosmetic satisfaction.},

  abstract={The relation between pesticides exposure and metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been clearly identified. Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides exposure and their contaminants. We included 12 studies for a total of 6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1%) had a MetS. Overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk of MetS by 30% (95CI 22%-37%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of MetS by 23% (14-32%), as well as for most types of organochlorines: hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53% (28-78%), hexachlorobenzene by 40% (0.01-80%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene by 22% (9-34%), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28% (5-50%), oxychlordane by 24% (1-47%), and transnonchlor by 35% (19-52%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk by 46% (35-56%) using crude data or by 19% (10-29%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for overall pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36% risk increase, 17-55%) and transnonchlor (25% risk increase, 3-48%) with fully-adjusted models. Metaregressions demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk of MetS in comparison to most other pesticides. The risk increased for more recent periods (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by year). We demonstrated an inverse relationship with body mass index and male gender. In conclusion, pesticides exposure is a major risk factor for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data are lacking for other types of pesticides. The risk increased with time, reflecting a probable increase of the use of pesticides worldwide. The inverse relationship with body mass index may signify a stockage of pesticides and contaminants in fat tissue.},

  abstract={PURPOSE: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce acid secretion in the stomach and rank as one of the most widely used acid-suppressing medicines globally. While PPIs are safe in the short-term, emerging evidence shows risks associated with long-term use. Current evidence on global PPI use is scarce. This systematic review aims to evaluate global PPI use in the general population. METHODS: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were systematically searched from inception to 31 March 2023 to identify observational studies on oral PPI use among individuals aged ≥ 18 years. PPI use was classified by demographics and medication factors (dose, duration, and PPI types). The absolute numbers of PPI users for each subcategory were summed and expressed as a percentage. RESULTS: The search identified data from 28 million PPI users in 23 countries from 65 articles. This review indicated that nearly one-quarter of adults use a PPI. Of those using PPIs, 63% were less than 65 years. 56% of PPI users were female, and "White" ethnicities accounted for 75% of users. Nearly two-thirds of users were on high doses (≥ defined daily dose (DDD)), 25% of users continued PPIs for > 1 year, and 28% of these continued for > 3 years. CONCLUSION: Given the widespread use PPIs and increasing concern regarding long-term use, this review provides a catalyst to support more rational use, particularly with unnecessary prolonged continuation. Clinicians should review PPI prescriptions regularly and deprescribe when there is no appropriate ongoing indication or evidence of benefit to reduce health harm and treatment cost.},

  abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: There is a growing interest in understanding the health effects of exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) through the study of the human metabolome. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify consistent findings between PFAS and metabolomic signatures. We conducted a search matching specific keywords that was independently reviewed by two authors on two databases (EMBASE and PubMed) from their inception through July 19, 2022 following PRISMA guidelines. RECENT FINDINGS: We identified a total of 28 eligible observational studies that evaluated the associations between 31 different PFAS exposures and metabolomics in humans. The most common exposure evaluated was legacy long-chain PFAS. Population sample sizes ranged from 40 to 1,105 participants at different stages across the lifespan. A total of 19 studies used a non-targeted metabolomics approach, 7 used targeted approaches, and 2 included both. The majority of studies were cross-sectional (n = 25), including four with prospective analyses of PFAS measured prior to metabolomics. SUMMARY: Most frequently reported associations across studies were observed between PFAS and amino acids, fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, phosphosphingolipids, bile acids, ceramides, purines, and acylcarnitines. Corresponding metabolic pathways were also altered, including lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, nucleotide, energy metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. We found consistent evidence across studies indicating PFAS-induced alterations in lipid and amino acid metabolites, which may be involved in energy and cell membrane disruption.},

  abstract={Human ingestion of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated food and water is linked to the development of several cancers, birth defects and other illnesses. The complete mineralisation of aqueous PFAS by ultrasound (sonolysis) into harmless inorganics has been demonstrated in many studies. However, the range and interconnected nature of reaction parameters (frequency, power, temperature etc.), and variety of reaction metrics used, limits understanding of degradation mechanisms and parametric trends. This work summarises the state-of-the-art for PFAS sonolysis, considering reaction mechanisms, kinetics, intermediates, products, rate limiting steps, reactant and product measurement techniques, and effects of co-contaminants. The meta-analysis showed that mid-high frequency (100 - 1,000 kHz) sonolysis mechanisms are similar, regardless of reaction conditions, while the low frequency (20 - 100 kHz) mechanisms are specific to oxidative species added, less well understood, and generally slower than mid-high frequency mechanisms. Arguments suggest that PFAS degradation occurs via adsorption (not absorption) at the bubble interface, followed by headgroup cleavage. Further mechanistic steps toward mineralisation remain to be proven. For the first time, complete stoichiometric reaction equations are derived for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) sonolysis, which add H(2) as a reaction product and consider CO an intermediate. Fluorinated intermediate products are derived for common, and more novel PFAS, and a naming system proposed for novel perfluoroether carboxylates. The meta-analysis also revealed the transition between pseudo first and zero order PFOA/S kinetics commonly occurs at 15 - 40 µM. Optimum values of; ultrasonic frequency (300 - 500 kHz), concentration (>15 - 40 μM), temperature (≈20 °C), and pH range (3.2 - 4) for rapid PFOX degradation are derived by evaluation of prior works, while optimum values for the dilution factor applied to PFAS containing firefighting foams and applied power require further work. Rate limiting steps are debated and F(-) is shown to be rate enhancing, while SO(4)(2-) and CO(2) by products are theorised to be rate limiting. Sonolysis was compared to other PFAS destructive technologies and shown to be the only treatment which fully mineralises PFAS, degrades different PFAS in order of decreasing hydrophobicity, is parametrically well studied, and has low-moderate energy requirements (several kWh g(-1) PFAS). It is concluded that sonolysis of PFAS in environmental samples would be well incorporated within a treatment train for improved efficiency.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Treatment failure is considered to be an important factor in relation to the increase in scabies incidence over the last decade. However, the regional and temporal differences, in addition to the predictors of therapy failure, are unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the prevalence of treatment failure in patients with scabies and investigation of associated factors. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 2021 for randomized and quasi-randomized trials, in addition to observational studies that enrolled children or adults diagnosed with confirmed or clinical scabies treated with permethrin, ivermectin, crotamiton, benzyl benzoate, malathion, sulfur or lindane, and measured treatment failure or factors associated with treatment failure. We performed a random effects meta-analysis for all outcomes reported by at least two studies. RESULTS: A total of 147 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. The overall prevalence of treatment failure was 15.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-17.6; I2 = 95.3%, moderate-certainty evidence] with regional differences between World Health Organization regions (P = 0.003) being highest in the Western Pacific region (26.9%, 95% CI 14.5-41.2). Oral ivermectin (11.8%, 95% CI 8.4-15.4), topical ivermectin (9.3%, 95% CI 5.1-14.3) and permethrin (10.8%, 95% CI 7.5-14.5) had relatively lower failure prevalence compared with the overall prevalence. Failure prevalence was lower in patients treated with two doses of oral ivermectin (7.1%, 95% CI 3.1-12.3) compared with those treated with one dose (15.2%, 95% CI 10.8-20.2; P = 0.021). Overall and permethrin treatment failure prevalence in the included studies (1983-2021) increased by 0.27% and 0.58% per year, respectively. Only three studies conducted a multivariable risk factor analysis; no studies assessed resistance. CONCLUSIONS: A second dose of ivermectin showed lower failure prevalence than single-dose ivermectin, which should be considered in all guidelines. The increase in treatment failure over time hints at decreasing mite susceptibility for several drugs, but reasons for failure are rarely assessed. Ideally, scabicide susceptibility testing should be implemented in future studies.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Associations between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and blood lipid levels in humans were mixed. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize associations between PFAS and blood lipids in adults. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed and Web of Science for articles published through 13 May 2022 that examined associations between PFAS and blood lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triacylglycerols (TGs). Inclusion criteria included the presence of associations between five PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFDA, and PFNA) and four blood lipid measures (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TGs) in adults. Data on study characteristics and PFAS-lipid associations were extracted. Assessments of individual study quality were performed. Associations of changes of blood lipid levels corresponding to 1 interquartile range (IQR)-unit increase of blood PFAS levels were pooled using random effects models. Dose-response relationships were examined. RESULTS: Twenty-nine publications were included in the present analyses. Every IQR increase of PFOA was significantly associated with a 2.1-mg/dL increase in TC (95% CI: 1.2, 3.0), a 1.3-mg/dL increase in TGs (95% CI: 0.1, 2.4), and a 1.4-mg/dL increase in LDL-C (95% CI: 0.6, 2.2). PFOS was also significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels, and the corresponding values were 2.6 (95% CI: 1.5, 3.6) and 1.9 (95% CI: 0.9, 3.0), respectively. Associations of PFOS and PFOA with HDL-C levels were largely null. For minor PFAS species, PFHxS was significantly associated with higher levels of HDL-C [0.8 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.2)]. Inverse associations were observed between PFDA and TGs [ - 5.0 (95% CI: - 8.1, - 1.9)] and between PFNA and TGs [ - 1.7 (95% CI: - 3.5, - 0.02)], whereas a positive association was observed between PFDA and HDL-C [1.4 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.7)]. Nonsignificant nonlinear dose-response relationships were identified for associations of PFOA and PFOS with certain blood lipids. DISCUSSION: PFOA and PFOS were significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels in adults. Whether these findings may translate into an elevated cardiovascular disease risk associated with PFAS exposure warrants further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11840.},

  abstract={Milk formation in the breast during breastfeeding is a complex hormonally regulated process, potentially sensitive to the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemical exposures. The environmental chemicals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are known endocrine disruptors. PFAS exposure have been associated with insufficient mammary gland development in mice and reduced breastfeeding duration in humans. The aim of this review was to gather the epidemiological evidence on the association between PFAS exposure and breastfeeding duration. Using PubMed and Embase, we performed a systematic literature search (on 23 January 2023) to identify epidemiological studies examining the association between maternal PFAS exposure and breastfeeding duration. Animal studies, reviews, and non-English studies were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of exposures tool. Estimates describing the association between PFAS exposure and the duration of breastfeeding were identified, and the data were synthesized separately for each type of PFAS and for the duration of exclusive and total breastfeeding. Six studies with between 336 and 2374 participants each were identified. PFAS exposure was assessed in serum samples (five studies) or based on residential address (one study). Five out of six studies found shorter total duration of breastfeeding with higher PFAS exposure. The most consistent associations were seen for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). The finding of a potential causal association between PFAS exposure and breastfeeding duration is in agreement with findings from experimental studies.},

  abstract={INTRODUCTION: Evidence of the adverse metabolic health effects of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is increasing. However, the impact of PFAS on cardiovascular diseases remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the impact of PFAS on the stroke risk. CONTENT: Databases were searched for studies published up to November 1, 2022, which report the association between stroke and exposure to at least one of four main PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS], perfluorononanoic acid [PFNA], and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid [PFHxS]). Data extraction and quality assessment were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: Four studies were included in this systematic review. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident stroke per 1-log unit increment in each serum PFAS were combined in the meta-analysis. The risk of development of stroke was not significantly associated with PFOA, PFOS, or PFNA exposure (PFOA: pooled odds ratio [OR]=1.001, 95 % confidence interval [CI]=0.975-1.028, p=0.934; PFOS: pooled OR=0.994, 95 % CI=0.972-1.017, p=0.601; PFNA: pooled OR=1.016, 95 % CI=0.920-1.123, p=0.752), whereas a moderately lower risk was associated with PFHxS exposure without statistical significance (pooled OR=0.953, 95 % CI=0.908-1.001, p=0.054). PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA exposure showed a neutral association, while PFHxS showed a possible inverse association with the risk of stroke. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution. Further prospective observational studies with PFAS mixture analyses are warranted.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: The reproductive toxicity of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been verified in both animal and in vitro experiments, however, the association between PFAS and female fertility remains contradictory in population studies. Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of PFAS on female fertility based on population evidence. METHODS: Electronic searches of the Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were conducted (from inception to March 2022) to collect observational studies related to PFAS and female fertility. Two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted information and evaluated the risk of bias for the included studies, meta-analysis was performed using R software. RESULTS: A total of 5468 records were searched and 13 articles fully met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was negatively associated with the female fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (Cl) [0.78; 0.98]) and positively associated with the odds ratio for infertility (OR = 1.33, 95%Cl [1.03; 1.73]). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure was negatively associated with the fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.94, 95% CI [0.90; 0.98]). Pooled effect values for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) exposure did not find sufficient evidence for an association with female fertility. CONCLUSION: Based on the evidence provided by the current study, increased levels of PFAS exposure are associated with reduced fertility in women, this was characterized by a reduction in fecundability odds ratio and an increase in odds ratio for infertility. This finding could partially explain the decline in female fertility and provide insight into risk assessment when manufacturing products containing PFAS.},

  abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of man-made chemicals that are persistent in the environment. They can be transferred across the placenta to fetuses and through human milk to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that the benefits of breastfeeding infants almost always outweigh the potential risks of harm from environmental chemicals. However, there are few chemical-specific summaries of the potential harms of exposure to PFAS during the neonatal period through breastfeeding. This systematic review explores whether exposure to PFAS through breastfeeding is associated with adverse health outcomes among infants and children using evidence from human and animal studies. Systematic searches identified 4297 unique records from 7 databases. The review included 37 total articles, including 9 animal studies and 1 human study measuring the direct contribution of exposure of the infant or pup through milk for any health outcome. Animal studies provided evidence of associations between exposure to PFOA through breastfeeding and reduced early life body weight gain, mammary gland development, and thyroid hormone levels. They also provided limited evidence of associations between PFOS exposure through breastfeeding with reduced early life body weight gain and cellular changes in the hippocampus. The direct relevance of any of these outcomes to human health is uncertain, and it is possible that many adverse health effects of exposure through breastfeeding have not yet been studied. This review documents the current state of science and highlights the need for future research to guide clinicians making recommendations on infant feeding.},

  abstract={Except for known sociodemographic factors, long-term exposure to environmental pollutants has been shown to contribute to the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but the conclusions remain controversial. To provide a comprehensive overview of the association between environmental pollutants and GDM, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Several electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline and Cochrane) were searched for related epidemiological and experimental studies up to September 2022. For epidemiological studies, a meta-analysis was carried out to appraise the effect of environmental pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), phenols, phthalates (PAEs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and parabens exposure on GDM. Moreover, we also summarized possible biological mechanisms linking pollution exposure and GDM based on the included experimental studies. A total of 80 articles were enrolled, including 38 epidemiological studies and 42 experimental studies. Meta-analysis results showed that exposure to PAEs [OR (95%CI) = 1.07 (1.00, 1.14)], PFASs [OR (95%CI) = 1.10 (1.01, 1.19)], as well as PCBs [OR (95%CI) = 1.18 (1.02, 1.36)] and PBDEs [OR (95%CI) = 1.33 (1.17, 1.50)] significantly increased the risk of GDM, but no significant effects were found for phenols, OCPs, and parabens. In addition, experimental studies suggested that the potential biological mechanisms of environmental pollutants contributing to GDM may involve insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, neurohormonal dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetic modification, and alterations in gut microbiome. In conclusion, long-term environmental pollutants exposure may induce the development of GDM, and there may be a synergistic effect between the homologs. However, studies conducted on the direct biological link between environmental pollutants and GDM were few. More prospective studies and high-quality in vivo and in vitro experiments were needed to investigate the specific effects and mechanisms.},

  abstract={AIMS: Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during critical neurodevelopmental windows has been associated with the risk of autistic traits. This systematic review of epidemiological studies examined the association between maternal exposure to EDCs during pregnancy and the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the offspring. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception to November 17, 2022, for studies investigating the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and outcomes related to ASD. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023389386). RESULTS: We included 27 observational studies assessing prenatal exposure to phthalates (8 studies), polychlorinated biphenyls (8 studies), organophosphate pesticides (8 studies), phenols (7 studies), perfluoroalkyl substances (6 studies), organochlorine pesticides (5 studies), brominated flame retardants (3 studies), dioxins (1 study), and parabens (1 study). The number of examined children ranged from 77 to 1,556, the age at the assessment of autistic traits ranged from 3 to 14 years, and most studies assessed autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale. All but one study was considered to have a low risk of bias. Overall, there was no association between maternal exposure to specific ECDs during pregnancy and the occurrence of autistic traits in offspring. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from the epidemiological studies evaluated here do not support an association between prenatal exposure to ECDs and the likelihood of autistic traits in later in life. These findings should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of the absence of neurodevelopment effects of EDCs affecting ASD risk, given the limitations of current studies such as representative exposure assessment, small sample sizes, inadequacy to assess sexually dimorphic effects, or the effects of EDC mixtures. Future studies should carefully address these limitations.},

  abstract={In vivo, in vitro, and epidemiological evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may alter thyroid function in human health, with negative effects on maternal and fetal development outcomes. However, data on the effects of PFAS on thyroid hormones remain controversial. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 13 eligible studies searched from Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science by July 10, 2022, to explore the relationship between maternal exposure to PFAS and thyroid health effects, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (TT3), thyroxin (TT4), free T3 (FT3), and free T4 (FT4). The estimated values (β) and the corresponding confidence intervals (95%CI) were extracted for analysis. The tests for heterogeneity, sensitivity and publication bias between studies were performed using Stata 15.0. The combined results showed a positive association between changes in TSH and exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), with no significant correlation observed between changes in other thyroid hormones and exposure to PFAS. This difference was attributed to sample size, region, sample type, body mass index (BMI), and gestational week. Our data recommend verifying the relationship between PFAS exposure and thyroid health effects in a large sample population cohort in future studies. In addition, health care should be taken into account in early and mid-pregnancy.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants and suspected endocrine disruptors. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to summarise the associations between prenatal or childhood exposure to PFASs and childhood overweight/obesity. METHODS: The search was performed on the bibliographic databases PubMed and Embase with text strings containing terms related to prenatal, breastfeeding, childhood, overweight, obesity, and PFASs. Only papers describing a biomonitoring study in pregnant women or in children up to 18 years that assessed body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), or fat mass in children were included. When the estimates of the association between a PFAS and an outcome were reported from at least 3 studies, a meta-analysis was conducted; moreover, to correctly compare the studies, we developed a method to convert the different effect estimates and made them comparable each other. Meta-analyses were performed also stratifying by sex and age, and sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: In total, 484 and 779 articles were retrieved from PubMed and Embase, respectively, resulting in a total of 826 articles after merging duplicates. The papers included in this systematic review were 49: 26 evaluating prenatal exposure to PFASs, 17 childhood exposure, and 6 both. Considering a qualitative evaluation, results were conflicting, with positive, negative, and null associations. 30 papers were included in meta-analyses (19 prenatal, 7 children, and 4 both). Positive associations were evidenced between prenatal PFNA and BMI, between PFOA and BMI in children who were more than 3 years, and between prenatal PFNA and WC. Negative associations were found between prenatal PFOS and BMI in children who were 3 or less years, and between PFHxS and risk of overweight. Relatively more consistent negative associations were evidenced between childhood exposure to three PFASs (PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA) and BMI, in particular PFOS in boys. However, heterogeneity among studies was high. CONCLUSION: Even though heterogeneous across studies, the pooled evidence suggests possible associations, mostly positive, between prenatal exposure to some PFASs and childhood BMI/WC; and relatively stronger evidence for negative associations between childhood exposure to PFASs and childhood BMI.},

  abstract={Depersonalization-Derealization disorder (DDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by persistent feelings of detachment from one's self and of unreality about the outside world. This review aims to examine the prevalence of DDD amongst different populations. A systematic review protocol was developed before literature searching. Original articles were drawn from three electronic databases and included only studies where prevalence rates of DDD were assessed by standardized diagnostic tools. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Twenty-three papers were identified and categorized into three groups of participants: general population, mixed in/outpatient samples, and patients with specific disorders. The prevalence rates ranged from 0% to 1.9% amongst the general population, 5-20% in outpatients and 17.5-41.9% in inpatients. In studies of patients with specific disorders, prevalence rates varied: 1.8-5.9% (substance abuse), 3.3-20.2% (anxiety), 3.7-20.4% (other dissociative disorders), 16.3% (schizophrenia), 17% (borderline personality disorder), ~50% (depression). The highest rates were found in people who experienced interpersonal abuse (25-53.8%). The prevalence rate of DDD is around 1% in the general population, consistent with previous findings. DDD is more prevalent amongst adolescents and young adults as well as in patients with mental disorders. There is also a possible relationship between interpersonal abuse and DDD, which merits further research.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the etiology of diabetes. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS with mortality and morbidity of diabetes and to quantitatively evaluate the summary effect estimates of the existing literature. METHODS: We searched three electronic databases for epidemiological studies concerning PFAS and diabetes published before April 1, 2022. Summary odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), or β and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were respectively calculated to evaluate the association between PFAS and diabetes using random-effects model by the exposure type, and dose-response meta-analyses were also performed when possible. We also assessed the risk of bias of the studies included and the confidence in the body of evidence. RESULTS: An initial literature search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 studies were eventually included. The meta-analyses indicated that the observed statistically significant PFAS-T2DM associations were consistent in cohort studies, while the associations were almost non-significant in case-control and cross-sectional studies. Dose-response meta-analysis showed a "parabolic-shaped" association between perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) exposure and T2DM risk. Available evidence was rated with "low" risk of bias, and the level of evidence for PFAS and incident T2DM was considered "moderate". CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure may increase the risk of incident T2DM, and that PFOA may exert non-monotonic dose-response effect on T2DM risk. Considering the widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects of PFAS, further cohort studies with improvements in expanding the sample size, adjusting the covariates, and considering different types of PFAS exposure at various doses, are needed to elucidate the putative causal associations and potential mode of action of different PFAS on diabetes. IMPACT STATEMENT: A growing body of evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the development of diabetes. However, epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS and diabetes is inconsistent. We performed this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to PFAS may increase diabetes risk among the general population. Reduced exposure to these "forever and everywhere chemicals" may be an important preventative approach to reducing the risk of diabetes across the population.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of synthetic (man-made) chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial processes. Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of  ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA's Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement-only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with  ≥ 21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the  ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10343.},

However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil- and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs.},

  abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of structurally diverse synthetic organic chemicals that are chemically stable, resistant to degradation, and persistent in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Widespread use of PFAS in industrial processing and manufacturing over the last 70 years has led to global contamination of built and natural environments. The brain is a lipid rich and highly vascularized organ composed of long-lived neurons and glial cells that are especially vulnerable to the impacts of persistent and lipophilic toxicants. Generally, PFAS partition to protein-rich tissues of the body, primarily the liver and blood, but are also detected in the brains of humans, wildlife, and laboratory animals. Here we review factors impacting the absorption, distribution, and accumulation of PFAS in the brain, and currently available evidence for neurotoxic impacts defined by disruption of neurochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioral endpoints. Emphasis is placed on the neurotoxic potential of exposures during critical periods of development and in sensitive populations, and factors that may exacerbate neurotoxicity of PFAS. While limitations and inconsistencies across studies exist, the available body of evidence suggests that the neurobehavioral impacts of long-chain PFAS exposures during development are more pronounced than impacts resulting from exposure during adulthood. There is a paucity of experimental studies evaluating neurobehavioral and molecular mechanisms of short-chain PFAS, and even greater data gaps in the analysis of neurotoxicity for PFAS outside of the perfluoroalkyl acids. Whereas most experimental studies were focused on acute and subchronic impacts resulting from high dose exposures to a single PFAS congener, more realistic exposures for humans and wildlife are mixtures exposures that are relatively chronic and low dose in nature. Our evaluation of the available human epidemiological, experimental, and wildlife data also indicates heightened accumulation of perfluoroalkyl acids in the brain after environmental exposure, in comparison to the experimental studies. These findings highlight the need for additional experimental analysis of neurodevelopmental impacts of environmentally relevant concentrations and complex mixtures of PFAS.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), pesticides are widely used in agricultural and residential settings. Little is known about how pesticides affect child growth. OBJECTIVES: To systematically review and synthesise the evidence on the associations between pesticide exposure and adverse birth outcomes and/or impaired postnatal growth in children up to 5 years of age in LMICs. METHODS: We searched 10 databases from inception through November 2021. We included cohort and cross-sectional studies investigating associations between self-reported or measured prenatal or postnatal pesticide exposure and child growth (postnatal child linear/ponderal growth, and/or birth outcomes). Two researchers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed certainty using GRADE. The protocol was preregistered with PROSPERO (CRD42021292919). RESULTS: Of 939 records retrieved, 31 studies met inclusion criteria (11 cohort, 20 cross-sectional). All studies assessed prenatal exposure. Twenty-four studies reported on birth weight. Four found positive associations with organochlorines (0.01-0.25 standardised mean difference (SMD)) and two found negative associations (-0.009 SMD to -55 g). Negative associations with organophosphates (-170 g, n = 1) and pyrethroids (-97 to -233 g, n = 2) were also documented. Two (out of 15) studies reporting on birth length found positive associations with organochlorines (0.21-0.25 SMD) and one found negative associations (-0.25 to -0.32 SMD). Organophosphate exposure was negatively associated with birth length (-0.37 cm, n = 1). Organophosphate exposure was also associated with higher risk/prevalence of low birth weight (2 out of nine studies) and preterm birth (2 out of six studies). Certainty of the evidence was "very low" for all outcomes. CONCLUSION: The limited literature from LMICs shows inconclusive associations between prenatal pesticide exposure, child growth, and birth outcomes. Studies with accurate quantitative data on exposure to commonly used pesticides in LMICs using consistent methodologies in comparable populations are needed to better understand how pesticides influence child growth.},

  abstract={Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE), cause significant morbidity and mortality among pregnant women. Several environmental toxins, particularly those that affect the normal function of the placenta and the endothelium, are emerging as potential risk factors for HDP. Among them, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), widely used in a variety of commercial products, have been related to a variety of adverse health effects including HDP. This study was conducted by searching three databases for observational studies reporting associations between PFAS and HDP, all of which were published before December 2022. We used random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled risk estimates, and assessing each combination of exposure and outcome for quality and level of evidence. In total, 15 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The results from meta-analyses showed that risk of PE was increased with exposure to PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.85; N = 6 studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty), PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) (RR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.23, 1.86; N = 6 studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; moderate certainty), and PFHxS (perfluorohexane sulfonate) (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.76; N = 6 studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty). PFOS was also associated with an increased risk of HDP (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.76; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty). Exposure to legacy PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS) is associated with an increased risk of PE, and PFOS is further associated with HDP. In view of the limitations of meta-analysis and quality of evidence, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Further research is required that assesses exposure to multiple PFAS in diverse and well-powered cohorts.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used synthetic aliphatic compounds. This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations. METHOD: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (≥18 years old) and children. Primary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between concentrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were performed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool. RESULTS: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associations between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations. CONCLUSION: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human populations. Future research should be conducted on the less well-studied PFAS to explore their effects on human health and in regions where such studies are currently lacking. (300 words).},

  abstract={AIMS: Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently coexist and show a bidirectional relationship. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to decipher the precise relationship between SSS and AF, further exploring and comparing different therapy strategies on the occurrence or progression of AF in patients with SSS. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic literature search was conducted until November 2022. A total of 35 articles with 37,550 patients were included. Patients with SSS were associated with new-onset AF compared to those without SSS. Catheter ablation was associated with a lower risk of AF recurrence, AF progression, all-cause mortality, stroke and hospitalization of heart failure compared to pacemaker therapy. Regarding the different pacing strategies for SSS, VVI/VVIR has higher risk of new-onset AF than DDD/DDDR. No significant difference was found between AAI/AAIR and DDD/DDDR, as well as between DDD/DDDR and minimal ventricular pacing (MVP) for AF recurrence. AAI/AAIR was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality when compared to DDD/DDDR, but lower risk of cardiac death when compared to DDD/DDDR. Right atrial septum pacing was associated with a similar risk of new-onset AF or AF recurrence compared to right atrial appendage pacing. CONCLUSION: SSS is associated with a higher risk of AF. For patients with both SSS and AF, catheter ablation should be considered. This meta-analysis re-emphasizes that high percentage of ventricular pacing should be avoided in patients with SSS in order to decrease AF burden and mortality.},

  abstract={Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals has been linked to gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE). However, the results were conflicting and inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for an overview of these relationships. We searched PubMed, and Google Scholar for studies investigating bisphenol A, phthalates, and per or poly-fluoroalkyl substances and GH or PE. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for risk estimate using the generic inverse variance method. A total of 14 studies were included in the present analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, OR:1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.39), perfluoro octane sulfonic acid (PFOS, (OR:1.23, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.38), and perfluononanoic acid (PFNA, OR:1.20, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.40) were significantly associated with an increased risk of PE. There was no significant association observed with perfluoro hexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluoro decanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoro heptanoic acid (PFHpA), and perfluoro undecanoic acid (PFUnDA) and PE. For GH, a statistically significant positive association was found with PFOA (OR:1.18, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.39) and PFHxS (OR:1.15, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.29). Among various phthalates analysed only mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP, OR:1.37, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.70) showed an association with GH. From our analysis, bisphenol A exposure during pregnancy did not show a significant association with the risk of PE. Our findings indicated that exposure to PFASs such as PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of PE and PFOA and PFHxS with GH. We also found that MEP was associated with GH. Most of the results were unstable in sensitivity analysis. Since most of these associations have limited evidence, more research is needed to confirm these findings.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Maternal pesticide exposure might be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes through triggering inflammation and oxidative stress and disrupting endocrine functions. Yet the association between prenatal pesticide exposure and risk of preterm birth remains inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of human observational studies using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) framework to explore the association of per ten-fold increase of pesticide concentrations in maternal biological samples during pregnancy with risk of preterm birth and length of gestational age at birth. DATA SOURCE: Five English (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus) and 3 Chinese databases (China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)) were searched till Jan 18th, 2023. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: To be included, pesticide exposure should be measured in maternal biological samples during pregnancy and in log-transformed forms. The primary outcome was preterm birth and the secondary outcome was gestational age at birth. STUDY APPRAISAL, SYNTHESIS METHODS AND CONFIDENCE ASSESSMENT: Quality of studies was evaluated using OHAT Risk of Bias Tool. Evidence was quantitatively synthesized with Correlated and Hierarchical Effects (CHE) model. The confidence rating in the body of evidence was done using OHAT. RESULTS: A total of 21 studies reported by 18 papers were included, with 7 studies for preterm birth and 19 for gestational age at birth. The meta-analysis found a ten-fold increase of pesticide concentrations was potentially associated with risk of preterm birth (pooled OR = 1.28; 95%CI: 0.93, 1.78) and shortened gestational age at birth (β = -0.10; 95%CI: -0.21, 0.01). Sampling biospecimens in different trimesters was identified as a potential modifier in the association between pesticide exposure and length of gestational age (F = 2.77, P < 0.05). For studies that collected samples at any time during pregnancy, pesticide exposure was found to be associated with shortened length of gestational age (β = -0.43; 95%CI: -0.81, -0.06). The confidence rating in the body of evidence was "moderate" and "very low" for preterm birth and gestational age at birth, respectively. CONCLUSION: Our result suggested moderate evidence of an association between pesticide exposure and higher risk of preterm birth. Yet more studies are still needed with larger sample size and careful considerations of confounders and accuracy of outcome measurements. Attention is also required on other pesticide compounds in addition to organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides, and on windows of susceptibility.},

However, current epidemiological studies on the association between prenatal PFAS exposure and neurobehavioral problems among offspring, especially attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to study the relationship between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and ADHD and ASD in offspring based on meta-analyses. Online databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, were searched comprehensively for eligible studies conducted before July 2021. Eleven studies (up to 8493 participants) were included in this analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that exposure to perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was positively associated with ADHD in the highest quartile group. Negative associations were observed between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and ADHD/ASD, including between perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and ASD. There were no associations found between total PFAS concentration groups and neurobehavioral problems. The trial sequential analyses showed unstable results. Our findings indicated that PFOA and PFOS exposure during pregnancy might be associated with ADHD in offspring and that prenatal PFOS and PFNA exposure might be associated with ASD in offspring. According to the limited evidence obtained for most associations, additional studies are required to validate these findings.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), poly-brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates (PAEs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). METHODS: Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case-control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I(2) statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests. RESULTS: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00--1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15-1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03-1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02-1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91-1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00-1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02-1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00-1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis. CONCLUSION: These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.},

  abstract={Low back pain is an extremely common condition with severe consequences. Among its potential specific causes, degenerative disc disease (DDD) is one of the most frequently observed. Mechanobiology is an emerging science studying the interplay between mechanical stimuli and the biological behavior of cells and tissues. The aim of the presented study is to review, with a systematic approach, the existing literature regarding the mechanobiology of the human intervertebral disc (IVD), define the main pathways involved in DDD and identify novel potential therapeutic targets. The review was carried out in accordance with the Preferential Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were included if they described biological responses of human IVD cells under mechanical stimulation or alterations of mechanical properties of the IVD determined by different gene expression. Fifteen studies were included and showed promising results confirming the mechanobiology of the human IVD as a key element in DDD. The technical advances of the last decade have allowed us to increase our understanding of this topic, enabling us to identify possible therapeutic targets to treat and to prevent DDD. Further research and technological innovations will shed light on the interactions between the mechanics and biology of the human IVD.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is ubiquitous and has been associated with an increased risk of several cardiometabolic diseases. However, the metabolic pathways linking PFAS exposure and human disease are unclear. OBJECTIVE: We examined associations of PFAS mixtures with alterations in metabolic pathways in independent cohorts of adolescents and young adults. METHODS: Three hundred twelve overweight/obese adolescents from the Study of Latino Adolescents at Risk (SOLAR) and 137 young adults from the Southern California Children's Health Study (CHS) were included in the analysis. Plasma PFAS and the metabolome were determined using liquid-chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. A metabolome-wide association study was performed on log-transformed metabolites using Bayesian regression with a g-prior specification and g-computation for modeling exposure mixtures to estimate the impact of exposure to a mixture of six ubiquitous PFAS (PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA). Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Mummichog and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Significance across cohorts was determined using weighted Z-tests. RESULTS: In the SOLAR and CHS cohorts, PFAS exposure was associated with alterations in tyrosine metabolism (meta-analysis p = 0.00002) and de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (p = 0.03), among others. For example, when increasing all PFAS in the mixture from low ( ∼ 30th percentile) to high ( ∼ 70th percentile), thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone related to tyrosine metabolism, increased by 0.72 standard deviations (SDs; equivalent to a standardized mean difference) in the SOLAR cohort (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 0.00, 1.20) and 1.60 SD in the CHS cohort (95% BCI: 0.39, 2.80). Similarly, when going from low to high PFAS exposure, arachidonic acid increased by 0.81 SD in the SOLAR cohort (95% BCI: 0.37, 1.30) and 0.67 SD in the CHS cohort (95% BCI: 0.00, 1.50). In general, no individual PFAS appeared to drive the observed associations. DISCUSSION: Exposure to PFAS is associated with alterations in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in adolescents and young adults. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11372.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Epidemiologic studies of serum per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and antibody response to vaccines have suggested an adverse association, but the consistency and magnitude of this association remain unclear. OBJECTIVE: The goal of this systematic review was to determine the size of the association between a doubling in perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) serum concentration and difference in log(e) antibody concentration following a vaccine, with a focus on five PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). DATA SOURCE: We conducted online searches of PubMed and Web of Science through May 17, 2022 and identified 14 eligible reports published from 2012 to 2022. STUDY ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA, PARTICIPANTS, AND INTERVENTIONS: We included studies conducted in humans, including mother-child pairs, which examined serum PFAS concentration in relation to serum concentration of antibody to a specific antigen following a vaccine. STUDY APPRAISAL AND SYNTHESIS METHODS: We used the risk of bias assessment for non-randomized studies of exposure and certainty assessment method proposed by Morgan et al. (2019). Using a multilevel meta-regression model, we quantitatively synthesized the data. RESULTS: The 14 reports represented 13 unique groups of subjects; the frequency of studies of a given antibody was Tetanus (n = 7); followed by Diphtheria (6); Measles (4); Rubella (3); Haemophilus influenzae type b and Influenza A H1N1 (2 each); and Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Influenza A H2N3, Influenza B, and Mumps (1 each). There were approximately 4,830 unique participants included in the analyses across the 14 reports. The models of coefficients between antibody concentration and the five principal PFAS showed homogeneity of associations across antibody types for each principal PFAS. In the models with all antibodies treated as one type, evidence of effect modification by life stage was present for PFOA and PFOS, and for consistency, all associations were evaluated for all ages and for children. The summary associations (coefficients for difference in log(e)[antibody concentration] per doubling of serum PFAS) with 95% confidence intervals that excluded zero ("statistical support"), and certainty of evidence ratings were as follows: for PFOA and all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.10, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.16, -0.03; moderate); for Diphtheria in children, -0.12 (-0.23, -0.00; high); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.17, -0.01; moderate), and for Tetanus in children, -0.12 (-0.24, -0.00; moderate). For PFOS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.11, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.18, -0.03; moderate); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.15, -0.03; high) and in children, -0.12 (-0.20, -0.04; high). For PFHxS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.03 (-0.06, -0.00; moderate) and in children, -0.05 (-0.09, -0.00; low); and for Rubella in children, -0.07 (-0.11, -0.02; high). Summary associations for PFNA and PFDA did not have statistical support, but all PFAS studied tended to have an inverse association with antibody concentrations. LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiologic data on immunosuppression and five principal PFAS suggest an association, with support across antibodies against multiple types of antigens. Data on Diphtheria, Rubella, and Tetanus were more supportive of an association than for other antibodies, and support was greater for associations with PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, than for PFNA or PFDA. The data on any specific antibody were scarce. Confounding factors that might account for the relation were not identified. Nearly all studies evaluated were judged to have a low or moderate risk of bias.},

  abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous in the environment and often ingested with food. PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based & no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I(2) = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques.},

METHODS: Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, China Biomedical Literature Service, CNCNKI, and Wanfang database were computerized to collect all case-control studies on the association between variety classes and different concentrations of environmental pollutant gas to fetal of prolonged bradycardia. After evaluating the quality of the inclusion study and extracting valid data, meta-analysis was performed using Stata15 software. Relative hazards were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method and the random effect model, and P values and I (2) values were used for heterogeneity evaluation. When heterogeneity occurs, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the sources. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included, including 1202 patients with fetal of prolonged bradycardia and 1380 in the control population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in PCP < 0.1 mg/L between the experimental group and control group (OR = 1.03, 95% CI (0.62, 1.72), P=0.90, I (2) = 0%, Z = 0.13), but there was a statistical difference in PCP > 5 mg/L (OR = 1.73, 95% CI (1.15, 2.58), P=0.008, I (2) = 0%, Z = 2.65), PCP > 10 mg/L (OR = 1.75, 95% CI (1.19, 2.57), P=0.004, I (2) = 14%, Z = 2.85), and PCP >15 mg/L (OR = 2.02, 95% CI (1.38, 2.95), P=0.0003, I (2) = 77%, Z = 3.61). CONCLUSION: In this study, we found that different concentrations of PCP increased the risk of long-term bradycardia in fetuses, and the risk coefficient increased with the increase of PCP concentration.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: The prevalence of wheeze and asthma has risen over recent decades for all age groups, especially children. These disorders can lead to decreased quality of life, missed school, urgent care and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and increased health care costs. Environmental exposures, including pesticide exposure, are likely a contributing factor to this increased prevalence. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association of pesticide exposure with childhood wheeze and asthma. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review evaluating studies of pesticide exposure (measured objectively) and child respiratory outcomes. We searched PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCO), Scopus (Elsevier), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Wiley), and ClinicalTrials. gov from 1988 - 2021. Main search keywords included "pesticides", "insecticides", "herbicides", "respiratory", "asthma" and "wheeze". RESULTS: Out of 5767 studies, 25 met the inclusion criteria; eight evaluated prenatal pesticide exposure (n=8407), twelve evaluated postnatal exposures (n= 50,488), and five evaluated pre-and postnatal exposures (n=20,919). Main pesticides investigated were dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) (14 studies) followed by organophosphates (7 studies). Primary methods of outcome assessment were questionnaire-based (84%), followed by spirometry (16%), registry data, and blood measures. Studies varied in the strength of evidence relating to study design and measures. Most studies (84%) reported a positive association of exposure with adverse child respiratory health. CONCLUSION: The studies suggest an association of pesticide exposure and childhood wheeze and asthma. The varying results and methods reinforce the need for more research and standardized approaches to these studies to confirm the suggested association of pesticide exposure and childhood wheeze and asthma.},

  abstract={INTRODUCTION: Although house flies (Musca domestica) do not directly cause disease in humans, they transmit pathogens to them, which provide the basis for many diseases. The main way to deal with this insect is to use insecticides. Due to the resistance from insecticides, the fight against house flies has been hampered. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies worldwide. METHODS: This study was conducted via a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies. Accordingly, by searching the databases of Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Proquest, Bioone, and Embase, all published articles were extracted, and reviewed until the end of May 2022. Statistical data analysis was performed using the random-effects model in the meta-analysis, meta-regression, and I(2) index. RESULTS: Nine studies entered the meta-analysis process. Based on this, the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticide in house flies was estimated to be 49.1%. Meta-regression showed that the prevalence of knockdown resistance increased with increasing years of study but decreased with increasing sample size. CONCLUSION: According to the findings, about 50% of house flies have knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticide. As a result, it is necessary to adopt effective and combined methods to combat this insect to control it and prevent the transmission of diseases caused by it.},

  abstract={The contamination of surface waters in China with Per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFASs) has been extensively studied in recent decades, however, almost all studies have been conducted in small areas and/or limited samples, which are not representative of the nationwide contamination of surface water environments with PFASs. In this study, attempt was made to provide a comprehensive report about PFASs pollution in Chinese surface water based on the PRISMA. By analyzing 111 papers published between 2006 and 2022, we provide a systematic review of the pollution of PFASs in surface water environments in China. The results show that 26 PFASs contaminants were detected at least once in China's surface water environment and were mainly concentrated in the eastern part of China. Most surface water environments in China had mean PFASs concentrations below 100 ng/L. The most polluted place was the Xiaoqing River, where sampling results in 2020 showed PFASs concentrations as high as 25,429 ng/L, followed by the Tangxun Lake, the Xi River, the Daling River, the Majia River, the Baiyangdian Lake, the Liuxi River, the Jiaolai River, the Tuo River and the Zhimai River. The Xiaoqing River also has the highest concentration of the novel pollutant, with concentrations of HFPO-TA and HFPO-DA as high as 1039 ng/L and 164 ng/L. Based on the source analysis, fluoropolymer manufacturing plants are the main source of PFASs pollutants in surface water. The results of the base risk analysis using risk quotients value (RQ) method show that the RQ values of the Xiaoqing River, the surface water near Bohai Bay, the Majia River and the Tuo River PFOA are 36.9, 7.7, 3.6 and 2.1 respectively, which are high risk areas and require enhanced control. This study provides information on surface waters contaminated by PFASs nationwide, and the results can be used as a reference for the development of pollution control and management strategies for PFASs in surface waters in China.},

Moreover, there is still controversy regarding the clinical effects of the treatment for unstable intertrochanteric fractures in the elderly. The Cochrane, Embase, PubMed, and other databases were searched, and a meta-analysis of the literature on the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures of the elderly with InterTan, PFNA, and PFNA-II was conducted. Seven studies were screened, with a total of 1236 patients. Our meta-analysis results show that InterTan is not significantly different from PFNA in terms of operation and fluoroscopy times, but it takes longer than PFNA-II. In terms of postoperative screw cut, pain, femoral shaft fracture, and secondary operations, InterTan is superior to PFNA and PFNA-II. Conversely, in terms of intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, and postoperative Harris score, there is no significant difference between InterTan and PFNA and PFNA-II. Compared to PFNA and PFNA-II, InterTan internal fixation has advantages in the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures in elderly individuals in terms of screw cutting, femoral shaft fractures, and secondary operations. However, InterTan operation and fluoroscopy times take longer than PFNA and PFNA-II.},

  abstract={Although previous meta-analyses have shown that prenatal PFASs exposure is associated with reduction in birth weight, effects of prenatal PFASs exposure on birth outcomes have not been fully explored. We conducted a meta-analysis of 23 eligible studies searched from Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science before March 21, 2021 to analyze the association between prenatal PFASs exposure and birth outcomes, including premature birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA) and miscarriage. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding confidence intervals were extracted for analysis. According to the heterogeneity of the included studies, fixed-effects (I(2) ≤ 50%) and random-effects (I(2) > 50%) models were applied respectively. The significant associations between PFOS and PTB (pooled OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.20-1.98), PFOA and miscarriage (pooled OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.15-1.70), and PFOS and LBW (pooled OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.19-1.94) were obtained. There were differences between included studies with different study regions, sampling time, and samples type used for PFASs assessment. These findings may provide insight in risk assessment and decision-making in producing products that contain PFASs.},

  abstract={We have performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the association between DDT/DDE and diabetes, searching PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for relevant articles published up to August 30, 2021, and eventually including 43 publications. Our researchers evaluate included studies' quality and risk of bias via the recommended tool. This study uses meta-analyses of random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our research identified 43 cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies, including 40,141 individuals in America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident diabetes were 1.61 (1.10-2.39) for DDT, 1.67 (1.41-1.98) for DDE. The subgroup analysis indicated that the association is significantly higher in the region of Asia for both DDT (OR = 2.73) and DDE (OR = 2.62). Besides, we also tried various types of stratification to identify the more influential confounding factors, among which regional factors have a significant influence. Study evidence suggests that exposure to DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, might be associated with the risk of incident diabetes. Among Asian patients, DDT/DDE concentrations are more closely associated with diabetes. Further studies in specific regions will be considered in the future.},

  abstract={Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent pollutants that may cause breast cancer. However, associations between exposure to PFASs and the risk of breast cancer are controversial. We retrieved studies on the association between PFASs—perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)—and breast cancer risk in women from PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted or calculated from provided data. Moreover, subgroup and metaregression analyses were performed to distinguish the potential sources of heterogeneity between studies. Lastly, eight original studies were included in the meta-analysis. PFOA and PFHxS were positively correlated with breast cancer risk, and the pooled ORs (and 95% CIs) were 1.32 (1.19 and 1.46) and 1.79 (1.51 and 2.11), respectively. PFNA was negatively correlated with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 0.76 (0.6 and 0.96), and PFOS was shown to have no correlation with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 1.01 (0.87 and 1.17). All results were merged in a random-effects model with significant heterogeneities (I2 > 90%, p < 0.001). The results demonstrated that PFASs might be potential risk factors for breast cancer, and the compounds in low exposure levels could have a more harmful impact on human health.},

  abstract={Thyroid cancer is considered as one of the most prevalent cancers in the world. Some pesticides can play a role as a potentially important risk factor in thyroid cancer by affecting thyroid morphology and thyroid hormone homeostasis. The aim of present study was to systematically review the available epidemiological evidence for human exposure to pesticides and thyroid cancer. Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science by suitable keywords from January 2000 to May 2021. Standard techniques for systematic reviews were followed in the current study and results reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, finally seven studies including four cohort studies and three case-control studies were reviewed. Organochlorines (OCPs) in more cases, Organophosphates (OPs) and Carbamates insecticides, herbicides and fungicides were the studied pesticides. Inconsistent results were reported in the surveyed articles on the OCPs. Two articles on the Carbamates (Carbaryl and Mancozeb) showed consistently an inverse association between exposure and thyroid cancer. Increased risk of thyroid cancer due to the exposure to the Malathion was reported in one article on the OPs. Due to the limited current knowledge about the effect of pesticides on thyroid cancer in humans, human health policies must be implemented to control individual's exposure to chemicals through using of botanical pesticides in agricultural. Also, more studies must be done to fill this gap of knowledge.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between maternal pesticide exposure and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) in offspring. METHOD: Five databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, as well as PsycINFO were systematically retrieved for the records related to pesticide exposure during pregnancy and ASD and ADHD in offspring before August 30, 2022. The pesticide category, maternal age and window of exposure as the main subgroups were presented. RESULTS: 949 studies were initially identified, and 19 studies were eventually included. Eleven were on ASD, seven were on ADHD, and one was on both disorders. Maternal pesticide exposure was positively related to ASD (pooled OR = 1.19 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.36)) and ADHD (pooled OR = 1.20 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.38)) in offspring. In the subgroup analysis, organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) (pooled OR = 1.14 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.24)), pyrethroid (pooled OR = 1.40 (95%CI: 1.09 to 1.80)), and maternal age ≥30 years old (pooled OR = 1.24 (95%CI: 1.10 to 1.40)) increased the risk of ASD in offspring. Maternal organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) exposure was a risk factor for ADHD in offspring (pooled OR = 1.22 (95%CI: 1.03 to 1.45)). CONCLUSION: Maternal pesticide exposure increased the risk of ASD and ADHD in offspring. Moreover, OPs, pyrethroid, and maternal age ≥30 years old were found to be risk factors affecting children's ASD. Maternal exposure to OCPs increased the risk of ADHD in offspring. Our findings contribute to our understanding of health risks related to maternal pesticide exposure and indicate that the in utero developmental period is a vulnerable window-of-susceptibility for ASD and ADHD risk in offspring. These findings should guide policies that limit maternal exposure to pesticides, especially for pregnant women living in agricultural areas.},

A literature search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus with 10-years temporal restriction and with search terms of ('pesticides') and ('maternal' or 'pregnancy' or 'gestational' or 'perinatal' or 'children' or 'infants' or 'birth weight' or 'gestational age' or 'cancer' or 'tumor' or 'malignancy' or 'carcinoma') and ('meta-analysis' or 'systematic review'). Using relative risk estimates, e.g., odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), ß coefficients, and 95% confidence interval (CI) as a prerequisite for inclusion/exclusion criteria a total of 19 eligible meta-analyses were included. The results showed that maternal domestic/occupational pesticide exposure increases the risk for childhood leukaemia. The overall OR regarding the risk of pesticide exposure and leukaemia was 1.23 to 1.57 with heterogeneity I(2) values that varied between 12.9% and 73%. Some studies found that exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p´-DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB-153) pesticides appears to decrease infant birth weight to some extent [p,p´-DDE (ß = -0.007 to -0.008)] and [PCB-153 (ß = -0.15 to -0.17)]Needing more studies on this relationship, our study found that pesticide exposure is a risk factor for leukaemia in children.},

Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from stratified random-effects meta-analyses by type of exposure and outcome. We also tested the potential heterogeneity across studies, conducted sensitivity analysis and evaluated publication bias. A total of 20 studies were finally included in our study. Meta-analytical effect estimates indicated a positive association between prenatal exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153 and PCB-170 and an increased risk of ASD, with OR of 1.89 (95% CI = 1.21-2.95, I(2) = 0%), 1.61 (95% CI = 1.05-2.47, I(2) = 0%) and 1.46 (95% CI = 1.03-2.06, I(2) = 0%) respectively. In contrast, PFDA was found inversely associated with the risk of ASD (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52-0.94, I(2) = 0%). The level of evidence supporting a link between ASD risk and exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153, PCB-170, and PFDA was respectively categorized as low, low, moderate, and low. In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-170 correlates with a heightened risk of ASD, with evidence levels rated as "low", "low", and "moderate", respectively. In contrast, PFDA exposure appears to be inversely associated with ASD risk, with a "low" level of supporting evidence. However, due to the limited number of studies available for each exposure and outcome pairing, these results should be interpreted with caution. Sufficiently powered studies are needed to validate our findings.},

  abstract={Most agricultural products are exposed to pesticides. Organochlorine (OCPs) insecticides have been banned for years due to their persistence in the environment and lipophilic properties. On the other hand, some carcinogenic organophosphates are used in high amounts. Therefore, this systematic review was performed with the keywords; pesticide, carcinogenic, carcinogen, residue, contamination, pollution, and food to determine the type of food and pesticide. 663 manuscripts were found by searching in databases. After initial screening and quality assessment of full text, 26 manuscripts were selected. In this study, by reviewing selected manuscripts, about 13 pesticides were associated with carcinogenic effects. These pesticides were Chlorothalonil, Glyphosate, Tetrachlorvinphos, Parathion, Malathion, Diazinon, heptachlor, Hexachlorobenzene, aldrin, dieldrin, DDT, chlordane, Lindane. Most of these pesticides were organochlorine. The organochlorine pesticides are primarily detected in foods of animal origin. In some studies, the amount of carcinogenic organochlorine was higher than the permissible levels. From the carcinogenic herbicide, Glyphosate. An important finding of this systematic review is that carcinogenic organochlorines are still a threat to cancer incidence.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Exposures to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), environmentally persistent chemicals detectable in the blood of most Americans, have been associated with several health outcomes. To offer insight into their possible biologic effects, we evaluated the metabolomic correlates of circulating PFOS and PFOA among 3,647 participants in eight nested case-control serum metabolomic profiling studies from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. METHODS: Metabolomic profiling was conducted by Metabolon Inc., using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem accurate mass spectrometry. We conducted study-specific multivariable linear regression analyses estimating the associations of metabolite levels with levels of PFOS or PFOA. For metabolites measured in at least 3 of 8 nested case-control studies, random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize study-specific results (1,038 metabolites in PFOS analyses and 1,100 in PFOA analyses). RESULTS: The meta-analysis identified 51 and 38 metabolites associated with PFOS and PFOA, respectively, at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level (4.8x10(-5) and 4.6x10(-5), respectively). For both PFOS and PFOA, the most common types of associated metabolites were lipids (sphingolipids, fatty acid metabolites) and xenobiotics (xanthine metabolites, chemicals). Positive associations were commonly observed with lipid metabolites sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0) (P = 2.0x10(-10) and 2.0x10(-8), respectively), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpropionate (P = 2.7x10(-15), 1.1x10(-17)), and lignoceroylcarnitine (C24) (P = 2.6x10(-8), 6.2x10(-6)). The strongest positive associations were observed for chemicals 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (P = 3.0x10(-112) and 6.8x10(-13), respectively) and 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (P = 1.6x10(-14), 2.3x10(-6)). Other metabolites positively associated with PFOS included D-glucose (carbohydrate), carotene diol (vitamin A metabolism), and L-alpha-aminobutyric acid (glutathione metabolism), while uric acid (purine metabolite) was positively associated with PFOA. PFOS associations were consistent even after adjusting for PFOA as a covariate, while PFOA associations were greatly attenuated with PFOS adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: In this large metabolomic study, we observed robust positive associations with PFOS for several molecules. Further investigation of these metabolites may offer insight into PFOS-related biologic effects.},

  abstract={Language development starts during the fetal period when the brain is sensitive to endocrine disruptions from environmental contaminants. This systematic review aims to systematically summarize the existing literature on early-life exposure to PFAS and children's language and communication development, which is an indicator of neurocognitive development. A structured literature search was conducted using three databases, PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL, last updated in April 2023. The population was defined as children and young adults. PFAS exposure was assessed pre- or postnatally. The outcome was defined as a language and communication ability assessed with validated instruments, parental self-reports, or clinical language disorder diagnoses. In total, 15 studies were identified for subsequent analyses. Thirteen were performed in background-exposed populations and two in highly exposed populations. There were some indications of potential adverse effects; however, these were not consistent across child sex, age of assessment, or PFAS exposure levels. No systematic effect of early-life PFAS exposure on language and communication development was found. These inconclusive findings may partly be explained by the use of general test instruments with limited validity as to children's language and communication development. Further studies over a wider exposure range using specific language test instruments are needed.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure can occur through ingestion of contaminated food and water, and inhalation of indoor air contaminated with these chemicals from consumer and industrial products. Prenatal PFAS exposures may confer risk for pregnancy-related outcomes such as hypertensive and metabolic disorders, preterm birth, and impaired fetal development through intermediate metabolic and inflammation pathways. OBJECTIVE: Estimate associations between maternal pregnancy PFAS exposure (individually and as a mixture) and bioactive lipids. METHODS: Our study included pregnant women in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes Program: Chemicals in our Bodies cohort (CiOB, n=73), Illinois Kids Developmental Study (IKIDS, n=287), and the ECHO-PROTECT cohort (n=54). We measured twelve PFAS in serum and 50 plasma bioactive lipids (parent fatty acids and eicosanoids derived from cytochrome p450, lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenase) during pregnancy (median 17 gestational weeks). Pairwise associations across cohorts were estimated using linear mixed models and meta-analysis. Associations between the PFAS mixture and individual bioactive lipids were estimated using quantile g-computation. RESULTS: PFDeA, PFOA, and PFUdA were associated (p<0.05) with changes in bioactive lipid levels in all three enzymatic pathways (cyclooxygenase [n=6 signatures]; cytochrome p450 [n=5 signatures]; lipoxygenase [n=7 signatures]) in at least one combined cohort analysis. The strongest signature indicated that a doubling in PFOA corresponded with a 24.3% increase (95% CI [7.3%, 43.9%]) in PGD2 (cyclooxygenase pathway) in the combined cohort. In the mixtures analysis, we observed nine positive signals across all pathways associated with the PFAS mixture. The strongest signature indicated that a quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was associated with a 34% increase in PGD2 (95% CI [8%, 66%]), with PFOS contributing most to the increase. CONCLUSIONS: Bioactive lipids were revealed as biomarkers of PFAS exposure and could provide mechanistic insights into PFAS' influence on pregnancy outcomes, informing more precise risk estimation and prevention strategies.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: This systematic review investigated whether people with patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) have muscle strength, volume, and activation around the hip and knee that is different from asymptomatic controls. METHODS: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation. Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least two studies reporting the same domain. RESULTS: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95%CI = -1.34 to -0.57), hip external rotation (-0.55;-1.07 to -0.03), hip extension (-0.72;-1.16 to -0.28), and knee extension (-0.97;-1.41 to -0.53) when compared to asymptomatic controls. People with PFOA also presented with smaller volumes of the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, tensor fascia lata, vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris when compared to asymptomatic controls. Also, people with PFOA presented with changes in muscle activation for the VL, VM and gluteus maximus (GMax) when compared to asymptomatic controls. CONCLUSION: People with PFOA present with lower strength and volume of the hip and quadriceps muscles and altered muscle activation of the VM, VL and GMax during ascending and descending stairs when compared to asymptomatic controls.

  abstract={PURPOSE: Environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a mixture of chemical compounds capable to interfere with endocrine axis at different levels and to which population is daily exposed. This paper aims to review the relationship between EDCs and breast, prostate, testicle, ovary, and thyroid cancer, discussing carcinogenic activity of known EDCs, while evaluating the impact on public health. METHODS: A literature review regarding EDCs and cancer was carried out with particular interest on meta-analysis and human studies. RESULTS: The definition of EDCs has been changed through years, and currently there are no common criteria to test new chemicals to clarify their possible carcinogenic activity. Moreover, it is difficult to assess the full impact of human exposure to EDCs because adverse effects develop latently and manifest at different ages, even if preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that developing fetus and neonates are most vulnerable to endocrine disruption. CONCLUSION: EDCs represent a major environmental and health issue that has a role in cancer development. There are currently some EDCs that can be considered as carcinogenic, like dioxin and cadmium for breast and thyroid cancer; arsenic, asbestos, and dioxin for prostate cancer; and organochlorines/organohalogens for testicular cancer. New evidence supports the role of other EDCs as possible carcinogenic and pregnant women should avoid risk area and exposure. The relationship between EDCs and cancer supports the need for effective prevention policies increasing public awareness.},

  abstract={Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are among the most frequently detected chemicals among the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in aquatic environments. Because of their high detection frequency, persistence, and potential toxicity, interest in both PFOA and PFOS has increased in recent years. However, a substantial number of PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests only report nominal, or unmeasured, treatment concentrations, which may complicate the determination of protective values. In addition, previous literature has indicated that differences between nominal and measured concentrations of both PFOA and PFOS could be linked to experimental conditions (e.g., feeding regimes for test organisms, test vessel material [glass or plastic], use of solvent, and the presence of substrate). Therefore, this critical review examined whether nominal and measured concentrations were in close agreement with each other among the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature and if experimental conditions were associated with any observed differences. Nominal and measured concentrations in the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature generally displayed a high degree of linear correlation and relatively low median percent differences. Correlations between measured and nominal concentrations were >0.98 for PFOA and >0.95 for PFOS in freshwater tests across experimental conditions. For saltwater tests, correlations of >0.84 were observed for PFOA and PFOS (separate and combined) across experimental conditions. While measured PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests are generally preferred, the present meta-analysis demonstrated that experimental conditions had little influence on observed discrepancies between nominal and measured concentrations, with the exception of PFOS saltwater tests and PFOA and PFOS freshwater studies that contained substrate. Unmeasured tests with these conditions should be considered carefully based on project needs, with the caveat that the data sets for these two experimental conditions were limited.

  abstract={INTRODUCTION: Pesticides are toxic and biological substances used for mitigating harmful pests. Their application in agricultural fields and homes increased environmental pollution. Studies showed their harmful effects on human health, specifically children, who are more vulnerable than adults. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has introduced several pesticides as carcinogens. This study aims to systematically summarize and review all studies related to pesticides and cancer. METHODOLOGY: This systematic review is based on PRISMA rules. Three central databases were employed to find studies on pesticide exposure and cancer correlation published from 2017 to September 2022. RESULTS: After reviewing several studies, we found that most studies revealed a significant relationship between pesticide exposure and an increased cancer incidence rate. Among the most studied group of pesticides is organochlorine (OC) pesticides. OC pesticides and their residues could significantly increase cancer in children and adults. Mechanistic studies revealed that pesticides could increase the risk of different cancers by genetics, like an increased expression of some genes like p21, p53 or epigenetic impairments. Cell cycle impairments like expanding the G1 to S phase transition are another mechanism of causing cancer. DNA methylation and histone modifications increase the risk of numerous cancers. CONCLUSION: Based on epidemiological studies, pesticides are a significant concern to human health, specifically cancer development, and should be more restrained. Their most reported mechanism of action were genetic and epigenetic impairments which cause cancers.},

  abstract={Perfluorohexyloctane (F6H8), a physically and chemically inert synthetic compound, has recently emerged as a promising candidate for the treatment of DED due to its unique properties. A systematic review that only include full-length randomized controlled studies (RCTs), reporting the effects of F6H8 in three databases, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, was performed according to the PRISMA statement. The search period was performed between June 1, 2023, and June 21, 2023. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to analyze the quality of the studies selected. A total of six RCTs were included in this systematic review. F6H8 tear substitutes treatment achieved a higher improvement than control group interventions in most of the reported variables. The mean differences between both groups were in favor of F6H8 and were as follow: eye dryness score (EDS) base on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of -6.12 ± 4.3 points, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire score of -2.8 ± 2.3 points, lipid layer thickness (LLT) of 11.4 ± 10.4 μm, total corneal fluorescein staining (tCFS) of -0.8 ± 0.3 points and ocular treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of -0.66 ± 1.7. Tear film break-up time (TBUT) was the only variable in favor of control group with a mean of -0.5 ± 0.4 s. Patient satisfaction after F6H8 tear substitutes treatment was high. Therefore, F6H8 tear substitutes improve dry eye symptoms and signs with a satisfactory tolerability and could be recommended in patients with DED.},

  abstract={In 2020, 55 million people worldwide were living with dementia, and this number is projected to reach 139 million in 2050. However, approximately 75% of people living with dementia have not received a formal diagnosis. Hence, they do not have access to treatment and care. Without effective treatment in the foreseeable future, it is essential to focus on modifiable risk factors and early intervention. Central auditory processing is impaired in people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and its preclinical stages and may manifest many years before clinical diagnosis. This study systematically reviewed central auditory processing function in AD and its preclinical stages using behavioural central auditory processing tests. Eleven studies met the full inclusion criteria, and seven were included in the meta-analyses. The results revealed that those with mild cognitive impairment perform significantly worse than healthy controls within channel adaptive tests of temporal response (ATTR), time-compressed speech test (TCS), Dichotic Digits Test (DDT), Dichotic Sentence Identification (DSI), Speech in Noise (SPIN), and Synthetic Sentence Identification-Ipsilateral Competing Message (SSI-ICM) central auditory processing tests. In addition, this analysis indicates that participants with AD performed significantly worse than healthy controls in DDT, DSI, and SSI-ICM tasks. Clinical implications are discussed in detail.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a large class of chemicals with widespread use and persistence in the environment and in humans; however, most of the epidemiology research has focused on a small subset. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were considered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for "legacy" PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SEM highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11185.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: The prenatal environment influences lifetime health; epigenetic mechanisms likely predominate. In 2016, the first international consortium paper on cigarette smoking during pregnancy and offspring DNA methylation identified extensive, reproducible exposure signals. This finding raised expectations for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of other exposures. OBJECTIVE: We review the current state-of-the-science for DNA methylation associations across prenatal exposures in humans and provide future recommendations. METHODS: We reviewed 134 prenatal environmental EWAS of DNA methylation in newborns, focusing on 51 epidemiological studies with meta-analysis or replication testing. Exposures spanned cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, air pollution, dietary factors, psychosocial stress, metals, other chemicals, and other exogenous factors. Of the reproducible DNA methylation signatures, we examined implementation as exposure biomarkers. RESULTS: Only 19 (14%) of these prenatal EWAS were conducted in cohorts of 1,000 or more individuals, reflecting the still early stage of the field. To date, the largest perinatal EWAS sample size was 6,685 participants. For comparison, the most recent genome-wide association study for birth weight included more than 300,000 individuals. Replication, at some level, was successful with exposures to cigarette smoking, folate, dietary glycemic index, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter  < 10 μm and  < 2.5 μm, nitrogen dioxide, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, electronic waste, PFAS, and DDT. Reproducible effects of a more limited set of prenatal exposures (smoking, folate) enabled robust methylation biomarker creation. DISCUSSION: Current evidence demonstrates the scientific premise for reproducible DNA methylation exposure signatures. Better powered EWAS could identify signatures across many exposures and enable comprehensive biomarker development. Whether methylation biomarkers of exposures themselves cause health effects remains unclear. We expect that larger EWAS with enhanced coverage of epigenome and exposome, along with improved single-cell technologies and evolving methods for integrative multi-omics analyses and causal inference, will expand mechanistic understanding of causal links between environmental exposures, the epigenome, and health outcomes throughout the life course. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12956.},

  abstract={Emerging pollutants (EPs) create a worldwide concern owing to their low concentration and severe toxicity to the receptors. The prominent emerging pollutants categories as pharmaceutical and personal care product, plasticizer, surfactants, and persistent organic pollutants. Typically, EPs are widely disseminated in the aquatic ecosystem and capable of perturbing the physiology of water bodies as well as humans. The primary sources of EPs in the environment include anthropogenic release, atmospheric deposition, untreated or substandard treated wastewater, and extreme weather events. Intensive research has been done covering the environmental distribution, ecological disturbance, fate, and removal of EPs in the past decades. However, a systematic review on the distribution of EPs in the engineered and natural aquatic environment and the degradation of different EPs by using anaerobic sludge, aerobic bacteria, and isolated strains are limited. This review article aims to highlight the importance, application, and future perceptions of using different microbes to degrade EPs. Overall, this review article illustrates the superiority of using non-cultivable and cultivable microbes to degrade the EPs as an eco-friendly approach. Practically, the outcomes of this review paper will build up the knowledge base solutions to remove EPs from the wastewater.},

  abstract={The increase in pesticide consumption has a negative health impact. Studies point to an association between exposure to pesticides and cardiovascular disease (CVD), one of the leading causes of world mortality. This review synthesize evidence on the association between occupational exposure and environmental contamination by pesticides with CVDs from 1750 references databases (EBSCO, Medline, Science Direct, Scielo, Lilacs and Ovid) without date or language restriction. Selected 24 articles by PRISMA and Downs & Black methodologies, were included from inclusion criteria: original studies (case-control, cohort or cross-sectional design); clear CVD definition and exposure to pesticides; representative sample of the target population. The results show the occupational exposure to pesticides chlorpyrifos, coumafos, carbofuran, ethylene bromide, mancozeb, ziram, metalaxyl, pendimethalin and trifluralin was associated a risk of 1.8 to 3.2 for acute myocardial infarction. Primaphos, fenitrothion, malathion and deltamethrin pesticides were associated with a blood pressure increase. Environmental contamination by tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was associated with CVD with risk of 1.09 to 2.78 and organochlorine, 1.19 to 4.54; heavy metals, arsenic, trimethylarsine and dimethylarsinic acid with atherosclerosis and systemic arterial hypertension. These findings point to the association between exposure to pesticides and CVD, signaling the importance of greater rigor in the public policy related to pesticides.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence suggests that p,p'-DDE might be involved in the development of diabetes and hypertension (HTN); however, the evidence in humans is inconclusive. OBJECTIVE: To summarize the epidemiological evidence for the association of p,p'-DDT exposure and its breakdown products with the risk of diabetes and HTN from prospective studies. METHODS: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Eligible studies (prospective) were search in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and SciELO databases (July 11, 2020). Different search algorithms were used for diabetes and HTN. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated from meta-analysis with random effects for each exposure and outcome. RESULTS: A total of 23 prospective studies were included in this review, 16 assessed diabetes and seven HTN; very few measured p,p'-DDT. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was associated with a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (pooled OR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.00, 2.07; p = 0.049) and HTN (pooled OR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.38). Dose-response meta-analysis suggested a non-linear relation between p,p'-DDE and T2D. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was not associated with gestational diabetes (pooled OR = 1.01; 95%CI: 0.94, 1.09); similarly, p,p'-DDT was not associated with T2D (pooled OR = 1.03; 95%CI: 0.79, 1.35). CONCLUSIONS: Evidence from prospective studies suggests that exposure to p,p'-DDE, the main breakdown product of p,p'-DDT, might increase the risk of developing T2D; such increase may be apparent only at low levels. Exposure to p,p'-DDE may also increase the risk of having HTN; however, further evidence is required.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Knowledge surrounding the association between exposure to pesticides and hypothyroidism is inconsistent and controversial. METHODS: The aim of present study was, therefore, to review scientific evidence systematically and conduct a meta-analysis into the contribution of exposure to pesticides to hypothyroidism. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched. The findings are presented as OR, HR, PR, IRR, and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). A fixed-effect model using the inverse-variance method and random-effects inverse-variance model with DerSimonian-Laird method were used for estimating the pooled estimates. Cochran Q and I(2) tests were used to confirm the heterogeneity of selected studies. RESULTS: Twelve studies were included in the systematic review, and 9 studies in the meta-analysis. Epidemiological evidence suggested that exposure to insecticides including organochlorines, organophosphates, and pyrethroids increased risk of hypothyroidism (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.14, 1.33 for organochlorines, aOR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.07, 1.17 for organophosphates, aOR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.03, 1.28 for pyrethroids). Exposure to herbicides also increased risk of hypothyroidism (aOR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.02, 1.10). However, exposure to fungicides and fumigants was not found to be associated with hypothyroidism. CONCLUSION: To increase current knowledge and confirm evidence to date future research needs to center on large-scale longitudinal epidemiological and biological studies, examination of dose-response relationships, the controlling of relevant confounding variables, using standardized and high sensitivity tools, and investigating the effects of environmental exposure.},

  abstract={Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) is a large group of fluorinated synthetic chemicals, e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Many epidemiological studies have found that PFAS exposure is associated with hypertension risk, but others possess a different opinion. Overall, the relationship between PFASs and hypertension risk remains controversial. We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between PFAS exposure and human risk of hypertension.We conducted a meta-analysis based on population-involving studies published from 1975 to 2023, which we collected from Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases. The odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD), with their 95% confidence interval (CI), were used to assess the risk of hypertension with PFAS exposure. The statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the Q-test and I(2) statistics. Research publications related to our meta-analysis topic were systematically reviewed.Fourteen studies involving 71,663 participants, in which 26,281 suffered hypertension, met the inclusion criteria. Our analyses suggest that exposure to general PFAS (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04-1.14) or PFOS (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05-1.30) is associated with hypertension risk. Specifically, elevated levels of general PFAS (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.08-0.42), PFHxS (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.07-0.27), and PFDA (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.02-0.13) are associated with a high risk of hypertension.Our meta-analysis indicates that PFAS exposure is a risk factor for hypertension, and increased hypertension risk is associated with higher PFAS levels. Further study may eventually provide a better and more comprehensive elucidation of the potential mechanism of this association.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Although numerous studies have examined the effect of prenatal per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure on neurodevelopment in children, findings have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVE: To better understand the effects of PFAS exposure during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopment, we conducted a systematic review of prenatal exposure to different types of PFAS and neurodevelopment in children. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE electronic databases up to March 2023. Only birth cohort studies that report a specific association between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and neurodevelopment were included in this review. RESULTS: 31 birth cohort studies that met the inclusion criteria were qualitatively integrated. Among these, 14 studies investigated the impact of PFAS exposure during pregnancy on cognition, 13 on neurobehavior, and 4 on both cognition and neurobehavior. Additionally, 4 studies explored the influence of PFAS on children's comprehensive development. CONCLUSION: Prenatal PFAS exposure was associated with poor neurodevelopment in children, including psychomotor development, externalizing behavior, and comprehensive development. However, conclusive evidence regarding its effects on other neurological outcomes remains limited. In addition, sex-specific effects on social behavior and sleep problems were identified.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Globally, the burden of breast cancer has increased significantly in recent decades. Emerging evidence suggested that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have the potential to interfere with the function of normal hormones, may play a crucial role in this trend. However, the potential relationships were inconsistent in various studies. OBJECTIVE AND SEARCH METHODS: In our study, we sought to fully evaluate the currently available epidemiological evidence to ascertain whether certain EDC congeners and their metabolites are related to breast cancer risk. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in three electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Publications that covered xenobiotic EDC exposures and breast cancer-confirmed histological results or antecedent medical records or reporting to health registers were taken into consideration. OUTCOMES: The final result of the literature search was 6,498 references, out which we found 67 publications that matched the requirements for meta-analysis and eight publications for qualitative trend synthesis. In this meta-analysis, statistically significant associations revealed that (i) 1-chloro-4-[2,2,2-trichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene (p,p'-DDT) and its major metabolite 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were somewhat related to a greater risk of breast cancer. However, this relationship only existed in blood serum but not in adipose tissue. (ii) Breast cancer risk was increased by exposure to chlordane and hexachlorocyclohexane. (iii) Five polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 99, PCB 105, PCB 118, PCB 138, and PCB 183) can increase the risk of breast cancer. (iv) One phthalate congener (BBP) and one per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance congener (PFDoDA) were negatively associated with breast cancer risk. Unfortunately, heterogeneity was not well explained in our review, and a limited number of available prospective studies investigating the associations between EDC exposure and breast cancer were included in our meta-analysis. To elucidate the overall associations, future large, longitudinal epidemiological investigations are needed.

  abstract={BACKGROUND: A large body of emerging evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) affect birth outcomes in various pathways, but the evidence is inconsistent. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. METHODS: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. RESULTS: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from -181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = -360.620 to -1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to -24.252 g (95% CI = -38.574 to -9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be "moderate". CONCLUSION: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and fully considering the possible confounders.},

  abstract={Pesticides reach aquatic ecosystems and interact with various targets in cells of fish and other living organisms. Toxicity originates during the metabolization process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult) influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish.},

  abstract={INTRODUCTION: Focal therapy (FT) is a promising alternative with curative intent for Low- to Intermediate-risk localized Prostate Cancer (PCa), claiming better functional outcomes and safety profile than standard whole-gland treatments. Ten different FT modalities have been described in the literature. The objective of our narrative review is to evaluate the safety profile and functional outcomes of these different modalities and the current most used tools of assessment for those outcomes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Literature search was performed on 21st February 2023 using PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). Articles reporting whole-gland treatments were excluded. All articles reporting functional outcomes were included. RESULTS: One-hundred-seven studies, reporting data on 6933 patients, were included (26 on High Intensity Focal Ultrasound, 22 on Focal Cryotherapy, 14 on Irreversible Electroporation, 11 on Focal brachytherapy, 10 on Focal Laser Ablation, 8 on Photodynamic Therapy, 3 on Microwave ablation, 3 on Robotic Partial Prostatectomy, 2 on bipolar Radio Frequency Ablation, 1 on Prostatic Artery Embolization, and 7 studies comparing different FTs). Post-operative pad-free rate ranged between 92.3-100%. Greater heterogeneity exists considering the Change in Erectile Function, with Changing in Erectile function- rates ranging between 0-94.4% (Cryotherapy). The most used Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) were the International Prostate Symptom Score and the International Index of Erectile Function for incontinence/urinary function and potency, respectively. The most common reported complications were hematuria, infections, and urethral strictures, with rates widely ranging among different treatments. The Clavien-Dindo Classification was the most used (40/88 papers) to describe adverse events. CONCLUSION: FT is a promising treatment for localized PCa, achieving excellent results in terms of safety and functional outcomes. There is a wide heterogeneity in the definition of PROMS and time of collection between studies. High quality comparative studies with standard treatments are needed to reinforce these findings.},

  abstract={The role of environmental chemicals in the etiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been of interest in recent research. This scoping review aims to summarize known or possible associations between ADHD and environmental exposures to substances selected as priority chemicals of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Literature searches were performed in PubMed to identify relevant publications. Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward. More research is needed for stronger evidence of associations or the lack of an association between specific chemical exposures and ADHD.},

  abstract={Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are ubiquitous in environment, which have attracted increasing concerns in recent years. This study collected the data on PFAAs concentrations in 1042 soil samples from 15 countries and comprehensively reviewed the spatial distribution, sources, sorption mechanisms of PFAAs in soil and their plant uptake. PFAAs are widely detected in soils from many countries worldwide and their distribution is related to the emission of the fluorine-containing organic industry. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are found to be the predominant PFAAs in soil. Industrial emission is the main source of PFAAs contributing 49.9% of the total concentrations of PFAAs (Ʃ PFAAs) in soil, followed by activated sludge treated by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (19.9%) and irrigation of effluents from WWTPs, usage of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFFs) and leaching of leachate from landfill (30.2%). The adsorption of PFAAs by soil is mainly influenced by soil pH, ionic strength, soil organic matter and minerals. The concentrations of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in soil are negatively correlated with the length of carbon chain, log K(ow), and log K(oc). The carbon chain lengths of PFAAs are negatively correlated with the root-soil concentration factors (RCFs) and shoot-soil concentration factors (SCFs). The uptake of PFAAs by plant is influenced by physicochemical properties of PFAAs, plant physiology and soil environment. Further studies should be conducted to make up the inadequacy of existing knowledge on the behavior and fate of PFAAs in soil-plant system.},

The unregulated discharge of MPs in water sources and the absence of required MP filter technology in water treatment plants are important routes of MP exposure through drinking water. The presence of MPs in food may lead to the accumulation of MPs in the body. Exposure to MPs can occur through airborne fallout and dust inhalation in both indoor and outdoor environments. This review summarizes the MP exposure sources and possible pathways in the human body, and illustrates that the intake of drinking water, food consumption, and air inhalation should be assessed in during routine activities.

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Humans are exposed to several per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) daily; however, most previous studies have focused on individual PFAS. Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. OBJECTIVES: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. METHODS: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. RESULTS: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures' effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). CONCLUSION: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted.},

  abstract={Global sperm counts have declined in recent decades, coinciding with the proliferation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, of which pesticides are some of the most common. Previous systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies published between 1991 through 2013 have reported associations between environmental and occupational pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality, particularly associations with reduced sperm concentration. This systematic review used the Navigation Guide to critically evaluate the current body of evidence examining sperm quality and pesticide exposure in epidemiological studies. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for all English-language articles published after September 2012 until August 2021. Original observational studies that assessed human sperm quality parameters, defined as concentration, motility, morphology, and DNA integrity, and individual-level pesticide exposure were included. The risk of bias for each included study and the strength of evidence were evaluated using the Navigation Guide protocol. Nineteen studies assessing environmental or occupational pesticide exposure and sperm parameters were included. Eighteen studies were cross-sectional studies and one prospective cohort; sample sizes ranged from 42 to 2122 men from 14 different countries. Fifteen (79 %) studies found at least one significant association between pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality. The overall risk of bias across studies was classified as low to moderate. The quality of evidence was determined to be moderate based on systematic evaluation criteria. There were consistent adverse associations between pesticide exposure and sperm motility (63 % of studies) and DNA integrity (80 % of studies). For sperm concentration and morphology, 42 % and 36 % of studies found significant negative associations, respectively. The strength of the body of evidence overall was rated as having sufficient evidence of toxicity. Regarding specific sperm endpoints, there was sufficient evidence that pesticides are toxic for sperm motility and DNA integrity; limited evidence of toxicity for sperm concentration; and inadequate evidence of toxicity for sperm morphology. The studies reviewed here showed consistent associations between pesticide exposure and diminished sperm parameters, particularly sperm motility and sperm DNA integrity. These findings are largely consistent with results of previous reviews, which have found significant negative associations between pesticide exposure and sperm quality in 13 of 20 (65 %) studies published between 1991 and 2008, and in 14 of 17 (82 %) studies published between 2008 and 2012. After thirty years of mounting evidence, actions are needed to reduce pesticide risks to testicular function and male fertility.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: The present systematic review aimed to verify the association between Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) in children. Design A systematic search was conducted in four databases and the grey literature. The risk of bias of the studies was analyzed with the aid of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A quantitative synthesis was performed through meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each result using the Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. RESULTS: Thirteen studies (seven cross-sectional, two cohort and four case-control studies) were included in the qualitative analysis and eleven were included in the meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were conducted considering general DDE (regardless of the type of defect), hypoplasia, molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) and hypomineralized primary second molars (HPSM). Subgroups based on the type of dentition were also analyzed. Children of mothers who had GDM presented a greater likelihood of general DDE (OR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.66-4.44), MIH (OR = 3.14; 95% CI: 1.20-8.25) and hypoplasia (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.36-3.46). No association was found between HPSM and GDM (OR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.17-2.20). An association was found between GDM and DDE in the permanent dentition. Therefore, children whose mothers had GDM were more likely to present DDE compared to those whose mothers did not have this metabolic disorder. CONCLUSIONS: The results should be interpreted with caution due to the low evidence of the primary studies.},

  abstract={INTRODUCTION: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals humans can be exposed to from occupational or environmental sources. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examined the association between PFAS exposure, particularly Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), and Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid (PFOS), and risk of kidney, liver, and testicular cancer. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed to identify cohort and case-control studies reported after the Monograph of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the Toxicological Profile of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. We assessed the quality of the studies by using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Forest relative risk (RR) plots were constructed for liver, kidney, and testicular cancer. We conducted stratified analyses by geographic region, study design, quality score, outcome, years of publication, exposure source, and PFAS type. A random-effects model was used to address heterogeneity between studies. RESULTS: Fifteen studies, including ten cohort studies, three case-control studies nested in a cohort, and two case-control studies were included after removing duplicate and irrelevant reports. We found an association between overall PFAS exposure and the risk of kidney cancers (RR=1.18, 95% CI =1.05-1.32; I =52.8%, 11 studies). Also, we showed an association between high-level exposure to PFAS and kidney cancer (RR=1.74, 95% CI =1.23-2.47; p=0.005) and testicular cancer (RR=2.22, 95% CI =1.12-4.39; p=0.057). There was no association with liver cancer. We found no heterogeneity by geographical region, PFAS type, study design, outcome, quality score, year of publication, or exposure source. Only two studies reported results among women. CONCLUSIONS: We detected an association between overall PFAS exposure and kidney cancer and high doses of PFAS with testicular cancer. However, bias and confounding cannot be excluded, precluding a conclusion in terms of causality.},

  abstract={Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles published in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, we identified nine articles that provide evidence of the relationship between persistent organic pollutants and hyperuricemia. Our researchers assess the quality of the included studies and their risk of bias using the recommended method and tool. This study uses meta-analyses of the random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that the risk of hyperuricemia was strongly associated with three perfluorinated compounds, PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS, with the OR(95%CI) of 1.26 (1.07-1.47), 1.44(1.15-1.79), and 1.23(1.01-1.50) respectively. We also found a weak association between two other perfluorinated compounds, PFDA and PFHxS. Other than that, the summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident hyperuricemia were 2.34 (1.79-3.08) for DDT, 3.25(2.40-4.39) for DDE, 2.57 (1.37-4.81) for PCBs and 3.05(2.22-4.19) in trans-nonanchlor. Therefore, DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, PCBs, and trans-nonanchlor have also been linked with an increased risk of hyperuricemia in humans. This study finds that persistent organic pollutant is a critical factor for hyperuricemia, and further studies in specific regions will be considered in the future.},

  abstract={Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) include a series of conditions that can be poorly tolerated, negatively affecting the quality of life. Current treatment options show unsatisfactory results and new ones are therefore needed. Stem cell (SC) therapy might be an alternative treatment strategy. This systematic review aims to define the state of art of SC therapy for PFDs in clinical trials, by systematically reviewing the available evidence. A systematic search strategy was conducted up to November 7, 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science. Preclinical studies on animal models were not considered. Studies were included when the patients were affected by any PFDs and cells were isolated, cultured, and characterized as SC. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020216551). A total of 11 prospective clinical studies were included in the final assessment, specifically 7 single-arm studies dealing with SC therapy for stress urinary incontinence and 4 with anal incontinence. Among the latter, there were two prospective, single-arm studies and two randomized controlled trials. No papers concerning the use of SC for prolapse repair were retrieved. Due to the great heterogeneity, data pooling was not possible. Stem cell injection resulted in a safe procedure, with few mild adverse side effects, mostly related to harvesting sites. However, a clear beneficial impact of SC treatment for the treatment of pelvic floor disorders could not be demonstrated. Further larger targeted studies with control arms are needed before any conclusions can be made.},

  abstract={Vaccines are essential for children to defend against infection. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants with the characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation. PFAS exposure can affect the function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological studies investigating potential relationships between PFAS exposure and vaccine antibody levels, and assessed whether PFAS would affect vaccine response in healthy children. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few studies are available. Further studies are needed to validate the possible associations.},

  abstract={Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) such as dichlorodimethyltrichloroethane (DDT) are present and ubiquitous in the environment due to their resilient nature. DDT is a prevalent endocrine disruptor still found in detectable amounts in organisms and the environment even after its use was banned in the 1970s. Medline and Google Scholar were systematically searched to detect all relevant animal and human studies published in the last 20 years (January 2003 to February 2023) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. In total, 38 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. This systematic search and review indicated that exposure to DDT is associated with female reproductive health issues, such as reduced fecundability; increased risk of preterm/premature deliveries; increased periods of gestation; alterations in the synthesis of crucial reproductive hormones (Progesterone and Oxytocin) through ion imbalances and changes in prostaglandin synthesis, myometrial and stromal hypertrophy, and edema; and variations in uterine contractions through increased uterine wet weight. There was also limited evidence indicating DDT as a carcinogen sufficient to instigate reproductive cancers. However, this review only takes into account the in vitro studies that have established a possible pathway to understand how DDT impacts female infertility and leads to reproductive cancers. Links between the pathways described in various studies have been developed in this review to produce a summarized picture of how one event might lead to another. Additionally, epidemiological studies that specifically targeted the exposure to DDT of females belonging to various ethnicities have been reviewed to develop an overall picture of prevailing female reproductive health concerns in different nations.},

  abstract={Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is a collective name for approximately 4700 synthetic chemicals ubiquitous in the aquatic environment worldwide. They are used in a wide array of products and are found in living organisms around the world. Some PFAS have been associated with cancer, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption, and other health effects. Only a fraction of PFAS are currently monitored and regulated and the presence and effects on aquatic organisms of many PFAS are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the health effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS on aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The main result shows that PFAS in concentrations up to 13.5 μg/L have adverse effects on body size variables for secondary consumers. However, no significant effects on liver or gonad somatic indices and neither on fecundity were found. In addition, the results show that there are large research gaps for PFAS effects on different organisms in aquatic environments at environmentally relevant concentrations. Most studies have been performed on secondary consumers and there is a substantial lack of studies on other consumers in aquatic ecosystems.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Existing evidence indicates that exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may increase the risk of hypertension, but the findings are inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to explore the relationship between PFASs and hypertension through this systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science databases for articles published in English that examined the relationship between PFASs and hypertension before 13 August 2022. The random effects model was used to aggregate the evaluation using Stata 15.0 for Windows. We also conducted subgroup analyses by region and hypertension definition. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the robustness of the findings. RESULTS: The meta-analysis comprised 15 studies in total with 69,949 individuals. The risk of hypertension was substantially and positively correlated with exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.51), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.26), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.09). However, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and hypertension were not significantly associated (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.17). CONCLUSION: We evaluated the link between PFASs exposure and hypertension and discovered that higher levels of PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS were correlated with an increased risk of hypertension. However, further high-quality population-based and pathophysiological investigations are required to shed light on the possible mechanism and demonstrate causation because of the considerable variability.

  abstract={Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS), ubiquitously present in the environment and biota, are transferred to the fetus via the placenta. PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: In Iran, the prospect of malaria control relies mainly on insecticides used against the genus Anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae) as important vectors of malaria, arboviruses, and so on. Only eight out of 30 malaria mosquito vectors (Anopheles species) have been examined for insecticide resistance in Iran. This study aimed to review articles related to the incremental trend in insecticide resistance and their mechanisms among anopheline malaria vectors in Iran. METHODS: A literature review was conducted based on such search engines as Iran doc, Web of Science, SID, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar websites using the following keywords: "Anopheles," "Malaria," "Resistance," "Vectors," "Insecticide Resistance," and "Iran" for data collection. Published papers in English or Persian covering 1980 to 2020 were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 1125 articles were screened, only 16 of which were filtered to be pertinent in this review. While most of the mosquito vectors of malaria, such as Anopheles stephensi, were resistant to DDT, dieldrin, malathion, and becoming less susceptible to deltamethrin and other synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, few like Anopheles fluviatilis s. l. were susceptible to all insecticides. A disseminating trend in insecticide resistance among different anopheline mosquito vector species was evident. Metabolic and insecticide target-site resistance mechanisms were involved with organochlorines and pyrethroids, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Insecticide resistance is becoming a severe scourge to the effectiveness of vector-borne disease management measures. This event is especially critical in developing and marginalized communities that applied chemical-based vector elimination programs for malaria; therefore, it is crucial to monitor insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Iran using biochemical and molecular tools.},

  abstract={PURPOSE: Accumulating research suggests that psychotherapy helps improve abstinence but the difference in the efficacy of multiple psychotherapies in alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains to be explored. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A systematic search of databases (Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and EBSCO) for studies (published from inception to April 10th.) of adults diagnosed with AUD accepting psychotherapies was conducted. Studies covering 9 countries and regions. The qualitative analysis pooled 2646 individuals from 34 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the networks included 1928 participants (23 RCTs). The outcomes included percentage of days abstinent (PDA), change in drinks per drinking day (change in DDD), and change in craving compared among individuals accepting various psychotherapies. The protocol followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). RESULTS: For the network of PDA, motivational enhancement treatment (MET) (35.44, 11.78 to 59.09, high-certainty) and couple therapy (CT) (28.89, 13.42 to 44.36, moderate-certainty) were significantly different from treatment as usual (TAU) with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) mean rank 1.9 and 1.9 respectively. TAU+supportive psychotherapy (SP) was better than TAU for the change in DDD in the high-quality direct comparison. CONCLUSION: The motivational enhancement and the couple therapy show potential amelioration for alcohol abstinence. Additionally, the preferred interventions are different for improving PDA and change in DDD. The evidence network remains to be strengthened.},

  abstract={Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may lead to dysregulated inflammatory responses, however, the detailed relationship between different EDCs and inflammation remains unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between four types of EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates (PAEs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) and markers of inflammation and immune responses in humans. Three databases were searched, and 36 studies with a total of 22055 participants were included. The associations between EDCs and 26 inflammation-related acute phase proteins and cytokines were analyzed. The results demonstrated that exposure to BPA was positively associated with circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6. Exposure to PAEs was associated with elevated levels of CRP, IL-6 and IL-10. Subgroup analysis found that three PAE metabolites mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were directly associated with a higher level of CRP, and two other PAE metabolites mono-carboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP) and mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) were positively associated with IL-6. The positive associations between PAEs and CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significant in the high-molecular-weight phthalate (HMWP) exposure group, not the low-molecular-weight phthalate (LMWP) exposure group. Exposure to OCPs was positively associated with CRP, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-10. No significant association was found between PCBs and inflammatory markers. These findings demonstrate that exposure to EDCs is closely linked to dysregulated inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted in the future to get a comprehensive view of the associations between different EDCs and inflammation, and investigations on the underlying mechanisms are needed.},

  abstract={Acquired platelet function disorders (PFD) are rare bleeding diseases that should be suspected in all patients with unexplained mucocutaneous bleedings of recent onset, with no previous history of haemorrhages, and with normal coagulation test and platelet count. Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrombasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet αIIbβ3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (aδSPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatment of the underlying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies.Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and aδSPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed. Although no guidelines are available for the management of these very rare conditions, presentation of all cases reported so far can help clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of these life-threatening diseases.},

AREAS COVERED: A systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, WHO COVID-19 database, including EMBASE, Scopus, WHO-COVID, LILACS, and Google Scholar to identify original articles published up to 31 July 2021. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence or proportion of antimicrobial consumption among COVID-19 patients. EXPERT OPINION: We identified 43 original articles, 33 studies from high-income countries, six from upper-middle-income countries, and four from lower-middle-income countries. Most of the studies presented data from hospital or secondary health-care settings (n = 34). Included studies measured antimicrobial consumption as Daily Defined Doses (DDD) or day of therapy (DOT) or percentage. A total of 19 studies measured antimicrobial consumption as DDDs or DOT. Meta-analysis revealed an overall high antimicrobial consumption of 68% (95% CI: 60% to 75%). The subgroup analysis found a lower consumption in high-income countries (58%, 95% CI: 48% to 67%), compared with lower and middle-income countries (89%, 95% CI: 82% to 94%). High antimicrobial consumption found in COVID-19 patients demands implementation of appropriate antimicrobial stewardship interventions.},

  abstract={TOPIC: A variety of different tamponade agents are used with vitrectomy combined with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling for the treatment of idiopathic macular holes. These agents include air, gas (sulfur hexafluoride [SF(6)], hexafluoroethane [C(2)F(6)], and perfluoropropane [C(3)F(8)]), and silicone oil. The optimal tamponade agent is uncertain, and we aimed to review the effect of tamponade choice on hole closure and visual outcomes. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Although most surgeons initially chose to use long-acting gas (C(3)F(8)), there has been a gradual change in practice to the increasing use of the medium- (C(2)F(6)) and short-acting gases (SF(6)) or even air. However, there is no consensus regarding their relative efficacies. METHODS: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies comparing different tamponade agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy and ILM peeling for primary idiopathic macular holes. For RCTs, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, whereas for nonrandomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used. RESULTS: Thirteen publications, including 2 RCTs, were identified. Overall, there was no significant difference in the anatomic closure rates between studies using SF(6) compared with either C(3)F(8) or C(2)F(6) (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51-1.08). A subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher closure rate using SF(6) (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.30-0.79) in patients without postoperative posturing but not in those who were advised to posture facedown. The visual outcomes and adverse events were not significantly different. The comparisons of anatomic closure rates of patients treated with gas tamponade vs. silicone oil and with air vs. SF(6) showed no significant differences. The included studies had a number of methodological limitations and heterogeneities, making conclusions imprecise, with low or very low certainty by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. CONCLUSION: The current evidence base for tamponade selection with vitrectomy and ILM peeling for full-thickness macular hole has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals that have been linked to increased cholesterol levels and thus may have a role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). OBJECTIVES: To investigate associations between PFAS exposure and incident CVD (a combined CVD end-point consisting of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or heart failure) in two independent population-based cohorts in Sweden. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis also including results from previous studies. METHODS: In 2,278 subjects aged 45-75 years from the EpiHealth study, the risk of incident CVD in relation to relative plasma levels of perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was investigated. Associations between plasma levels of six PFAS and incident CVD were also examined in the PIVUS-study (n = 1,016, all aged 70 years). In addition, a meta-analysis was performed including three previous prospective studies, together with the results from the present study. RESULTS: There were no overall statistically significant associations between levels of the different PFAS and incident CVD, neither in EpiHealth nor in PIVUS. However, there was a significant sex interaction for PFOS in EpiHealth (p = 0.008), and an inverse association could be seen only in men (Men, HR: 0.68, 95 % CI: 0.52, 0.89) (Women, HR: 1.13, 95 % CI: 0.82, 1.55). A meta-analysis of five independent studies regarding PFOA and incident CVD showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.80 (CI: 0.66, 0.94) when high levels were compared to low levels. CONCLUSIONS: This longitudinal study using data from two population-based cohort studies in Sweden did not indicate any increased risk of incident CVD for moderately elevated PFAS levels. A meta-analysis of five independent cohort studies rather indicated a modest inverse association between PFOA levels and incident CVD, further supporting that increasing PFAS levels are not linked to an increased risk of CVD.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Both Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA) and Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) are accepted surgical options for end-stage isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of PFA and TKA by evaluation of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). METHODS: We systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Meta-analysis software was used to screen for potential articles with at least two years' follow-up. Data were extracted and analysed for all PROMs operating time, postoperative inpatient time, complications and cost. We included five studies in our cumulative meta-analysis and reviewed them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used random-effect models. RESULTS: No significant difference was found between both TKA and PFA in the context of operating time. No significant difference after five years' follow-up was found between the two treatment options in terms of UCLA score and patient satisfaction. PFA showed significant improvement in WOMAC score at five-year follow-up, less postoperative inpatient time, better cost-effectiveness and significantly less blood loss. CONCLUSION: PFA seems to be a viable alternative to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. PFA showed less postoperative inpatient time and blood loss with similar PROMs to the TKA. Moreover, it is an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is widely used throughout different industries, including the food industry, because it is resistant to heat and prevents water or oil from easily permeating into or contaminating materials coated by PFOA. Although many studies have reported an association between PFOA exposure and the risk of developing hepatic diseases, it is still in debate because they have shown conflicting results. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the relationship between PFOA exposure and hepatic diseases. METHODS: This study searched studies related to hepatic diseases due to PFOA exposure until 31 December 2021, using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through research question development, literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation. This study found 8280 studies after excluding duplicate literature and selected 5 studies in the final stage. Among them, two studies were included in the meta-analysis. RESULTS: The results of the meta-analysis showed that the ALT of people exposed to PFOA was 117% higher than the ALT of those not exposed to PFOA, and it was significantly different (OR = 1.167; 95% CI, 1.086-1.254). CONCLUSION: However, since the number of studies included in the analysis was not large enough to conclude that PFOA exposure was associated with the development of hepatic diseases, more observational studies are needed to confirm its long-term effects.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are intentionally produced persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are resistant to environmental degradation. Previous in-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that POPs can induce oxidative stress, which is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. However, findings in epidemiological studies are inconsistent and an evidence synthesis study is lacking to summarize the existing literature and explore research gaps. OBJECTIVE: We evaluated the effects of PFAS, PCBs, OCPs, and PBDEs, on oxidative stress biomarkers in epidemiological studies. METHODS: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify all published studies related to POPs and oxidative stress up to December 7(th), 2022. We included human observational studies reporting at least one exposure to POPs and an oxidative stress biomarker of interest. Random-effects meta-analyses on standardized regression coefficients and effect direction plots with one-tailed sign tests were used for quantitative synthesis. RESULTS: We identified 33 studies on OCPs, 35 on PCBs, 49 on PFAS, and 12 on PBDEs. Meta-analyses revealed significant positive associations of α-HCH with protein carbonyls (0.035 [0.017, 0.054]) and of 4'4-DDE with malondialdehyde (0.121 [0.056, 0.187]), as well as a significant negative association between 2'4-DDE and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (-0.042 [-0.079, -0.004]), all β [95%CI]. Sign tests showed a significant positive association between PCBs and malondialdehyde (p(one-tailed) = 0.03). Additionally, we found significant negative associations of OCPs with acetylcholine esterase (p(one-tailed) = 0.02) and paraoxonase-1 (p(one-tailed) = 0.03). However, there were inconsistent associations of OCPs with superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. CONCLUSIONS: Higher levels of OCPs were associated with increased levels of oxidative stress through increased pro-oxidant biomarkers involving protein oxidation, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation, as well as decreased TAC. These findings have the potential to reveal the underlying mechanisms of POPs toxicity.},

  abstract={PURPOSE: Recent studies have suggested a lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The current study aimed to provide an updated and comprehensive assessment of the association between SSRI use and development of HCC. METHODS: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational studies published until June 2021. We comprehensively searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase to identify studies comparing SSRIs use with control in relation to the risk of HCC. We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between SSRI use and incident HCC risk using random-effects meta-analysis. A dose-response analysis was conducted to evaluate the HCC risk according to the defined daily dose (DDD) of SSRI use. RESULTS: Eight observational studies, comprising 1,051,096 participants and 22,316 incidences of HCC, examining the association between SSRIs use and HCC risk, were included in the systematic review (adjusted RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.56-0.79; P ≤ 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the magnitude of benefit associated with SSRIs was significantly higher in patients with hepatitis infection (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51-0.95) than the general population (P(heterogeneity) = 0.700). The dose-response analysis indicated strong inverse association between cumulative DDD of SSRI and risk of HCC (coefficient: - 0.0030; P = 0.002; R(2) = 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this review show that SSRI use was associated with a 34% lower risk of HCC, which tend to be dose dependent. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these observations across the spectrum of chronic liver disease and hepatitis infection.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. METHODS: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. RESULTS: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. CONCLUSIONS: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals.},

To identify a more precise relationship between them, a meta-analysis was performed. We searched Embase, the PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Ovid databases, and Web of Science databases (before March 2022) for appropriate studies on the correlations of PFAS exposure with semen parameters. We extracted β value and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to conduct meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses was performed by sample size, geographic location, and sample type. A total of seven articles involving 2190 participants were included in this study. The concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (β value =  - 1.38; 95% CI: - 2.44, - 0.32) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (β value =  - 1.31, 95% CI: - 2.35, - 0.26) were negatively associated with sperm progressive motility. Subgroup analysis revealed that PFNA exposure was related to sperm morphology in studies with the sample size exceeding 200 people (β value =  - 0.14; 95% CI: - 0.26, - 0.01). Our study supports that exposure to some PFASs (e.g., PFNA, PFOA) may be associated with semen quality, such as lower sperm progressive motility.

We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies comparing contemporary single- and dual-chamber ICD (VVI-/DDD-ICD) versus VDD-ICD were included. Restricted maximum likelihood method for random effect model and Mantel-Haenszel method for fixed effect model were used to estimate the effect size of new-onset AHREs, or SCAF detection in each group. Three prospective studies were identified and total of 991 participants were included. There were 330 (33.3%) in VDD-ICD and 661 (66.7%) in VVI-/DDD-ICD. Most (78%) participants were men. Median follow-up was from 365 days to 847 days. VDD-ICD has a higher likelihood of detecting AHREs or SCAF as compared to VVI-/DDD-ICD [(OR random effect : 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.8; p = .018); I-squared = 67.8%, p = .019]. This difference was more apparently seen in the comparison between VDD-ICD and VVI-ICD [(OR random effect: 3.8; 95% CI: 2.1, 6.6, p < .001), I-squared = 0.0%, p = .518]. The result is same as fixed effect. Rate of AHREs detection observed in VDD-ICD was not statistically different when compared to the only group with DDD-ICD from SENSE trial. In conclusion, this meta-analysis reveals that the use of floating atrial sensing dipole in VDD-ICD increases the detection of new-onset AHREs or SCAF when compared to VVI-ICD, with similar atrial sensing performance to DDD-ICD.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: Due to their high worldwide prevalence, pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFD's) are a public health problem. There is high heterogeneity in the types and effectiveness of conservative treatment. The objective was to analyze the scientific evidence on conservative treatment of PFDs in women. METHODS: Umbrella review, covering MEDLINE (1950-2019), Scopus (1960-2019), Web of Science (1980-2019), and Cochrane Library (2000-2019). Inclusion criterion: review on conservative treatments about pelvic floor disorders in the adult women, in Spanish or English; exclusion criterion: studies about other urological, gynecological, and coloproctological pathologies, among others. RESULTS: Thirty-two reviews (2000-2019) and 12 meta-analyses were included. 53.1% showed an improvement on urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training worked on 70.6% of them, followed by electrical stimulation and estrogen (11.7%), and weight loss (5.9%). 6.3% of reviews and meta-analyses fulfilled all items in PRISMA, and 93.7% of them fulfilled more than 60% of the checklist. 60% de los ítems. CONCLUSIONS: PFMT and weight loss are the most effective treatments for UI, but there is no evidence for other PFDs.

  abstract={Accelerating evidence confirms the contribution of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to disease burden and disability across the lifespan. Given that policy makers raise the high cost of remediation and of substituting PFAS with safer alternatives in consumer products as barriers to confronting adverse health outcomes associated with PFAS exposure, it is important to document the costs of inaction even in the presence of uncertainty. We therefore quantified disease burdens and related economic costs due to legacy PFAS exposures in the US in 2018. We leveraged systematic reviews and used meta-analytic inputs whenever possible, identified previously published exposure-response relationships, and calculated PFOA- and PFOS-attributable increases in 13 conditions. These increments were then applied to census data to determine total annual PFOA- and PFOS-attributable cases of disease, from which we calculated economic costs due to medical care and lost productivity using previously published cost-of-illness data. We identified PFAS-attributable disease costs in the US of $5.52 billion across five primary disease endpoints shown to be associated with PFAS exposure in meta-analyses. This estimate represented the lower bound, with sensitivity analyses revealing as much as $62.6 billion in overall costs. While further work is needed to assess probability of causation and establish with greater certainty effects of the broader category of PFAS, the results confirm further that public health and policy interventions are still necessary to reduce exposure to PFOA and PFOS and their endocrine-disrupting effects. This study demonstrates the large potential economic implications of regulatory inaction.

  abstract={Low birthweight (LBW) is a worldwide public health concern, while the global burden of LBW attributable to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), has not yet been evaluated. Here, we established a large dataset for the biomonitoring of seven representative congeners of PFAS by examining data from 2325 publications. Global exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the highest, followed by perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Spatiotemporal exposure to PFAS varied considerably, with daily intake estimated in the range of 0.01-1.7 ng/kg/day. Moreover, decreasing trends in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA exposure were noted in most regions of the world over the past two decades, but such trends were not observed for other PFAS with long carbon chains, especially in East Asia. Furthermore, we estimated that human exposure to PFOA contributed to approximately 461,635 (95% confidence interval: 57,418 to 854,645) cases per year of LBW during the past two decades, predominantly from Asian regions. Although our estimation may be constrained by uncertainties from the dose-response curve and data availability, this study has unveiled that PFAS might be a contributor to global LBW prevalence during 2000-2019, supporting continuous actions to mitigate PFAS contamination.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: A major driver of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and poor clinical outcomes is suboptimal antibiotic use, although data are lacking in low-resource settings. We reviewed studies on systemic antibiotic use (WHO ATC/DDD category J01) for human health in Indonesia, and synthesized available evidence to identify opportunities for intervention. METHODS: We systematically searched five international and national databases for eligible peer-reviewed articles, in English and Indonesian, published between 1 January 2000 and 1 June 2021 including: (1) antibiotic consumption; (2) prescribing appropriateness; (3) antimicrobial stewardship (AMS); (4) consumers' and providers' perceptions. Two independent reviewers included studies and extracted data. Study-level data were summarized using random-effects model meta-analysis for consumption and prescribing appropriateness, effect direction analysis for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions, and qualitative synthesis for perception surveys. (PROSPERO: CRD42019134641). FINDINGS: Of 9323 search hits, we included 100 reports on antibiotic consumption (20), prescribing appropriateness (49), AMS interventions (13), and/or perception (25) (8 categorized in >1 domain). The pooled estimate of overall antibiotic consumption was 134.8 DDD per 100 bed-days (95%CI 82.5-187.0) for inpatients and 121.1 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (10.4-231.8) for outpatients. Ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and ampicillin were the most consumed antibiotics in inpatients, and amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and cefadroxil in outpatients. Pooled estimates for overall appropriate prescribing (according to Gyssens method) were 33.5% (18.1-53.4) in hospitals and 49.4% (23.7-75.4) in primary care. Pooled estimates for appropriate prescribing (according to reference guidelines) were, in hospitals, 99.7% (97.4-100) for indication, 84.9% (38.5-98.0) for drug choice, and 6.1% (0.2-63.2) for overall appropriateness, and, in primary care, 98.9% (60.9-100) for indication, 82.6% (50.5-95.7) for drug choice and 10.5% (0.8-62.6) for overall appropriateness. Studies to date evaluating bundled AMS interventions, although sparse and heterogeneous, suggested favourable effects on antibiotic consumption, prescribing appropriateness, guideline compliance, and patient outcomes. Key themes identified in perception surveys were lack of community antibiotic knowledge, and common non-prescription antibiotic self-medication. INTERPRETATION: Context-specific intervention strategies are urgently needed to improve appropriate antibiotic use in Indonesian hospitals and communities, with critical evidence gaps concerning the private and informal healthcare sectors.

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) constitute a heterogeneous group of synthetic compounds widely used in industrial applications. The estimation of PFAS half-life (t(1/2)) is essential to quantify their persistence, their toxicity and mechanism of action in humans. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence on PFAS half-lives in humans from the available literature, and to investigate the limitations and uncertainties characterizing half-life estimation. METHODS: The search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases up to July 03, 2023 and was aimed at identifying all papers that estimated PFAS half-life in human populations. We excluded studies on temporal trends or providing estimates of half-life based solely on renal clearance. As persistent and ongoing exposures can influence half-life estimation, we decided to include only studies that were conducted after the main source of exposure to PFAS had ceased. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on studies that reported perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) or perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) half-life estimation. Risk of bias was evaluated using the OHAT tool. RESULTS: A total of 13 articles were included in the review, with 5 studies conducted in exposed general populations and 8 studies conducted in exposed workers; the estimated mean half-life ranged from 1.48 to 5.1 years for PFOA, from 3.4 to 5.7 years for total PFOS, and from 2.84 to 8.5 years for PFHxS. High heterogeneity among studies was observed; potential reasons include the variability among the investigated populations, discrepancies in considering ongoing exposures, variability in PFAS isomeric compositions, accounting for background exposure, time since exposure stopped and methods used for half-life estimation. DISCUSSION: Despite the efforts made to better understand PFAS toxicokinetics, further studies are needed to identify important characteristics of these persistent chemicals. Biomonitoring studies should focus on persistent and unaccounted sources of exposure to PFAS and on individual characteristics potentially determining half-life, to ensure accurate estimates.},

  abstract={In rural areas of the United States, an estimated ~1.8 million people lack reliable access to safe drinking water. Considering the relative dearth of information on water contamination and health outcomes in Appalachia, we conducted a systematic review of studies of microbiological and chemical drinking water contamination and associated health outcomes in rural Appalachia. We pre-registered our protocols, limiting eligibility to primary data studies published from 2000 to 2019, and searched four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library). We used qualitative syntheses, meta-analyses, risk of bias analysis, and meta-regression to assess reported findings, with reference to US EPA drinking water standards. Of the 3452 records identified for screening, 85 met our eligibility criteria. 93 % of eligible studies (n = 79) used cross-sectional designs. Most studies were conducted in Northern (32 %, n = 27) and North Central (24 %, n = 20) Appalachia, and only 6 % (n = 5) were conducted exclusively in Central Appalachia. Across studies, E. coli were detected in 10.6 % of samples (sample-size-weighted mean percentage from 4671 samples, 14 publications). Among chemical contaminants, sample-size-weighted mean concentrations for arsenic were 0.010 mg/L (n = 21,262 samples, 6 publications), and 0.009 mg/L for lead (n = 23,259, 5 publications). 32 % (n = 27) of studies assessed health outcomes, but only 4.7 % (n = 4) used case-control or cohort designs (all others were cross-sectional). The most commonly reported outcomes were detection of PFAS in blood serum (n = 13), gastrointestinal illness (n = 5), and cardiovascular-related outcomes (n = 4). Of the 27 studies that assessed health outcomes, 62.9 % (n = 17) appeared to be associated with water contamination events that had received national media attention. Overall, based on the number and quality of eligible studies identified, we could not reach clear conclusions about the state of water quality, or its impacts on health, in any of Appalachia's subregions. More epidemiologic research is needed to understand contaminated water sources, exposures, and potentially associated health outcomes in Appalachia.},

  abstract={INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are helpful instruments when measuring and reporting changes in patient health status (Al Sayah et al. J Patient Rep Outcomes 5 (Suppl 2):99, 2021) such as the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The Australasian Pelvic Floor Procedure Registry (APFPR) aims to increase capacity for women to report surgical outcomes through the collection of HrQoL data (Ruseckaite et al. Qual Life Res. 2021) but currently lacks a pain-specific PROM for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), particularly POP and SUI. This review aims to systematically review the existing literature and identify instruments that measure pain in women with POP and SUI for inclusion within the APFPR, which reports on complications from these conditions. METHODS: We conducted a literature search on OVID MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMCARE databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies from inception to April 2021. Full-text studies were included if they used PROMs to measure pain in women with POP and SUI. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. RESULTS: From 2001 studies, 23 publications describing 19 different PROMs were included for analysis. Eight of these instruments were specific to the pelvic floor; four were only specific to pain and used across multiple disorders; three were generic quality of life instruments and four were other non-validated instruments such as focus group interviews. These instruments were not specific to pain in women with POP or SUI, as they did not identify all relevant domains such as the sensation, region and duration of pain, or incidents where onset of pain occurs. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this review suggest there are no current PROMs that are suitable pain-specific instruments for women with POP or SUI. This knowledge may inform and assist in the development of a new PROM to be implemented into the APFPR.},

  abstract={Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, -0.022; 95% CI, -0.04 to -0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, -0.017; 95% CI, -0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level. In conclusion, prenatal exposure to organochlorine and PFAS may be associated with lower neonatal TT4 level.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Existing evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure might contribute to the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. METHODS: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. RESULTS: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02-1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86-1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86-1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55-1.16) respectively. CONCLUSION: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health. Further studies are needed in order to establish causality and clarify the potential mechanism.},

  abstract={Exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), ubiquitous persistent environmental contaminants, has led to substantial global concern due to their potential environmental and human health effects. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Internal fixation with cephalomedullary nails has been widely used in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures (IFF). Yet, the difference in efficacy and safety between the commonly used integrated dual-screw cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) and single-screw cephalomedullary nail remains inconclusive. Thus we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies comparing InterTAN with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), the Asian PFNA (PFNA-II), or the Gamma3 nail in treating IFF were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from inception to April 30, 2023. The differences in perioperative parameters and clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated by mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The risks of various complications and mortality were assessed by risk ratio (RR) with 95%CI. RESULTS: Twenty-three studies comprising 3566 patients were included. Compared with single-screw cephalomedullary nails (PFNA/PFNA-II, Gamma3), InterTAN conferred significantly reduced risk of implant failures (RR = 0.37, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.51, P < 0.001), hip and thigh pain (RR = 0.70, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.90, P = 0.006) and all-cause revision/reoperation (RR = 0.38, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.57, P < 0.001). Moreover, patients treated with InterTAN had significantly higher 1-year Harris Hip Score (MD = 0.82, 95%CI 0.20-1.44, P = 0.010) and shorter time to union/healing (MD = - 0.66 days, 95%CI  - 1.16 to  - 0.16, P = 0.009). Femoral neck shortening, time to full bearing, and incidences of non-union, infection, deep venous thrombosis, and mortality were comparable between both groups. CONCLUSIONS: The integrated dual-screw InterTAN construct has superior performance in reducing risks of complications and improving clinical and functional outcomes in the treatment of IFF. More well-designed, high-quality RCTs are warranted to confirm these findings.},

  abstract={Emerging pollutants (EPs) are causative for teratogenic and reproductive effects. EPs are detected in all the environmental matrices at higher levels. A suitable model for aquatic toxicity assessment is Hydra, because of morphological, behavioral, reproductive (sexual and asexual), and biochemical changes. Many researchers have used Hydra for toxicity assessment of organic chemicals (BPA), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials and microplastics. Various Hydra species were used for environmental toxicity studies; however H. magnipapillata was predominantly used due to the availability of its genome and proteome sequences. Teratogenic and reproductive changes in Hydra are species specific. Teratogenic effects were studied using sterozoom dissecting microscope, acridine orange (AO) and 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DPAI) staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by EPs had been understood by the Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFDA) staining and comet assay. Multiple advanced techniques would aid to understand the effects at molecular level, such as real-time PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA end- PCR. EPs modulated the major antioxidant enzyme levels, therefore, defense mechanism was affected by the higher generation of reactive oxygen species. Genome sequencing helps to know the mode of action of pollutants, role of enzymes in detoxification, defense genes and stress responsive genes. Molecular techniques were used to obtain the information for evolutionary changes of genes and modulation of gene expression by EPs.},

  abstract={The potential adverse effects of UV-filter pollution in marine environments have been the focus of research in recent years. This systematic review aims to determine the extent of this emerging problem, both quantitatively and qualitatively, combining temporal and science mapping analyses to explore the development of the field of UV-filters in the marine environment (from 1990 to 2021), and to outline new research frontiers. The temporal trend analysis revealed an exponential growth of published studies over the last decade (70% since 2016), confirming the emerging role of this topic in environmental science. The meta-analysis determined that 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) are top-priority environmental pollutants due to their increasing usage and, in turn, a frequent occurrence in marine ecosystems. This meta-analysis determined the focus on these two contaminants for this review. A critical discussion of the applications, regulatory aspects, and environmental occurrences of these selected compounds was provided. The present study also focused on the most recent (2015-2021) field and laboratory studies investigating the ecotoxicological impacts of 4-MBC and BP-3 on marine invertebrates. This review highlights the need for more research efforts to fill the knowledge gaps on the realistic effects these compounds may have when considered individually, in combination, or as subsequent exposures. Overall, this review aims to establish guidelines for further studies to understand the effect of UV-filters on marine ecosystems and marine invertebrate communities.},

  abstract={We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and childhood obesity. We focused on organochlorines (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB], and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are the POPs more widely studied in environmental birth cohorts so far. We search two databases (PubMed and Embase) through July/09/2021 and identified 33 studies reporting associations with prenatal organochlorine exposure, 21 studies reporting associations with prenatal PFAS, and five studies reporting associations with prenatal PBDEs. We conducted a qualitative review. Additionally, we performed random-effects meta-analyses of POP exposures, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and BMI-z. Prenatal DDE and HCB levels were associated with higher BMI z-score in childhood (beta: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21; I(2) : 28.1% per study-specific log increase of DDE and beta: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.53; I(2) : 31.9% per study-specific log increase of HCB). No significant associations between PCB-153, PFOA, PFOS, or pentaPBDEs with childhood BMI were found in meta-analyses. In individual studies, there was inconclusive evidence that POP levels were positively associated with other obesity indicators (e.g., waist circumference).},

  abstract={INTRODUCTION: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are potentially obesogenic for children. We undertook a systematic review to synthesize this literature and explore sources of heterogeneity in previously published epidemiological studies. METHODS: Studies that collected individual-level PFAS and anthropometric data from children up to 12 years of age were identified by searching six databases. We excluded studies that only evaluated obesity measures at the time of birth. A full-text review and quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) criteria. Forest plots were created to summarize measures of association and assess heterogeneity across studies by chemical type and exposure timing. Funnel plots were used to assess small-study effects. RESULTS: We identified 24 studies, of which 19 used a cohort design. There were 13 studies included in the meta-analysis examining various chemicals and outcomes. Overall prenatal exposures to four different types of PFAS were not statistically associated with changes in body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference. In contrast, for three chemicals, postnatal exposures were inversely related to changes in BMI (i.e., per log10 increase in PFOS: BMI z-score of -0.16 (95% CI: -0.22, -0.10)). There was no substantial heterogeneity in the reported measures of association within prenatal and postnatal subgroups. We observed modest small-study effects, but correction for these effects using the Trim and Fill method did not change our summary estimate(s). CONCLUSION: Our review found no evidence of a positive association between prenatal PFAS exposure and pediatric obesity, whereas an inverse association was found for postnatal exposure. These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of studies. Future research that can inform on the effects of exposure mixtures, the timing of the exposure, outcome measures, and the shape of the exposure-response curve is needed.},

  abstract={Background Neck of femur (NOF) fractures, including intertrochanteric fractures, are common fragility fractures seen in the elderly population and are often amenable to fixation with a proximal femoral nail (PFN). However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the incidence of peri-prosthetic fractures with each device. Several studies from the 1990s and a recent meta-analysis have shown a higher incidence of peri-prosthetic fractures in the short PFN cohort. Other studies have shown a lower reoperation rate with short PFNs, and no statistically significant differences have been quoted in the rates of peri-prosthetic fractures in systematic reviews. Aim The purpose of this retrospective study, therefore, was to assess the peri-prosthetic fracture rate and failure rates of elderly neck of femur (NOF) fractures implanted with either a short or long proximal femoral nail (PFN). Materials and methods A retrospective study was conducted in a single orthopaedic department (University Hospital Dorset, Poole, GBR) using collected data on all extracapsular neck of femur fracture patients from the national hip fracture database (NHFD) from January 1, 2011, to December 23, 2021. The data collected included patient age, sex, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) type of neck of femur fracture, type of surgery performed, any further peri-prosthetic fractures, and time to re-operation in that subset of the group. The implants used were the Stryker Gamma 3 Nail and the Smith Nephew (Trigen and Intertan). All patients were allowed to fully weight bear as tolerated and received both orthopaedic and elderly medical care. Failure was defined as a cut-out or implant fracture. Results From January 1, 2011, to December 23, 2021, there were 1010 extracapsular neck of femur fractures recorded on the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) treated with a PFN from the study centre. Of those patients, 11 had pathological fractures and were excluded. 649 patients had long PFNs, and 350 had short PFNs. Of the total of 999 patients, 254 (25%) were male and 745 (75%) were female. More than 80% of the patients in the sample were over the age of 75. The majority of patients in both groups had A1/A2 fractures (short 84.3%, long 49.1%). The rate of periprosthetic fractures in the short PFNs was 1.71%, and the failure rate was 0.57%. The rate of periprosthetic fractures in the long PFNs was 0.62%, with a failure rate of 0.92%. The multi-nominal logistic regression model did not show statistically significant odds ratios (OR) for the following variables: long/short nails, male/female gender, age, ASA, or type of fracture. The female gender was associated with a higher risk of both periprosthetic fractures and failures (OR of 2.232 and 2.95), but this was not found to be statistically significant. Similarly, unstable A3 fractures had a much higher risk of failure (OR of 2.691) compared to periprosthetic fractures (OR of 0.985). However, this was not statistically significant. Conclusion Overall, this study has identified that in a patient population that is predominantly female and over the age of 75, the risk of periprosthetic fracture rate and the failure rate is similar in both the use of a short or a long PFN for intertrochanteric fractures.},

Data on study design, patient demographics, pre- and post-procedure Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and complications were extracted. Inclusion criteria focused on adult patients with degenerative spinal diseases treated with cement discoplasty. The overall effect size was evaluated using a forest plot, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I(2) statistic and chi-squared test. RESULTS: The search strategy yielded six studies, which included 336 patients (73.8% female, 26.2% male) with a mean average age of 74.6 years. VAS scores were reported in all studies, showing a significant difference between pre- and post-PCD pain scores (Weighted Mean Difference [WMD]: -3.45; 95% CI: -3.83, -3.08; I(2) = 15%; P < .001). ODI scores were reported in 83% of studies, with a significant difference between pre- and post-PCD scores (WMD: -22.22; 95% CI: -25.54, -18.89; I(2) = 61%; p < .001). Complications reported included infections, thrombophlebitis, vertebral fractures, disc extrusion, and the need for further operations. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis showed clinically significant improvements in pain and functional disability based on VAS and ODI scores. However, due to methodological limitations and a high risk of bias, the validity and generalizability of the findings are uncertain. Despite these issues, the results provide preliminary insights into PCD's potential efficacy and can guide future research to address current limitations.},

  abstract={Insulin infusion sets (IISs) are an integral and intricate part of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for subjects with type 1 diabetes, infusing insulin from pump to the subcutaneous space. Insulin infusion sets interface with the skin surface, the dermis, and the subcutaneous space and may be the cause of infusion failure due to biological events or mechanical problems. Novel IISs with extended wear time and anti-inflammatory properties to mitigate these issues are described in the literature although material-tissue interactions are poorly understood. This rapid review focuses on the impact of IIS materials and designs on the subcutaneous response in people with diabetes and includes literature identified in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Twenty-one studies were identified for qualitative synthesis that encompassed a limited and heterogenic body of evidence including 10 clinical reports, six reviews, one case report, two abstracts, and two communications. Two clinical reports were randomized crossover studies. Reports on materials mostly compared steel versus polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) cannulas and suggested no substantial difference in tissue response to these materials. Reports on designs focused mostly on the angle of cannula insertion. To drive and improve research on extended wear and nonimmunogenic IISs, future studies should focus on material-tissue interaction as dedicated outcome measures, quantified with punch biopsy and imaging techniques such as ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and confocal reflectance microscopy. Original studies are required to further a field too young for a systematic meta-analysis.},

  abstract={Maternal endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exposure, the common environmental pollutants, was capable of involving in adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the evidence of their connection is not consistent. Our goal was to comprehensively explore the risk of EDCs related to adverse pregnancy outcomes. One hundred and one studies were included from two databases before 2023 to explore the association between EDCs and adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB). We found that maternal PFASs exposure was positively correlated with PTB (OR:1.13, 95% CI:1.04-1.23), SGA (OR:1.10, 95% CI:1.04-1.16) and miscarriage (OR:1.09, 95% CI:1.00-1.19). The pooled estimates also showed maternal PAEs exposure was linked with PTB (OR:1.16, 95% CI:1.11-1.21), SGA (OR:1.20, 95% CI:1.07-1.35) and miscarriage (OR:1.55, 95% CI:1.33-1.81). In addition, maternal exposure to some specific class of EDCs including PFOS, MBP, MEHP, DEHP, and BPA was associated with PTB. Maternal exposure to PFOS, PFOA, PFHpA was associated with SGA. Maternal exposure to BPA was associated with LBW. Maternal exposure to MMP, MEHP, MEHHP, MEOHP, BPA was associated with miscarriage. Maternal PFASs, PAEs and BPA exposure may increase adverse pregnancy outcomes risk according to our study. However, the limited number of studies on dose-response hampered further explanation for causal association.},

  abstract={Seventy percent of women with pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) are estimated to present deficient consciousness of their pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) and poor ability to contract them. Improving the proprioception of PFMs, defined as the capacity to know the status and position of each body part, and adequately contracting them could be a protective factor to prevent the appearance of PFDs in the general female population. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of educational interventions and verbal instructions on how to contract and exercise the PFMs to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women. A systematic search of studies published in the last 20 years until March 2022 was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, Lilacs, and Dialnet databases. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity in the types of studies and included populations. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for the design, search, and reporting of studies. The methodological quality was analysed via the PEDro and the Newcastle-Ottawa scales in the case of randomised clinical trials and non-randomised studies, respectively, while the quality of evidence was determined using the SIGN grading system for evidence-based guidelines. Descriptive and experimental studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that evaluated the contractile capability of the PFMs in healthy women or women without a previous diagnosis of PFD were included. Seven articles that included a total of 2507 women were found, three of which were clinical trials with PEDro scores between 5 and 9 points out of 10 and four of which were non-randomised studies with NOS scores between 6 and 8 points out of 10. The outcomes were measured through vaginal palpation, visual observation, questionnaires for PFD symptoms, and self-perception reports. This review discriminated between two types of intervention, educational programmes and verbal instructions, and evaluated the changes observed in PFM strength and knowledgeability and the symptoms of PFDs. The findings showed that educational interventions and verbal instructions improve the proprioception of PFMs in women of all ages that are healthy or without a previous diagnosis of PFDs as well as their knowledge about the pelvic floor, healthy lifestyle habits, and symptoms that are potentially indicative of PFDs. Further high-quality randomised clinical trials are warranted to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of educational interventions to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women considered healthy or with mild symptoms that may be indicative of PFDs.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals. Previous evidence suggests that exposure to PFAS is associated with reproductive hormone levels, but the results of relevant studies are inconsistent. The objective of our study is to determine the association between exposure to PFAS and reproductive hormone levels in gender-specific general population. METHOD: Based on scientific search strategies, we systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, and Scopus to obtain the eligible studies published before January 21, 2023. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Risk of Bias tool. We combined the β coefficient and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Stata.17 with random-effect model or fixed-effect model. We also performed subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and Begger's and Egger's tests. RESULTS: Eleven studies involving 7714 participants were included. Meta-analysis showed that PFHxS exposure was positively associated with estradiol (E2) levels in female [β = 0.030, 95% CI: (0.013, 0.046), P = 0.000]. A negative association was found between PFOA [β = -0.012, 95% CI: (-0.023, -0.002), P = 0.017] and PFOS [β = -0.011; 95% CI: (-0.021, -0.000), P = 0.042] exposure with male testosterone (TT) levels. In the subgroup analysis, there were stronger associations in children than in adults. And the high heterogeneity was mainly due to the cross-sectional studies. Publication bias was not found in most of the analyses. CONCLUSION: Our study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with reproductive hormone levels. Further related studies are needed to identify the association and potential mechanism in the future.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are widely found in the environment, can disrupt endocrine homeostasis when they enter the human body. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate current human epidemiological evidence on the relationship between PFAS exposure and glucolipid metabolism in childhood and adolescence. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases, and identified population-based epidemiological studies related to PFAS and glucolipid metabolism indexes that were published before 30 December 2022. The heterogeneity of the included literature was assessed using the I-square (I(2)) test and statistics Q. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to combine the effect size. Subgroup analysis based on age and sex of the study participants was performed. A sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the robustness and reliability of the combined results. Egger's and Begg's tests were used to analyze publication bias. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies were included in this analysis. There was a positive association between PFAS and TC (β = 1.110, 95% CI: 0.601, 1.610) and LDL (β = 1.900, 95% CI: 1.030, 2.770), and a negative association between PFAS and HOMA-IR in children and adolescents (β = -0.130, 95% CI: -0. 200, -0.059). PFOS was significant positive associated with TC (β = 8.22, 95% CI: 3.93, 12.51), LDL (β = (12.04, 95% CI: 5.08, 18.99), and HOMA-IR (β = -0.165, 95% CI: -0.292, -0.038). Subgroup analysis showed that exposure to PFAS in the adolescent group was positively associated with TC and LDL levels, and the relationship was stronger in females. CONCLUSION: PFAS exposure is associated with glucolipid metabolism in children and adolescents. Among them, PFOS may play an important role. Recognition of environmental PFAS exposure is critical for stabilizing the glycolipid metabolism relationship during the growth and development of children and adolescents.},

OBJECTIVE: We aimed to review the surgical outcomes between air and gas tamponade after vitrectomy for RRD. METHOD: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were reviewed. The study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42022342284). The primary outcome was the primary anatomical success after vitrectomy. The secondary outcome was the prevalence of postoperative ocular hypertension. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. RESULTS: Ten studies involving 2,677 eyes were included. One study was randomized, and the others were non-randomized. The primary anatomical success after vitrectomy was not significantly different between the air and gas groups (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.48). The risk of ocular hypertension was significantly lower in the air group (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.09-0.24). The certainty of evidence regarding air tamponade having a comparable anatomical outcome and lower frequency of postoperative ocular hypertension in treatment of RRD were low. DISCUSSION: The current evidence base for tamponade selection in treatment of RRD has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND/AIM: This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of integrated dual lag screw (IDL) cephalomedullary nails (CMN) when compared with single lag screw (SL) constructs, in the internal fixation of intertrochanteric femoral fractures. METHODS: The Smith & Nephew InterTan IDL was compared with SL CMN group consisting of the Stryker Gamma-3 (G3) and Synthes Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) CMN. A multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies assessing the clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and perioperative parameters of InterTan versus G3 or PFNA CMN in patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were extracted and analysed. RESULTS: 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 2643 patients. InterTan was associated with lower complication rates in terms of all-cause revisions (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22-0.51; p < 0.001), cut-outs (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17-0.51; p < 0.001), medial or lateral screw migration (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06-0.65; p = 0.008) as well as persistent hip and thigh pain (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47-0.90; p = 0.008). In terms of perioperative parameters, InterTan is associated with longer operative times (MD 5.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.37-10.78 minutes, p = 0.04) and fluoroscopy times (MD 38.89 seconds, 95% CI, 15.88-61.91 seconds; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of clinical Harris Hip Score and radiological outcomes, non-union, haematoma, femoral fractures, varus collapse, length of stay and mean intraoperative blood loss between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Integrated dual lag screw cephalomedullary nails are associated with fewer revisions and complications. However, there is insufficient data to suggest that either nail construct is associated with better functional outcomes.},

  abstract={Purpose: Assess whether children with developmental defects of enamel (DDE) in primary teeth have a higher risk of having dental caries or a higher prevalence of clinical consequences due to the disease than those without DDE. Methods: Search was performed in PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science™, Cochrane Library, LILACS, BBO, Embase databases and in gray literature. Three independent reviewers were involved in study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. Risk of bias was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. DDE and its subtypes (demarcated opacities, hypoplasia, hypomineralized second primary molars (HSPM), and fluorosis) were regarded as exposure. Dental caries and clinical consequences of untreated caries were also assessed. In the meta-analyses, odds ratio (OR) was used in the random effects model for dichotomous outcomes. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: The search yielded 5,750 studies, 39 of which were included in the systematic review and 20 in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias ranged from 4 to 9 points. Children with DDE were more prone to primary tooth caries (OR=2.79; 95% CI:1.29-6.03), and so were those with demarcated opacities (OR=1.75; 95% CI:1.09-2.78), hypoplasia (OR=2.84; 95% CI:1.73-4.67), and HSPM (OR=2.89; 95% CI:1.65-5.06). Fluorosis was not associated with caries (OR=1.39; 95% CI:0.97-1.98). Regarding tooth as a unit of analysis, DDE was highly associated with caries (OR=2.34; 95% CI:1.74-3.16). As for the clinical consequences of caries, only the qualitative analysis was conducted and there was no consensus in the studies. Conclusion: DDE is associated with higher primary tooth caries experience.}

  abstract={Plastic microfibers (PMFs) are emerging pollutants widely distributed in the environment. In the early 2020s, the need for personal protection due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased consumption of plastic materials (e.g., facemasks and gloves) and ultimately to increased plastic pollution, especially by PMFs. The PMFs present in the environment may be released in this form (primary particles) or in larger materials, that will release them as a result of environmental conditions. Although a considerable number of studies have been addressing the effects of microplastics, most of them studied round particles, with fewer studies focusing on PMFs. Thus, the current study aimed to summarize and critically discuss the available data concerning the ecotoxicological impact of PMFs on aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms exposed to PMFs showed accumulation, mainly in the digestive tract, and several toxic effects, such as DNA damage, physiological alterations, digestive damage and even mortality, suggesting that PMFs can pose a risk for the health of aquatic organisms. The PMFs induced toxicity to aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate organisms depends on size, shape, chemical association and composition of fibers. Regarding other size range (nm) of plastic fibers, the literature review highlighted a knowledge gap in terms of the effects of plastic nanofibers on aquatic organisms. There is a knowledge gap in terms of the interaction and modes of action of PMFs associated with other pollutants. In addition, studies addressing effects at different trophic levels as well as the use of other biological models should be considered. Overall, research gaps and recommendations for future research and trends considering the environmental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: This study aimed to systematically analyze the relationship between preterm (PT), low birth weight (LBW), and developmental defects of enamel (DDE) in the primary dentition. METHODS: Following the retrieval of the databases, case-control studies, cross-sectional studies, and cohort studies on the relationship between PT, LBW and DDE, which had been published in English or Chinese up to January 2022 were included. The data about odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were extracted and calculated using STATA 12.0 Software. Case-control studies were evaluated using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS), while cross-sectional studies and cohort studies were evaluated using the JBI scale. The heterogeneity of each study was evaluated using the Q test. RESULTS: A total of 15 studies were included, of which 8 studied the relationship between PT and DDE, and 13 explored the relationship between LBW and DDE including three about the relationship between very low birth weight (VLBW) and DDE. Seven studies explored the relationship between PT, LBW, and DDE. The results of this meta-analysis showed that both PT and LBW especially VLBW (OR( )= 7.19, 95% CI: 4.98-10.38) were risk factors for DDE in the primary dentition (OR( )= 2.33, 95% CI: 1.55-3.51) (OR( )= 1.67, 95% CI: 1.08-2.59). The subgroup results showed that PT and LBW were both associated with the occurrence of enamel hypoplasia (EHP) (OR( )= 6.89, 95% CI: 3.33-14.34; OR( )= 2.78, 95% CI: 2.10-3.68) rather than enamel opacity (OR( )= 0.94, 95% CI: 0.55-1.61; OR( )= 1.03, 95% CI: 0.66-1.61). There was no publication bias about the included studies (P = 0.75 > 0.05; P = 0.47 > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This meta-analysis demonstrated that both PT and LBW especially VLBW are associated with a higher risk of DDE in the primary dentition. PT and LBW are both related to the occurrence of EHP. However, the relationship between PT, LBW, and enamel opacity has not been verified.

  abstract={BACKGROUND: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the status of Human Biomonitoring (HBM) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region and provide recommendations for future research, considering the increased environmental contaminants that pose a threat to human health in this rapidly industrializing area. METHODS: A thorough search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science databases up to February 2023 to identify biomonitoring studies on human exposure and levels in the GCC region. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility, conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The NIH Quality Assessment Tools and PRISMA guidelines were utilized for quality evaluation and reporting of results. RESULTS: A total of 38 eligible articles were included in this systematic review out of 662 articles screened. The majority of the publications were from Saudi Arabia (n = 24) and Kuwait (n = 10), while limited representation was found from Qatar (n = 3) and the UAE (n = 1). No articles were identified from Oman and Bahrain. The studies focused on metals, organohalogen compounds, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and phthalates. The findings revealed elevated levels of metals and established correlations between metal exposure and adverse health effects, including infant neurodevelopmental issues, vitamin D deficiency, and oxidative stress. The presence of organohalogen compounds and pesticides was prevalent in the GCC region, with significant associations between exposure to these compounds and negative health outcomes. Notably, high levels of perchlorate were observed in the Kuwaiti population, and a study from Saudi Arabia found an association between per- and polyfluorinated substances and increased odds of osteoporosis. CONCLUSIONS: This review emphasizes the need to address environmental health challenges in the GCC region through improved HBM research methods and strategies. Implementing biomonitoring programs, conducting cohort studies, investing in tools and expertise, promoting collaboration, and engaging the community are crucial for reliable HBM data in the GCC.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: The environment plays a key role in male infertility, changing the incidence in various populations, and pesticides are one of the most studied hazards. The use of the latter has never decreased, jeopardizing the safety of workers and the general population. OBJECTIVE: Our purpose was to summarize the results of studies discussing the association between pesticides and male fertility. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search was performed through MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Only human studies were considered. Semen parameters and DNA integrity were considered to evaluate the effect of pesticides on men. RESULTS: A total of 64 studies that investigated their impact in terms of semen parameters (51 studies) and chromatin and DNA integrity (25 studies) were included. The most frequently affected parameters were total sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology, although a reduction in ejaculate volume and concentration occur in several cases. A tangible worsening of semen quality was associated with organochlorines and organophosphates. Furthermore, pesticide exposure, especially pyrethroids, was related to a higher DNA fragmentation index and chromosome aneuploidy in most articles. CONCLUSION: The epidemiological evidence supports the association between pesticides and male fertility for workers and the exposed population in terms of semen quality, DNA fragmentation, and chromosome aneuploidy.},

  abstract={Despite increasing regulatory efforts to reduce production of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), continued human and ecological exposure to PFAS has led to concerns about historical releases. Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide important conduits between waste sources and the environment. We present a meta-analysis of results reported in 44 peer-reviewed publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples, collected from 21 countries, for which some or all of five perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were measured. Our meta analysis revealed global patterns and trends that, to our knowledge, have not been reported elsewhere. Regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the PFAS and the corresponding mean concentration for each country. Although legacy compounds, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have been reported with the highest measured concentrations, their global temporal trends are lowest of all PFAS considered. Concentrations of most PFAS analyzed in wastewater in the United States have not changed significantly with time, whereas reported PFAS concentrations in wastewater effluent from China have increased from 11% to 37% per year. In addition, our results show significant positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent concentrations of individual PFAS and the gross domestic product per capita of each country. Our analysis of this global data set also confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets: (i) none of the PFAS studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes; (ii) effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher PFAS concentrations; and (iii) the few studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) indicate that PFAS adsorbed to SPM can contribute significantly to the total PFAS load.},

  abstract={Chlorine dioxide (ClO(2)) has emerged as a broad-spectrum, safe, and effective disinfectant due to its high oxidation efficiency and reduced formation of organochlorinated by-products during application. This article provides an updated overview of ClO(2)-based oxidation processes used in water treatment. A systematic review of scientific information and experimental data on ClO(2)-based water purification procedures is presented. Concerning ClO(2)-based oxidation derivative problems, the pros and cons of ClO(2)-based combined processes are assessed and disinfection by-product (DBP) control approaches are proposed. The kinetic and mechanistic data on ClO(2) reactivity towards micropollutants are discussed. ClO(2) selectively reacts with electron-rich moieties (anilines, phenols, olefins, and amines) and eliminates certain inorganic ions and microorganisms with high efficiency. The formation of chlorite and chlorate during the oxidation process is a crucial concern when utilizing ClO(2). Future applications include the combination of ClO(2) with ferrous ions, activated carbon, ozone, UV, visible light, or persulfate processes. The combined process can reduce by-product generation while still ensuring ClO(2) sterilization and disinfection. Overall, this research could provide useful information and new insights into the application of ClO(2)-based technologies.},

  abstract={Filter feeding elasmobranchs may be considered as biological indicators of marine pollution, despite most of these species are under some degree of extinction risk. Among threats to this taxonomic group, marine pollution might represent an additional concern for their survival. In this review, a comprehensive systematic search of scientific literature on pollutants in filter feeding elasmobranchs was conducted to evaluate the bioaccumulation patterns, and risk for human consumers. We found that, despite an increasing trend in the number of published studies, the geographical coverage is still very limited and most of the studies focused solely on trace elements (70.8%). Among sharks, Rhincodon typus was the most represented species (66.7%), while Mobula mobular the most studied ray species (41.7%). Comparing the levels of pollutants in filter feeders between ocean basins, this review highlighted that Hg, As and Cd levels are mostly higher in those areas affected by both strong natural and anthropogenic source of emissions, such as the Indian Ocean. With regards to OCs, ΣPCB levels in muscle of C. maximus were between 4.3 and 50.5 μg kg(-1) ww, highlighting a persistent contamination of PCB in the Mediterranean Sea. Some species exceeded the maximum allowable limits for foodstuff consumption for As, Cd and Pb. A total of 77.8% of the analyzed species exceeded the Environmental Quality Standards for Hg, while they were always below the EQS(biota) for HCB, PBDEs, PFOS and DDT. Given their feeding mechanism that continuously samples the marine environment, further investigations are urgently needed to determine not only the extent of contaminant exposure in different hotspot locations but also the risks posed to the elasmobranch health.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common and devastating injuries, especially for the elderly. Surgical treatment is the optimal strategy for managing intertrochanteric fractures as it allows early rehabilitation and functional recovery. The relative effects of internal fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fracture after operation remain limited to relatively small studies which create uncertainty in attempts to establish evidence-based best practice. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the clinical effectiveness of two commonly used intramedullary devices: a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) versus a single-screw cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation) in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. The following outcomes were considered: revisions, implant-related failures, non-unions, pain, Harris hip score and intra-operative outcomes. Odds ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in brackets are reported. RESULTS: Six studies met the inclusion criteria: two randomised controlled trials and four observational studies enrolling 970 patients with a mean age of 77 years and 64% of patients being female. There was a statistically significant difference (p value < 0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13-0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09-0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34-0.74). There was no difference in non-unions and Harris hip score (p value > 0.05). There was a significant difference in blood loss and fluoroscopy usage in favour of PFNA, while no difference in operating times was observed between the two devices. CONCLUSIONS: Our meta-analysis suggests that a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) is clinically more effective when compared to a single-screw cephalomedullary nail proximal femoral nail antirotation resulting in fewer complications, fewer revisions and fewer patients complaining of pain. No difference has been established regarding non-unions and Harris hip score. Intra-operative outcomes favour PFNA with less blood loss and fluoroscopy usage. Further studies are warranted to explore the cost-effectiveness of these and other implants in managing patients with intertrochanteric fractures.},

  abstract={Humans are exposed every day to assorted environmental pollutants namely, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), organochlorine pesticides (OCP), brominated flame-retardants (BFR), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), synthetic musks, heavy metals (e.g. cadmium) and plastic additives (e.g. bisphenol A, BPA). Besides environmental persistence, biomagnification and bioaccumulative properties, these pollutants are classified as endocrine disruptors (EDs), metabolic disruptors, neurologic disruptors. These compounds affect the normal function of several mechanisms in the human body being linked to human health issues as cancer development (e.g. breast, uterine and endometrial), miscarriage, birth defects, premature delivery and infertility. In order to prevent future health issue of women and possible progeny, the assessment of EDs accumulated is essential, particularly in adipose tissue. These samples have been referred as the ideal matrix to establish over time accumulation and long-term exposure of persistent and non-persistent lipophilic EDs. However, the invasive sample collection procedure and methodology processing discourages the usage of this matrix for biomonitoring studies. In this review, a Web of Science search without any publishing year restriction on the analysis in adipose tissue of PCB, OCP, BPA, cadmium, BFR and synthetic musks was performed. A total of 313 studies were found, 158 were European studies from which the studies with data on women EDs accumulation were selected for detailed analysis (n = 90). The results were structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The present paper is an overview on the existent EDs analytical methods and levels accumulated in women adipose tissue, with the correspondent health implications across Europe. The limits of detection and quantification were compared and a discussion with results obtained about the presence of ED was performed.},

  abstract={Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) is an acceptable small laboratory fish model for the evaluation and assessment of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in the environment. In this research, we used this fish as a potential tool for the identification of EDCs that have a significant impact on human health. We conducted an electronic search in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) using the search terms, Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, and endocrine disruptions, and sorted 205 articles consisting of 128 chemicals that showed potential effects on estrogen-androgen-thyroid-steroidogenesis (EATS) pathways of Japanese medaka. From these chemicals, 14 compounds, namely, 17β-estradiol (E2), ethinylestradiol (EE2), tamoxifen (TAM), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), 17β-trenbolone (TRB), flutamide (FLU), vinclozolin (VIN), triiodothyronine (T3), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), terephthalic acid (TPA), trifloxystrobin (TRF), ketoconazole (KTC), and prochloraz (PCZ), were selected as references and used for the identification of apical endpoints within the EATS modalities. Among these endpoints, during classification, priorities are given to sex reversal (masculinization of females and feminization of males), gonad histology (testis-ova or ovotestis), secondary sex characteristics (anal fin papillae of males), plasma and liver vitellogenin (VTG) contents in males, swim bladder inflation during larval development, hepatic vitellogenin (vtg) and choriogenin (chg) genes in the liver of males, and several genes, including estrogen-androgen-thyroid receptors in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad/thyroid axis (HPG/T). After reviewing 205 articles, we identified 108 (52.68%), 46 (22.43%), 19 (9.26%), 22 (17.18%), and 26 (12.68%) papers that represented studies on estrogen endocrine disruptors (EEDs), androgen endocrine disruptors (AEDs), thyroid endocrine disruptors (TEDs), and/or steroidogenesis modulators (MOS), respectively. Most importantly, among 128 EDCs, 32 (25%), 22 (17.18%), 15 (11.8%), and 14 (10.93%) chemicals were classified as EEDs, AEDs, TEDs, and MOS, respectively. We also identified 43 (33.59%) chemicals as high-priority candidates for tier 2 tests, and 13 chemicals (10.15%) show enough potential to be considered EDCs without any further tier-based studies. Although our literature search was unable to identify the EATS targets of 45 chemicals (35%) studied in 60 (29.26%) of the 205 articles, our approach has sufficient potential to further move the laboratory-based research data on Japanese medaka for applications in regulatory risk assessments in humans.},

  abstract={Early childhood caries (ECC) are an oral health problem worldwide in children under 6 years of age. This disease of rapid development has a multifactorial etiology, and one of the possible risk factors is developmental defects of enamel (DDE), such as hypoplasia and opacities. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the association between DDE and ECC in children under 6 years of age. An electronic search was conducted until March 2022 using Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Science-Direct, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCO-Host, EMBASE, and Google Scholar and complemented with a manual search, with no restrictions on language or date of publication. Longitudinal studies of children under 6 years of age with primary dentition were included. A total of 1158 studies were found, of which 651 records were reviewed by title and abstract, and 24 articles were selected for full-text evaluation. Finally, nine studies that met the selection criteria were included in the qualitative synthesis. Study quality and certainty were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Three cohort studies of good quality were included in the meta-analysis. A risk associated with DDE (RR = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.52-2.49) and a risk associated with enamel hypoplasia (RR = 5.45; 95% CI: 1.84-16.14) were found. The results for diffuse opacity (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 0.18-8.15) and demarcated opacity (RR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.43-3.65) were not significant. GRADE analysis presented low and very low certainty of evidence. It was concluded that there is an association between DDE and ECC. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the study. The protocol for this study has been registered in PROSPERO under identification number CRD42021238919.},

  abstract={AIM: This meta-analysis aimed to assess the precision of Sonazoid contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) to distinguish hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) from focal liver lesions (FLLs). MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched and checked for studies using Sonazoid CEUS to characterize HCC. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted, involving data pooling, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and investigation of publication bias. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included fourteen studies. The overall diagnostic accuracy for characterizing HCC was as follows (all ranges show the 95% confidence interval): pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (0.80-0.92), pooled specificity of 0.95 (0.91-0.97), and a diagnostic odds ratio of 121 (61-241). The overall weighted area under the curve was 0.97 (0.95-0.98). The pooled sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio for Sonazoid and Sonovue were 0.75 (0.63- 0.84), 0.97 (0.86-0.99), 82 (15-445); and 0.64 (0.51-0.76), 0.98 (0.91-0.99), 72 (17-311), respectively. The sources of heterogeneity were identified as the study location, prevailing risk factor, reference diagnosis standard, criteria of Sonazoid CUES, and the proportion of cases of HCC. We observed no potential publication bias. CONCLUSION: Sonazoid CEUS is efficient to distinguish HCC from FLLs, with good sensitivity and specificity. It is comparable to Sonovue CEUS to diagnose HCC.},

  abstract={There is currently a growing interest in the so-called emerging pollutants, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal hygiene care products, drugs, etc., whose presence in natural ecosystems is not necessarily recent, but the development in latest years of new and more sensitive methods of analysis has allowed their detection. They can be present in the natural environment, food, and many products of everyday origin, which suggests that human exposure to them is massive and universal. Therefore, the study of this type of substances is becoming one of the priority lines of research of the main agencies dedicated to the protection of public and environmental health, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) or European Union (EU). In this sense, it is of vital importance to know the nature and quantity of this type of contaminants, to establish preventive mechanisms that minimize its presence in aquatic systems, with special requirements for human consumption. This study aimed to describe a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the status of pesticides in European waters. We will search for original studies in the PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect databases. Prevalence studies of emerging contaminants (pesticides) in water resources (watersheds, aquifers, rivers, marine and springs), wastewaters (influent and effluent), and drinking water should be included. Two reviewers will independently screen and assess the included studies, with any disagreements being resolved by a third reviewer. We will summarize the findings using a narrative approach and, if possible, conduct a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). We will conduct the protocol following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The review will summarize the current evidence on the presence of pesticides in European waters such as glyphosate, chlorpyrifos, pyrethroid pesticides, neonicotinoid pesticides, and/or fungicides, in samples of different water resources like wastewaters and drinking water. We expect that this systematic review will establish preventive mechanisms that minimize the presence of pesticides in water in the environment.},

  abstract={PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Organochlorine pesticides (OCP) have been proposed as potential mammary carcinogens since they interact with steroid signaling pathways. However, the epidemiological results are not conclusive. Most studies have evaluated breast cancer (BC) as a single entity without considering the different molecular expressions, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2, that could differ in their association with these contaminants. Hence, we assessed the association between biological concentration of OCP and BC, according to its molecular receptor expression, based on a systematic review and meta-analysis. RECENT FINDINGS: Of the 141 articles eligible for full-text review, nine met the inclusion criteria. The way in which molecular expression was reported was heterogeneous; therefore, the inclusion of studies in the meta-analysis was limited to eight articles. A negative association was identified for β-hexachlorocyclohexane and trans-nonachlor with ER + tumors and between hexachlorobenzene and ER - tumors. No associations were observed for p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, cis-nonachlor, and dieldrin, and it was not possible to evaluate the associations between OCP with HER2 expression or triple-negative tumors due to lack of data. The results suggest that some OCP might be associated with BC depending on the expression of ER. However, the evidence is not conclusive due to the scarce data. We identified several methodological aspects to fill the gaps in knowledge and increase the comparability among studies.},

  abstract={Despite the advances in modern medicine, the use of data-driven technologies (DDTs) to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) remains a major challenge. Scholars recognise that data management is the next frontier in infection prevention, but many aspects related to the benefits and advantages of using DDTs to mitigate SSI risk factors remain unclear and underexplored in the literature. This study explores how DDTs enable value creation in the prevention of SSIs. This study follows a systematic literature review approach and the PRISMA statement to analyse peer-reviewed articles from seven databases. Fifty-nine articles were included in the review and were analysed through a descriptive and a thematic analysis. The findings suggest a growing interest in DDTs in SSI prevention in the last 5 years, and that machine learning and smartphone applications are widely used in SSI prevention. DDTs are mainly applied to prevent SSIs in clean and clean-contaminated surgeries and often used to manage patient-related data in the postoperative stage. DDTs enable the creation of nine categories of value that are classified in four dimensions: cost/sacrifice, functional/instrumental, experiential/hedonic, and symbolic/expressive. This study offers a unique and systematic overview of the value creation aspects enabled by DDT applications in SSI prevention and suggests that additional research is needed in four areas: value co-creation and product-service systems, DDTs in contaminated and dirty surgeries, data legitimation and explainability, and data-driven interventions.

  abstract={Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is one of the interventions to control the vectors of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Different insecticides are used in affected countries, also in the Regional Initiative for the Elimination of VL in South-East Asia. This systematic review assesses all available studies analysing the effectiveness of IRS on the key vectors of VL. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, with a broad search strategy, applied to seven key databases. Inclusion criteria were studies focusing on 1) Visceral leishmaniasis 2) Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) or synonyms, and 3) all primary research methods. 21 studies were included, five cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), one randomised controlled trial (RCT), 11 intervention studies, also included were three modelling studies and one survey. 19 out of 21 included studies were published between 2009 and 2020. 18 of the studies were conducted in the context of the Regional Initiative. Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, confirmed in terms of effectiveness and by the availability of studies. Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts, and/or Phlebotomus argentipes counts by up to 95% with an effect of a minimum of one month. Prolonged effects are not regularly seen. DDT has been used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over time. Two intervention studies, embedded in larger programmes in 2019 and 2020, replaced DDT with alpha-Cypermethrin throughout the study. Combinations of different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as key issues for programmes. No human transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS-although modelling studies confirm the effect of IRS on human transmission. Concluding, IRS continues to be an effective intervention for Phlebotomus argentipes control. Delivery requires constant monitoring and quality assurance. Further studies need to assess IRS in different geographical areas affected by VL and combinations of interventions.},

  abstract={Strict measures have curbed the spread of COVID-19, but waste generation and movement limitations have had an unintended impact on the environment over the past 3 years (2020-2022). Many studies have summarized the observed and potential environmental impacts associated with COVID-19, however, only a few have quantified and compared the effects of these unintended environmental impacts; moreover, whether COVID-19 policy stringency had the same effects on the main environmental topic (i.e., CO(2) emissions) across the 3 years remains unclear. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of the recent literature and analyzed the main findings. We found that the positive environmental effects of COVID-19 have received more attention than the negative ones (50.6 % versus 35.7 %), especially in emissions reduction (34 % of total literature). Medical waste (14.5 %) received the highest attention among the negative impacts. Although global emission reduction, especially in terms of CO(2), has received significant attention, the positive impacts were temporary and only detected in 2020. Strict COVID-19 policies had a more profound and significant effect on CO(2) emissions in the aviation sector than in the power and industry sectors. For example, compared with 2019, international aviation related CO(2) emissions dropped by 59 %, 49 %, and 25 % in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, while industry related ones dropped by only 3.16 % in 2020. According to our developed evaluation matrix, medical wastes and their associated effects, including the persistent pollution caused by antibiotic resistance genes, heavy metals and microplastics, are the main challenges post the pandemic, especially in China and India, which may counteract the temporary environmental benefits of COVID-19. Overall, the presented results demonstrate methods to quantify the environmental effects of COVID-19 and provide directions for policymakers to develop measures to address the associated environmental issues in the post-COVID-19 world.},

This review aimed to shed light on the current outcomes of cervical spine endoscopic procedures for degenerative disc disease (DDD) and to calculate a pooled estimate of various outcome measures. METHODS: We retrieved articles published in English related to endoscopic cervical spine procedures from 3 central databases from inception until September 2020. A subgroup analysis based on the anterior versus the posterior approach was performed. RESULTS: Thirty-one articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria and included 1,410 patients. A successful outcome was observed in 91.3% (88.6-93.4%, P = 0.000). This percentage was lower for the anterior approach (89.6% [85.8-92.5%], P = 0.000) than for the posterior approach (94.2% [90.4-96.5%], P = 0.000). A higher percentage of poor outcomes was reported for the anterior approach (5.7% [3.2-10.1%], P = 0.000 vs. 2.3% [1-5.5%], P = 0.000 for the posterior approach). The overall complication rate was 7.2% (5.2-9.8%, P = 0.000). There was a slightly higher complication rate for the anterior approach (7.9% [4.5-13.3%], P = 0.000) than for the posterior approach (6.7% [4.4-10%], P = 0.000). The revision rate was 4.2% (2.6-6.8%, P = 0.000); and 4.2% (1.8-9.7%, P = 0.000) for the anterior approach and 4.00% (2.2-7.4%, P = 0.000) for the posterior approach. CONCLUSIONS: There is a higher success rate and lower complication rate with the posterior approach than with the anterior approach. However, high-quality randomized controlled trials are vital to evaluate the efficacy of these procedures.},

  abstract={Exposure to pesticides during pregnancy has been associated with several serious congenital malformations, such as neural tube defects, therefore, is a cause for concern in terms of human health. This review aims to gather information related to maternal exposure during pregnancy and the risk of triggering neural tube defects in the offspring. The search strategy for the studies followed the PRISMA guidelines. We conducted a systematic search in the Science Direct, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for all epidemiological studies that sought to associate exposure to pesticides during embryonic development with the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). The keywords used were "pesticide", "herbicide", "congenital" and "neural". Of the 229 articles, 8 eligible ones (7 case-control and 1 cross-sectional) evaluated pesticide exposure in pregnancy. Different methods were used, including analysis of biological samples and questionnaires. The pesticides studied included insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and nematicides. Insecticides were the most studied, with variations in concentrations between tissues and studies. Distinct levels of pesticides have been detected in maternal serum, placenta, and umbilical cord. Models were statistically adjusted for confounding factors, such as smoking and dietary supplement intakes. Concentrations were measured in different exposure windows (periconception and prenatal), related to NTDs such as anencephaly and spina bifida. Different data collection techniques, types of biological samples, and exposure windows were used, which made comparison difficult. The main pesticides studied included DDT, DDE, HCH, and endosulfan. Maternal serum showed the highest concentrations of pesticides, but detection in placental tissue and umbilical cord confirms embryonic exposure. Confounding variables were adjusted for in the analysis of the articles, but they may still contribute to the risk of NTDs. All the studies analyzed pesticide exposure and the relationship with NTDs. However, a more standardized survey would be ideal for better comparisons.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Greenhouse gases (GHGs) that trap heat in the atmosphere are composed of carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases (synthetic hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and nitrogen trifluoride). In the USA, the health sector accounts for 8.5% of total GHG emissions. The primary objective of this systematic review was to critically analyse the carbon emissions data from GI endoscopic activity. DESIGN: The GI endoscopy carbon cycle was evaluated at preprocedural, intraprocedural and postprocedural levels. We performed a systematic literature search of articles published on these issues until 30 June 2022 and discussed these available data on endoscopy unit GHG carbon cycle, barriers to reduce GHG emissions and potential solutions. The inclusion criteria were any full-text articles (observational, clinical trials, brief communications, case series and editorials) reporting waste generation from GI endoscopy. Abstracts, news articles and conference proceedings were excluded. RESULTS: Our search yielded 393 records in PubMed, 1708 in Embase and 24 in Google Scholar. After application of inclusion and exclusion factors, we focused on 9 fulllength articles in detail, only 3 of them were cross-sectional studies (all from the USA), the others reviews or position statements. Therefore, the quality of the studies could not be assessed due to heterogeneity in definitions and amount of emissions. CONCLUSIONS: Recognition of carbon emissions generated by GI endoscopy activity is critical. Although multiple limitations exists for quantification of these emission, there is an urgent need for collecting proper data as well as examining novel methods for reduction of these emissions for a sustainable endoscopic practices in the future.},

  abstract={As aluminum nanoparticles (Al-NPs) are widely used in our daily life and various industries, Al-NPs has been becoming an emerging pollution in the environment. The impact of this NP has been attracting more and more attention from the scientific communities. In this review, we systematically summarized the interactions, uptake, and transport of Al-NPs in the plant system. Al-NPs can enter plants through different pathways and accumulate in various tissues, leading to alter plant growth and development. Al-NPs also affected root, shoot, and leaf characteristics as well as changing nutrient uptake and distribution and inducing oxidative stress via excess reactive radical generation, thereby impairing plant defense systems. Additionally, Al-NPs altered gene expression, which involved in various signaling pathways and metabolic processes in plants, that further altered plants susceptible or tolerant to stressors. The review also emphasized the effects of Al-NP size, surface charge, concentration, and exposure duration on plant growth and development. In the future, more research should be focused on mechanisms underlying Al-NPs phytotoxicity and potential risk to humans and off-target species.},

We summarize studies on the association between prenatal PFAS exposure and neurodevelopment in children in order to better understand the relationship. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a meta-analysis of prenatal PFAS exposure and developmental outcomes associated with intellectual, executive function and behavioral difficulty in children to explore the relationship between prenatal exposure to perfluorinated and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and neurodevelopmental disorders in children. METHODS: We searched for articles published up to August 3, 2023, included and quantified original studies on PFAS and child Intelligence Quotient (IQ), executive function and behavioral difficulty during pregnancy, and systematically summarized articles that could not be quantified. CONCLUSION: There is evidence of sex-specific relationship between PFAS exposure and children's PIQ. We found that PFOS [β = -1.56, 95% CI = -2.96, - 0.07; exposure = per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase], PFOA [β = -1.87, 95% CI = -3.29, - 0.46; exposure = per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase], PFHxS [β = -2.02, 95% CI = -3.23, - 0.81; exposure = per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase] decreased performance IQ in boys, but PFOS [β = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.06, 3.06; exposure = per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase] increased performance IQ in girls. PFAS are associated with executive function impairments in children, but not related to behavioral difficulty in children.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: The treatments for trochanteric fractures try to regain early mobility and limit morbidity and risk of reoperations. The most currently used dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the proximal femoral nail (PFN) are both with pros and cons. We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of these interventions for trochanteric fractures by evaluating the surgical performance and postoperative outcomes. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register were searched for RCTs comparing DHS and PFN for trochanteric fractures. All selected studies and the risk of bias were assessed. Clinical data including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, successful closed reduction and complications like nonunion, implant failure and reoperation were recorded. Random-effects models were used in Review Manager software, and GRADE was applied for the interpretation of the evidence. RESULTS: From 286 identified trials, twelve RCTs including 1889 patients were eligible for inclusion; six RCTs directly comparing DHS with PFN, while other six compared DHS with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). Compared to DHS, PFN had shorter operative time and led to less intraoperative blood loss. However, DHS need less intraoperative fluoroscopy time than PFN. No difference was seen for the achievement of closed reduction. For risk of postoperative complications, no difference was seen between PFN and DHS for non-union, risk of implant failure and revision surgery. CONCLUSIONS: PFN(A) resulted in a shorter operative time and less intraoperative blood loss compared to DHS. However, no difference was seen for postoperative complications.

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Coroners, who hold inquests to determine the causes of unnatural deaths in England and Wales, having recognised factors that could cause other deaths, are legally obliged to signal concerns by sending 'Reports to Prevent Future Deaths' (PFDs) to interested persons. We aimed to establish whether Coroners' concerns about medications are widely recognised. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science up to 30 November, 2022 for publications linking PFDs and medications using a combination of search terms "coroner*", "inquest*", "medicine*", "medication*" and "prevent*". We also searched the BMJ, a UK journal that carries news items; and the databases Nexis Advance and News On the Web for reports in national newspapers between 2013 and 2022, using the search terms ("regulation 28" OR "prevent future deaths" OR "prevention of future deaths") AND "coroner". We recorded the number of publications, as well as their citations in Google Scholar at 23 May, 2023. RESULTS: Only 11 published papers on medicines referenced UK PFDs, nine of which were from our group. The BMJ carried 23 articles mentioning PFDs, five related to medicines. Of 139 PFDs (out of over 4000) mentioned in national newspapers, only nine related to medicines. CONCLUSIONS: The PFDs related to medicines are not widely referred to in medical journals or UK national newspapers. By contrast, the Australian and New Zealand National Coronial Information System has contributed cases to 206 publications cited in PubMed, of which 139 are related to medicines. Our search suggests that information from English and Welsh Coroners' PFDs is under-recognised, even though it should inform public health. The results of inquiries by Coroners and medical examiners worldwide into potentially preventable deaths involving medicines should be used to strengthen the safety of medicines.},

  abstract={Pesticide contamination in water resources is a global threat. Although usually found at low concentrations, pesticides raise considerable toxicological concerns, mainly when mixtures are considered. The occurrence of 22 pesticides (2,4 D, alachlor, aldicarb, aldrin, atrazine, carbendazim, carbofuran, chlordane, chlorpyrifos, DDT, diuron, glyphosate, lindane, mancozeb, methamidophos, metolachlor, molinate, profenofos, simazine, tebuconazole, terbufos, and trifluralin) was investigated, through consolidated database information, in surface freshwaters of Brazil. Moreover, scenarios of environmental risk assessment considering isolated compounds and mixtures were performed, as well as a meta-analytic approach for toxicity purposes. Pesticides in freshwater have been reported from 719 cities (12.9% of Brazilian cities), where 179 (3.2%) showed pesticide occurrence above the limit of detection or quantification. Considering cities with more than five quantified, 16 cities were prone to environmental risks considering individual risks. However, the number increased to 117 cities when the pesticide mixture was considered. The mixture risk was driven by atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and DDT. The national maximum acceptable concentrations (MAC) for nearly all pesticides are higher than the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for the species evaluated, except aldrin. Our results show the need to consider mixtures in the environmental risk assessment to avoid underestimation and review MAC to protect aquatic ecosystems. The results presented here may guide the revision of the national environmental legislation to ensure the protection of Brazilian aquatic ecosystems.},

METHODS: A study search was carried out in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to July 22, 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the quality of the eligible studies. The risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as effect size indicators in this meta-analysis to evaluate the risk association between pioglitazone and PD. The Cochran's Q and I(2) tests were used to assess statistical heterogeneity. A dose-response meta-analysis was conducted using the least squares trend estimation method. RESULTS: Three studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. Compared with diabetes patients who did not use pioglitazone, there was a significant reduction in the risk of PD (RR of 0.87 [95 % CI 0.62-0.99, P = 0.039]) in pioglitazone users. No significant difference in PD risk was noted in diabetes patients taking 438 dose-duration-days (DDDs) of pioglitazone or lower compared with those who did not. When the DDD of pioglitazone was 438, the RR was 0.85 (95 % CI [0.72-1.00], P = 0.05). When the DDD of pioglitazone was > 438, the risk of PD in patients with diabetes was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and showed an approximate linear correlation trend. CONCLUSION: Pioglitazone administration in PD in diabetes patients is significantly associated with a decrease in the risk of PD.},

  abstract={Endometriosis, characterized by endometrial-like mucosal tissue outside the uterine cavity, is a reproductive disorder afflicting about 10% of women within the reproductive age. The pathogenesis of endometriosis has been attributed to factors like genetics, environmental particles, and hormones. A comprehensive review of studies from July 2010 to July 2023 across multiple databases was done to aid in a better understanding of the same. The investigation focused on studies delineating the correlation between endocrine disruptors, microRNAs, and endometriosis. To optimize the search scope, keywords and subject headings were used as search terms. Then, two authors rigorously assessed studies using criteria, selecting 27 studies from various databases. Notably, dioxins, organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls exhibited a solid connection for endometriosis, while bisphenol A and phthalates yielded conflicting results. The heightened presence of bisphenol A, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalates was linked to altered gene expression, including genes like AKR1B10, AKR1C3, and FAM49B. MicroRNAs like miRNA-31, miRNA-144, and miRNA-145 emerged as vital factors in the onset of endometriosis and progression. Furthermore, elevated expression of miR-1304-3p, miR-544, and miR-3684 and reduced expression of miR-3935 and miR-4427 exert substantial influence on signaling pathways like NF-κB, MAPK, and Wnt/β-catenin. Currently, literature shows an independent link between endocrine disruptor exposure and endometriosis and between microRNA dysregulation and endometriosis. However, research lacks the combination of all three factors. The review delves into the effects of endocrine disruptors and microRNAs on the pathogenesis of endometriosis to improve our understanding of the disorder and in finding therapies.},

  abstract={Demand for rice labeled as organic is growing globally. Consumers state that foods labeled as organic are nutritionally superior and safer than their conventionally produced equivalent. The research question for this systematic review is as follows: is there a difference between the effects of sustainable agriculture and conventional farming methods on rice grain end-use quality, healthfulness, and safety? The studies (n = 23) examined for this review suggest that organic production practices don't influence most end-use quality (e.g., chalk, milling yield, pasting properties) and healthfulness (e.g., gamma-oryzanol fraction and tocols) traits studied, or if it does, it will be to a small degree. If differences in end-use quality traits are found, they will be associated with grain protein content, which varies along with the dose of nitrogen applied during rice growth. We conclude that the studies evaluated in this review found that organically produced rice grain was less likely to contain residues of the pesticides (e.g., organochlorine) examined in the study than the rice is grown using conventional methods. There was some evidence that organically grown rice is more likely to be contaminated with mycotoxin-producing fungi and some mycotoxins. Common shortcomings of the studies were that they were poorly designed, with limited to no details of the cultural management practices used to grow the rice studied, the length of time fields was under organic management not stated, cultivars were not named, and the data wasn't analyzed statistically.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Findings related to the association between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are inconclusive. OBJECTIVES: To estimate the strength of the association between POP exposure and GDM in a systematic review with meta-analysis. SEARCH STRATEGY: MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched until July 2023. SELECTION CRITERIA: Cohort and case-control studies analysing the association between POPs and GDM. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed the risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies scale (QUIPS). Standardised mean differences were pooled using random-effect models. MAIN RESULTS: Sixteen articles including 12 216 participants were selected. The risk of bias was high in four articles (25%), moderate in 11 (68.75%) and low in one (6.25%). Small mean difference between GDM cases and controls was observed for PFHpA (0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1-0.35, I(2)  = 0.0%), PCB180 (0.37, 95% CI 0.19-0.56; I(2)  = 25.3%), BDE47 (0.23, 95% CI 0.0-0.45, I(2)  = 0%), BDE99 (0.36, 95% CI 0.14-0.59; I(2)  = 0%), BDE100 (0.42, 95% CI 0.19-0.64; I(2)  = 0%) and HCB (0.22, 95% CI 0.01-0.42, I(2)  = 39.6%). No considerable difference was observed for the rest of POPs. CONCLUSION: Small mean differences between GDM cases and controls were observed for some POPs. However, evidence shows mostly moderate quality and results were heterogeneous. Improved research methodology is needed to assess POPs and GDM risk.},

  abstract={PURPOSES: To investigate the incidence and factors influencing the occurrence of metamorphopsia in patients with simple rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) after surgery. METHODS: Relevant studies of metamorphopsia were identified by searching in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane until August 2022. Meta-analysis of the incidence of metamorphopsia after rhegmatogenous retinal detachment surgery was performed using Review Manager 5.4 statistical software. RESULTS: A total of 12 studies reported 1133 participants with 469 patients with postoperative metamorphopsia. The meta-analysis showed a higher incidence of metamorphopsia in macular-off cases compared with macular-on RRD (RR = 2.88, 95% CI: 2.35 to 3.52). The use of perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) during pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) reduced the incidence of metamorphopsia (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.92). There was no evidence of any important difference in metamorphopsia between participants in the PPV group and the scleral buckling (SB) group (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.33). There was little or no difference in metamorphopsia between gas and silicon oil (SO) in the PPV group (RR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.13). CONCLUSION: The incidence of postoperative metamorphopsia is higher in macular-off RRD, and PFCL should be a preferred choice to prevent postoperative metamorphopsia in macula-off RRD cases.},

  abstract={Emerging pollutants (EPs) emerged as a group of new compounds whose presence in the environment has been widely detected in Mexico. In this country, different concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds, pesticides, dyes, and microplastics have been reported, which vary depending on the region and the analyzed matrix (i.e., wastewater, surface water, groundwater). The evidence of the EPs' presence focuses on the detection of them, but there is a gap in information regarding is biomonitoring and their effects in health in Mexico. The presence of these pollutants in the country associated with lack of proper regulations in the discharge and disposal of EPs. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive view of the current environmental status, policies, and frameworks regarding Mexico's situation. The review also highlights the lack of information about biomonitoring since EPs are present in water even after their treatment, leading to a critical situation, which is high exposure to humans and animals. Although, technologies to efficiently eliminate EPs are available, their application has been reported only at a laboratory scale thus far. Here, an overview of health and environmental impacts and a summary of the research works reported in Mexico from 2014 to 2023 were presented. This review concludes with a concrete point of view and perspective on the status of the EPs' research in Mexico as an alert for government entities about the necessity of measures to control the EPs disposal and treatment.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Esophageal cancer (EC) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and the morbidity and mortality of EC have continued to increase in recent years. The results of the clinical application of the Fast-track recovery surgery (FTS) concept in nursing interventions for EC patients after total endoscopic esophagectomy are unconvincing. This study sought to evaluate the nursing effect of the fast-track recovery surgical nursing model on patients with EC after total cavity endoscopic esophagectomy. METHODS: We searched for articles on case-control trials about nursing interventions after total endoscopic esophagectomy. The search time was set from January 2010 to May 2022. The data were independently extracted by 2 researchers. RevMan5.3 statistical software (Cochrane) was used to analyze the extracted data. All the articles included in the review were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Handbook 5.3 (https://training.cochrane.org/). RESULTS: Ultimately, 8 clinical controlled trials, comprising 613 cases, were identified. A meta-analysis was conducted of the extubation times, and the results showed that the study group's extubation times were remarkably shorter. In relation to the exhaust times, the study group had significantly shorter exhaust times than control group (P<0.05). In relation to the time, it took patients to leave bed, patients in the study group left bed in a considerably shorter time compared with controls (P<0.00001). In relation to the hospitalization time, a remarkable reduction in the length of hospital stay was observed in the study group (P<0.00001). The analysis of the funnel plots showed a small number of asymmetries, suggesting that the number of articles included was small due to the heterogeneity of the studies (P<0.00001). CONCLUSIONS: FTS care is effective at accelerating patients' postoperative recovery. This model of care needs to be further validated in the future by higher-quality and longer follow-up studies.},

  abstract={A meta-analysis was conducted of published literature reporting concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater for sites distributed in 20 countries across the globe. Data for >35 PFAS were aggregated from 96 reports published from 1999 to 2021. The final data set comprises approximately 21,000 data points after removal of time-series and duplicate samples as well as non-detects. The reported concentrations range over many orders of magnitude, from ng/L to mg/L levels. Distinct differences in concentration ranges are observed between sites located within or near sources versus those that are not. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranging from <0.03 ng/L to ~7 mg/L, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), ranging from 0.01 ng/L to ~5 mg/L, were the two most reported PFAS. The highest PFAS concentration in groundwater is ~15 mg/L reported for the replacement-PFAS 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). Maximum reported groundwater concentrations for PFOA and PFOS were compared to concentrations reported for soils, surface waters, marine waters, and precipitation. Soil concentrations are generally significantly higher than those reported for the other media. This accrues to soil being the primary entry point for PFAS release into the environment for many sites, as well as the generally significantly greater retention capacity of soil compared to the other media. The presence of PFAS has been reported for all media in all regions tested, including areas that are far removed from specific PFAS sources. This gives rise to the existence of a "background" concentration of PFAS that must be accounted for in both regional and site-specific risk assessments. The presence of this background is a reflection of the large-scale use of PFAS, their general recalcitrance, and the action of long-range transport processes that distribute PFAS across regional and global scales. This ubiquitous distribution has the potential to significantly impact the quality and availability of water resources in many regions. In addition, the pervasive presence of PFAS in the environment engenders concerns for impacts to ecosystem and human health.},

  abstract={Donor human milk (DHM) from a milk bank is the recommended feeding method for preterm infants when the mother's own milk (MOM) is not available. Despite this recommendation, information on the possible contamination of donor human milk and its impact on infant health outcomes is poorly characterised. The aim of this systematic review is to assess contaminants present in DHM samples that preterm and critically ill infants consume. The data sources used include PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science. A search of the data sources targeting DHM and its potential contaminants yielded 426 publications. Two reviewers (S. T. and D. L.) conducted title/abstract screening through Covidence software, and predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded 26 manuscripts. Contaminant types (bacterial, chemical, fungal, viral) and study details (e.g., type of bacteria identified, study setting) were extracted from each included study during full-text review. Primary contaminants in donor human milk included bacterial species and environmental pollutants. We found that bacterial contaminants were identified in 100% of the papers in which bacterial contamination was sought (16 papers) and 61.5% of the full data set (26 papers), with the most frequently identified genera being Staphylococcus (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) and Bacillus (e.g., Bacillus cereus). Chemical pollutants were discovered in 100% of the papers in which chemical contamination was sought (eight papers) and 30.8% of the full data set (26 papers). The most frequently identified chemical pollutants included perfluoroalkyl substances (six papers), toxic metal (one paper) and caffeine (one paper). Viral and fungal contamination were identified in one paper each. Our results highlight the importance of establishing standardisation in assessing DHM contamination and future studies are needed to clarify the impact of DHM contaminants on health outcomes.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Social and behavioural drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Recent reports indicate the Australian community consumes more than twice the defined daily doses (DDD) of antibiotics per 1000 population than in Sweden, and about 20% more than in the United Kingdom (UK). We compare measures of public knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surrounding AMR in Australia, the UK and Sweden against the policy approaches taken in these settings to address inappropriate antibiotic use. METHODS: National antimicrobial stewardship policies in Australia, Sweden, and the UK were reviewed, supplemented by empirical studies of their effectiveness. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL databases for primary studies of the general public's KAP around antibiotic use and AMR in each setting (January 1 2011 until July 30 2021). Where feasible, we meta-analysed data on the proportion of participants agreeing with identical or very similar survey questions, using a random effects model. RESULTS: Policies in Sweden enact tighter control of community antibiotic use; reducing antibiotic use through public awareness raising is not a priority. Policies in the UK and Australia are more reliant on practitioner and public education to encourage appropriate antibiotic use. 26 KAP were included in the review and 16 were meta-analysable. KAP respondents in Australia and the UK are consistently more likely to report beliefs and behaviours that are not aligned with appropriate antibiotic use, compared to participants in similar studies conducted in Sweden. CONCLUSIONS: Interactions between public knowledge, attitudes and their impacts on behaviours surrounding community use of antibiotics are complex and contingent. Despite a greater focus on raising public awareness in Australia and the UK, neither antibiotic consumption nor community knowledge and attitudes are changing significantly. Clearly public education campaigns can contribute to mitigating AMR. However, the relative success of policy approaches taken in Sweden suggests that practice level interventions may also be required to activate prescribers and the communities they serve to make substantive reductions in inappropriate antibiotic use.},

  abstract={As part of its core mission, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is tasked with assessing the hazards and risks to human health from exposure to pollutants. While some pollutants are well studied, there are little or no data on the potential health effects for many thousands of chemicals that can make their way into the environment, such as PFAS. EPA still relies on laboratory mammalian studies as the foundation of most human health risk assessments, which are limited by high costs, long timelines, and other concerns. New approach methods (NAMs) in toxicology, for example new in vivo and in vitro strategies and computational systems biology, offer opportunities to inform timely decision-making when no data are available from laboratory mammalian toxicity tests or epidemiological studies. NAMs may also help inform efforts to protect susceptible and vulnerable populations by characterizing subtle health perturbations, better encompassing genetic diversity, and accounting for nonchemical stressors. While the promise and need for NAMs is clear, many barriers to their use remain. This report aims to bridge the gap between the potential of NAMs and their practical application in human health risk assessment. Building Confidence in New Evidence Streams for Human Health Risk Assessment draws lessons learned from laboratory mammalian toxicity tests to help inform approaches for building scientific confidence in NAMs and for incorporating such data into risk assessment and decision-making. Overall, the report recommendations aim to ensure a seamless handoff from the evaluation of NAM-based testing strategies in the laboratory to the incorporation of NAM data into modern, systematic-review-based risk assessments.},

  abstract={IMPORTANCE: Understanding the status of pelvic floor disorder (PFD) disparities research will allow the opportunity to advance future pelvic floor equity efforts. OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to (1) characterize the landscape of PFD disparities literature using the 3 phases of disparities research framework, (2) describe the characteristics of PFD disparities studies, and (3) identify critical knowledge gaps. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications addressing disparities in PFDs among U.S. populations from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, or the Cochrane Database indexed between 1997 and 2022. Using the triphasic framework for advancing health disparities research by Kilbourne et al (Am J Public Health. 2006;96(12):2113-21), we categorized the included studies into the detecting phase (identifies and measures disparities in historically marginalized populations), understanding phase (establishes disparity determinants), or reducing phase (conducts interventions to alleviate inequities). All screening, coding, and quality reviews were independently performed by at least 2 authors. We used descriptive analysis and the χ2 test for comparisons. RESULTS: The initial search identified 10,178 studies, of which 123 were included. Of the included studies, 98 (79.7%), 22 (17.9%), and 3 (2.4%) studies were detecting, understanding, and reducing phase research, respectively. The most common disparity category investigated was race and ethnicity (104 studies), and one third of these studies attributed drivers of racial and ethnic differences to structural influences. Publications of detecting phase studies outpaced the growth of understanding and reducing phase research. CONCLUSIONS: Most PFD disparities research focused on identifying historically marginalized populations with inadequate progression to understanding and reducing phases. We recommend progressing PFD disparities research beyond the detecting phase to advance health equity in PFD care.},

  abstract={Plastic pollution has become one of the most serious environmental problems, and microplastics (MPs, particles < 5 mm size) may behave as a vehicle of organic pollutants, causing detrimental effects to the environment. Studies on MP-sorbed organic pollutants lack methodological standardization, resulting in a low comparability and replicability. In this work, we reviewed 40 field studies of MP-sorbed organic contaminants using PRISMA guidelines for acquiring information on sampling and analytical protocols. The papers were also scored for their reliability on the basis of 7 criteria, from 0 (minimum) to 21 (maximum). Our results showed a great heterogeneity of the methods used for the sample collection, MPs extraction, and instruments for chemicals' identification. Measures for cross-contamination control during MPs analysis were strictly applied only in 13% of the studies, indicating a need for quality control in MPs-related research. The most frequently detected MP-sorbed chemicals were polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Most of the studies showed a good reliability (>75% of the total score), with 32 papers scoring 16 or higher. On the basis of the collected information, a standardizable protocol for the detection of MPs and MP-sorbed chemicals has been suggested for improving the reliability of MPs monitoring studies.},

  abstract={The pervasive presence of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in diverse products has led to their introduction into wastewater systems, making wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) significant PFAS contributors to the environment. Despite WWTPs' efforts to mitigate PFAS impact through physicochemical and biological means, concerns persist regarding PFAS retention in generated biosolids. While numerous review studies have explored the fate of these compounds within WWTPs, no study has critically reviewed their presence, transformation mechanisms, and partitioning within the sludge. Therefore, the current study has been specifically designed to investigate these aspects. Studies show variations in PFAS concentrations across WWTPs, highlighting the importance of aqueous-to-solid partitioning, with sludge from PFOS and PFOA-rich wastewater showing higher concentrations. Research suggests biological mechanisms such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, transamine metabolism, and beta-oxidation are involved in PFAS biotransformation, though the effects of precursor changes require further study. Carbon chain length significantly affects PFAS partitioning, with longer chains leading to greater adsorption in sludge. The wastewater's organic and inorganic content is crucial for PFAS adsorption; for instance, higher sludge protein content and divalent cations like calcium and magnesium promote adsorption, while monovalent cations like sodium impede it. In conclusion, these discoveries shed light on the complex interactions among factors affecting PFAS behavior in biosolids. They underscore the necessity for thorough considerations in managing PFAS presence and its impact on environmental systems.},

  abstract={Brazil is the third largest exporter of fruits and vegetables in the world and, consequently, uses large amounts of pesticides. Food contamination with pesticide residues (PRs) is a serious concern, especially in developing countries. Several research reports revealed that some Brazilian farmers spray pesticides on fruits and vegetables in large quantities, generating PRs after harvest. Thus, ingestion of food contaminated with PRs can cause adverse health effects. Based on information obtained through a systematic review of essential information from 33 articles, we studied the assessment of potential health risks associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in children and adults from Brazilian states. This study identified 111 PRs belonging to different chemical groups, mainly organophosphates and organochlorines, in 26 fruit and vegetable samples consumed and exported by Brazil. Sixteen of these PRs were above the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) established by local and international legislation. We did not identify severe acute and chronic dietary risks, but the highest risk values were observed in São Paulo and Santa Catarina, associated with the consumption of tomatoes and sweet peppers due to the high concentrations of organophosphates. A high long-term health risk is associated with the consumption of oranges in São Paulo and grapes in Bahia due to chlorothalonil and procymidone. We also identified that 26 PRs are considered carcinogenic by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), and the carcinogenic risk analysis revealed no severe risk in any Brazilian state investigated due to the cumulative hazard index (HI) < 1. However, the highest HI values were in São Paulo due to acephate and carbaryl in sweet pepper and in Bahia due to dichlorvos. This information can help regulatory authorities define new guidelines for pesticide residue limits in fruits and vegetables commonly consumed and exported from Brazil and monitor the quality of commercial formulations.},

  abstract={Epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is associated with lipid profile levels, but with inconsistent conclusions from different studies. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship between PFAS exposure and lipid profile levels based on population-based epidemiological studies. Embase, PubMed, Ovid database, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science database were used to search appropriate studies (before September 6, 2022) on the correlation between PFAS exposure and lipid profile levels. β value, odd ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from studies. In this study, we found that higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were associated with exposure to perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) (β value=0.13, 95 % CIs: 0.02, 0.24) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (β value=0.13, 95 % CIs: 0.04, 0.21). PFOA, PFOS and PFNA exposure were significantly related to the higher levels of total cholesterol (TC) with the pooled effect estimates of 0.08 (95 % CI: 0.02, 0.14), 0.13 (95 % CI: 0.05, 0.21) and 0.14 (95 % CI: 0.08, 0.20) respectively. In sum, our results identified that PFOA, PFOS, PFNA and PFUnDA were the most important risk factors for abnormal levels of lipid profile, indicating that we should prevent cerebrovascular disease by reducing and controlling PFAS exposure.},

  abstract={The objective of this study was to determine the associations between maternal exposure to PFASs and infant birth weight and to explore evidence for a possible dose-response relationship. Four databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Medline before 20 September 2022 were systematically searched. A fixed-effect model was used to estimate the change in infant birth weight (g) associated with PFAS concentrations increasing by 10-fold. Dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted when possible. The study follows the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A total of 21 studies were included. Among these studies, 18 studies examined the associations between PFOA and birth weight, 17 studies reported PFOS, and 11 studies discussed PFHxS. Associations between PFHxS (ES = -5.67, 95% CI: -33.92 to 22.59, P = 0.694) were weaker than those for PFOA and PFOS (ES = -58.62, 95% CI: -85.23 to -32.01, P < 0.001 for PFOA; ES = -54.75, 95% CI: -84.48 to -25.02, P < 0.001 for PFOS). The association was significantly stronger in the high median PFOS concentration group (ES = -107.23, 95% CI: -171.07 to -43.39, P < 0.001) than the lower one (ES = -29.15, 95% CI: -63.60 to -5.30, P = 0.097; meta-regression, P = 0.045). Limited evidence of a dose-response relationship was found. This study showed negative associations between maternal exposure to PFASs and infant birth weight.

We went through 4 major databases. A study was conducted by PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and the Web of Science to determine the effect of comparison of FTS versus conventional surgery in RP on postoperative wound complications as of 1 July 2023. Based on the review of literature, data extraction and literature quality assessment, we conducted meta-analyses with RevMan 5.3. In the course of the study, the researchers selected 6 of the 404 studies to be analysed according to exclusion criteria. Data analysis showed that the FTS method reduced the postoperative pain associated with VAS and also decreased the rate of postoperative complications in post-surgical patients. However, there was no significant difference between FTS and conventional surgery in terms of blood loss, operation time, and postoperative infection rate. Therefore, generally speaking, FTS has less impact on postoperative complications in patients with minimal invasive prostatic cancer, but it does reduce postoperative pain and total postoperative complications.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemicals characterized by their environmental persistence. Evidence suggests that exposure to POPs, which is ubiquitous, is associated with microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. miRNA are key regulators in many physiological processes. It is thus of public health concern to understand the relationships between POPs and miRNA as related to health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: This systematic review evaluated the relationship between widely recognized, intentionally manufactured, POPs, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB]), with miRNA expression in both human and animal studies. METHODS: We used PubMed and Embase to systematically search the literature up to September 29th, 2023. Search results for human and animal studies were included if they incorporated at least one POP of interest in relation to at least one miRNA. Data were synthesized to determine the direction and significance of associations between POPs and miRNA. We utilized ingenuity pathway analysis to review disease pathways for miRNA that were associated with POPs. RESULTS: Our search identified 38 eligible studies: 9 in humans and 29 in model organisms. PFAS were associated with decreased expression of miR-19, miR-193b, and miR-92b, as well as increased expression of miR-128, miR-199a-3p, and miR-26b across species. PCBs were associated with increased expression of miR-15a, miR-1537, miR-21, miR-22-3p, miR-223, miR-30b, and miR-34a, as well as decreased expression of miR-130a and let-7b in both humans and animals. Pathway analysis for POP-associated miRNA identified pathways related to carcinogenesis. DISCUSSION: This is the first systematic review of the association of POPs with miRNA in humans and model organisms. Large-scale prospective human studies are warranted to examine the role of miRNA as mediators between POPs and health outcomes.},

  abstract={We synthesized the epidemiologic evidence on the associations between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and breast cancer risk. Our systematic review and meta-analysis included 18 and 11 articles, respectively, covering studies up to February 2023. The summary relative risks (RR) estimated by random-effects meta-analyses did not support an association between PFAS and overall breast cancer risk (e.g., a natural log (ln)-unit increase in serum/plasma concentrations [ng/mL] for perfluorooctanoate [PFOA] RR=0.95, 95% confidence interval [CI]:0.77-1.18; perfluorooctane sulfonate [PFOS] RR=0.98, 95%CI: 0.87-1.11). However, when limiting to studies that assessed exposures prior to a breast cancer diagnosis, we observed a positive association with PFOA (a ln-unit increase, RR=1.16, 95%CI: 0.96-1.40). We also observed some possible heterogeneous associations by tumor estrogen and progesterone receptor status among postmenopausal breast cancer cases. No meaningful changes were observed after excluding the studies with high risk-of-bias (Tier 3). Based on the evaluation tool developed by the National Toxicology Program, given the heterogeneity across studies and the variability in timing of exposure measurements, the epidemiologic evidence needed to determine the association between PFAS exposure and breast cancer remains inadequate. Our findings support the need for future studies with improved study designs to determine this association.},

Moreover, different experimental and analytical methodologies employed by different studies pose challenges when comparing findings across studies. To explore the molecular mechanisms of EDCs in a systematic manner, we established a data-driven computational approach to meta-analyze 30 human, mouse, and rat liver transcriptomic datasets for 4 EDCs, namely bisphenol A (BPA), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), tributyltin (TBT), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Our computational pipeline uniformly re-analyzed pre-processed quality-controlled microarray data and raw RNAseq data, derived differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological pathways, modeled gene regulatory networks and regulators, and determined CMD associations based on gene overlap analysis. Our approach revealed that DEHP and PFOA shared stable transcriptomic signatures that are enriched for genes associated with CMDs, suggesting similar mechanisms of action such as perturbations of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling and liver gene network regulators VNN1 and ACOT2. In contrast, TBT exhibited highly divergent gene signatures, pathways, network regulators, and disease associations from the other EDCs. In addition, we found that the rat, mouse, and human BPA studies showed highly variable transcriptomic patterns, providing molecular support for the variability in BPA responses. Our work offers insights into the commonality and differences in the molecular mechanisms of various EDCs and establishes a streamlined data-driven workflow to compare molecular mechanisms of environmental substances to elucidate the underlying connections between chemical exposure and disease risks.},

  abstract={Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria is one of the preeminent concerns for the future of global health. There is a dose-dependent relationship between antimicrobial use (AMU) and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. As most AMU in Canada is related to animal agriculture, there is a need to reduce overall AMU, which could be accomplished through surveillance of AMU in animal agriculture, including the dairy industry. The objective of this study was to quantify AMU on dairy farms across Canada. This study had two parts: a description of data collected in 2019-2020, and a meta-analysis comparing this data to previous estimates of AMU in the Canadian dairy industry. The first included a garbage can audit (GCA) on 107 farms in four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Nova Scotia) in 2020; AMU data were converted to the dose-based metrics of defined course doses (DCD) and defined daily doses (DDD). Mixed-effect linear models were fit to determine the relationship between province and use of different classes of antimicrobials. On average, for every 100 animals on the farm, 117 DCD of antimicrobials were administered per year (IQR: 55, 158). These treatments amounted to 623 DDD / 100 animal-yr (IQR: 302, 677 DDD/100 animal-years). Penicillins were the most used class of antimicrobials, followed by first-and third-generation cephalosporins. Farms in Ontario used more third-generation cephalosporins than other provinces. The second part of this study compared AMU in 2020 to previously reported Canadian studies through a meta-analysis. A GCA was conducted in 2007-2008 in Alberta, Ontario, Québec, and the Maritime provinces (Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia); another GCA was conducted in Québec in 2018. Overall, AMU was lower in 2018-2020 than in 2007-2008, with the exception of third-generation cephalosporin use, which increased.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: In February 2021, over one hundred scientists and policy experts participated in a web-based Workshop to discuss the ways that divergent evaluations of evidence and scientific uncertainties are used to delay timely protection of human health and the environment from exposures to hazardous agents. The Workshop arose from a previous workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on 'Late Lessons from Early Warnings' (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those agents. RESULTS: Workshop participants used recent case studies including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency - Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations, which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public's health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence of financial conflicts of interest. CONCLUSION: The recommendations should enhance the production of "actionable evidence," that is, reliable evaluations of the scientific evidence to support timely actions to protect health and environments from exposures to hazardous agents. The recommendations are applicable to policy and regulatory settings at the local, state, federal and international levels.},

  abstract={This review provides a comprehensive overview of the occurrence, fate, treatment and multi-criteria analysis of microplastics (MPs) and organic contaminants (OCs) in biosolids. A meta-analysis was complementarily analysed through the literature to map out the occurrence and fate of MPs and 10 different groups of OCs. The data demonstrate that MPs (54.7% occurrence rate) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants (44.2% occurrence rate) account for the highest prevalence of contaminants in biosolids. In turn, dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs) have the lowest rates (<0.01%). The occurrence of several OCs (e.g., dioxin, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceutical and personal care products, ultraviolet filters, phosphate flame retardants) in Europe appear at higher rates than in Asia and the Americas. However, MP concentrations in biosolids from Australia are reported to be 10 times higher than in America and Europe, which required more measurement data for in-depth analysis. Amongst the OC groups, brominated flame retardants exhibited exceptional sorption to biosolids with partitioning coefficients (log K(d)) higher than 4. To remove these contaminants from biosolids, a wide range of technologies have been developed. Our multicriteria analysis shows that anaerobic digestion is the most mature and practical. Thermal treatment is a viable option; however, it still requires additional improvements in infrastructure, legislation, and public acceptance.},

  abstract={Children's heightened susceptibility to environmental exposure arises from their underdeveloped detoxification mechanisms and augmented per-unit body-weight absorption capacity for chemical compounds. Primary teeth are an emerging biomatrix, which aid in storing crucial data on early exposure to harmful substances and developmental illnesses. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the association between environmental chemical exposure and health outcomes in children and adolescents using primary teeth as a matrix. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023428013). The review spanned studies published between 1974 and 2023, identified through an extensive literature search on databases like MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, the Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialized Register, Scopus, and Web of Science. Distiller SR software was used to assess study quality and extract the outcome data. The NTP-OHAT scale assessed evidence quality, and case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies in English were included. Comprehensively reviewing 5287 articles resulted in 29 studies being included in the final analysis, comprising 15 cross-sectional, seven case-control, and seven cohort studies. All 29 studies qualified for qualitative analysis. Eleven studies analyzed lead (Pb) effects on health outcomes, four analyzed manganese (Mn), and 14 investigated other element groups. Primary teeth biomatrix assessed various health outcomes: neurobehavior, childhood behaviour, ADHD, birth outcomes, fetal alcohol syndrome disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and dental caries. This study contributes to existing evidence, reinforcing a link between environmental metal exposure and health consequences. The evidence extends to prenatal and postnatal periods, substantiated by primary teeth biomatrix analysis. Lead level fluctuations can influence neuropsychological functioning, potentially causing cognitive impairments. Altered manganese levels correlate with behavioral issues, adverse effects on visuospatial development, and birth weight changes. Primary teeth biomatrices aid fetal alcohol spectrum disorders diagnosis, and correlations between organo-chemical exposure and autism were observed.},

The toxicity of PFAS on functional traits of fish exposed to PFAS was analyzed based on Meta-analysis combined with effect sizes, which provided reference for the toxicity assessment of PFAS and was conducive to the priority control and management of PFAS pollution. The results showed that:① of the 12 functional traits studied, seven were found to be vulnerable in fish; the order of toxicity response was malformation (lnRR=-2.5599), development (lnRR=-0.4103), cell damage (lnRR=-0.3962), reproduction (lnRR=-0.3724), thyroid response (lnRR=-0.2492), growth (lnRR=-0.2194), and survival (lnRR=-0.2192). ② The aquatic toxicity of PFAS was significantly affected by the sex and developmental stage of fish. PFAS tended to have adverse effects on female fish (lnRR=-0.1628), and the physiological function of embryos was most significantly affected by PFAS (lnRR=-0.3553). ③ A total of 13 PFAS were involved in the study, among which PFAS with sulfonate groups and long-chains were more likely to have significant toxicity to the functional traits of fish (P<0.05).④ Existing data revealed that PFAS tended to produce acute toxicity to fish at medium and low concentrations (0.01-10 mg·L(-1), P<0.05).},

  abstract={The fallopian tubes (FTs) are part of the female upper genital tract. The healthy FT provides the biological environment for successful fertilization and facilitates the subsequent movement of the conceptus to the endometrial cavity. However, when the FT is damaged, as with salpingitis, pyosalpinx, and hydrosalpinx, it may increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition. Decidualization refers to a multifactorial process by which the endometrium changes to permit blastocyst implantation. The decidualization reaction is vital for endometrial receptivity during the window of implantation. To date, no comprehensive review that collates evidence on decidualization in the human FT has been conducted. Therefore, the aim of this review is to compile the current evidence on cellular decidualization occurring in the healthy and pathological FT in women of reproductive age. A literature search was conducted using five databases and identified 746 articles, 24 of which were analyzed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The available evidence indicates that the FT are able to undergo decidual changes under specific circumstances; however, the exact mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which decidualization can occur in the FT.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Selective nerve root block has been widely used to treat degenerative disc disease (DDD), but no detailed research data is provided to compare the efficacy of epidural injection of anesthetics with or without steroids on the DDD treatment. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to  provide the first comparison of steroids + local anesthetic (LA) or LA alone for the treatment of DDD. STUDY DESIGN: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the clinical efficacy of both the steroids + LA group and the LA alone group, and subgroup analysis was also adopted. SETTING: A systematic review and meta-analysis using a random effects model on randomized controlled studies (RCTs). METHODS: After reviewing titles, abstracts, risk of bias, and full texts of 15,889 studies that were chosen following removal of duplicates after the initial database search, finally, 19 RCTs were included. Pain rating, functional score, follow-up period, and other-related data were extracted from these included works, and the effect size and statistical significance were calculated by the random effects model. The quality and level of the derived evidence were assessed by means of the  Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. RESULTS: In terms of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at one year, the combination of steroids + LA was obviously superior to LA. Subgroup analysis suggested that the combination of steroids + LA was more effective than LA alone in regard to the ODI in the lumbar group within 2 years. The opioids intake of patients treated by LA alone was less than that of the steroids + LA group within 3 months, and LA alone was more effective in pain score reduction, with more than 50% within 6 months in the interlaminar injection group. However, the combination of steroids + LA was more effective when alleviating the NRS-11 within 18 months in the caudal injection group. LIMITATIONS: Firstly, this analysis was inconsistent in technique, dosage, injection frequency, and follow-up period of epidural injections. Such differences may compromise the reported efficacy. Secondly, adverse reactions arising out of the 2 groups were not examined in that the included RCTs did not provide the data. Thirdly, different injection methods would compromise the outcomes, and no subgroup analysis was performed on different injection methods. Finally, these included articles that were mainly sourced from Manchikanti's team, and thus biased to some extent. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of steroids to anesthetic injectates was associated with a better NRS-11 and ODI compared with LA alone within one year in patients with DDD. Furthermore, the improvement of the ODI was observed within 2 years in patients with lumbar DDD.}

  abstract={Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widespread pollutants that may impact youth adiposity patterns. We investigated cross-sectional associations between PFAS and body mass index (BMI) in teenagers/adolescents across nine European countries within the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative. We used data from 1957 teenagers (12-18 yrs) that were part of the HBM4EU aligned studies, consisting of nine HBM studies (NEBII, Norway; Riksmaten Adolescents 2016-17, Sweden; PCB cohort (follow-up), Slovakia; SLO CRP, Slovenia; CROME, Greece; BEA, Spain; ESTEBAN, France; FLEHS IV, Belgium; GerES V-sub, Germany). Twelve PFAS were measured in blood, whilst weight and height were measured by field nurse/physician or self-reported in questionnaires. We assessed associations between PFAS and age- and sex-adjusted BMI z-scores using linear and logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. Random-effects meta-analysis and mixed effects models were used to pool studies. We assessed mixture effects using molar sums of exposure biomarkers with toxicological/structural similarities and quantile g-computation. In all studies, the highest concentrations of PFAS were PFOS (medians ranging from 1.34 to 2.79 μg/L). There was a tendency for negative associations with BMI z-scores for all PFAS (except for PFHxS and PFHpS), which was borderline significant for the molar sum of [PFOA and PFNA] and significant for single PFOA [β-coefficient (95% CI) per interquartile range fold change = -0.06 (-0.17, 0.00) and -0.08 (-0.15, -0.01), respectively]. Mixture assessment indicated similar negative associations of the total mixture of [PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS] with BMI z-score, but not all compounds showed associations in the same direction: whilst [PFOA, PFNA and PFOS] were negatively associated, [PFHxS] associated positively with BMI z-score. Our results indicated a tendency for associations of relatively low PFAS concentrations with lower BMI in European teenagers. More prospective research is needed to investigate this potential relationship and its implications for health later in life.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Oral health impacts systemic health, individual well-being, and quality of life. It is important to identify conditions that may exacerbate oral disease to aid public health and policy development and promote targeted patient treatment strategies. Developmental defects can increase an individual's risk of dental caries, hypersensitivity, premature tooth wear, erosion, and poor aesthetics. As part of an ongoing study assessing oral health in adults with cystic fibrosis at Cork University Dental School and Hospital, a systematic review of available literature was conducted to assess the prevalence of enamel defects in people with cystic fibrosis. AIMS: To critically evaluate the literature to determine if the prevalence of developmental defects of enamel is higher in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). METHODS: Data Sources: Three online databases were searched Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection. Studies that examined an association between cystic fibrosis and developmental defects of enamel were included in this systematic review. RESULTS: The initial search identified 116 publications from the following databases Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus. Eleven studies were included for qualitative analysis. Nine studies concluded that PwCF had a higher prevalence of enamel defects than control people and one study found no difference in cystic fibrosis (CF) status. All studies had a risk of bias that may influence study results and their interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the systematic review show a consistent pattern that PwCF have a higher prevalence of DDE than people without CF. Genetic dysfunction, chronic systemic infections, and long-term antibiotic use are possible aetiological causes. This review highlights the need for future studies to investigate if DDEs are caused by the underlying CFTR mutation or as a consequence of disease manifestations and/or management.},

  abstract={STUDY DESIGN: Systematic review. OBJECTIVE: Examine the clinical evidence for the use of osteobiologics in hybrid surgery (combined anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and total disc replacement (TDR)) in patients with multilevel cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD). METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched between January 2000 and August 2020. Clinical studies investigating 18-80 year old patients with multilevel cervical DDD who underwent hybrid surgery with or without the use of osteobiologics were considered eligible. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed the identified articles. The methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) tool and the risk of bias (RoB 2.0) assessment tool were used to assess risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) was used to evaluate quality of evidence across studies per outcome. RESULTS: Eleven studies were included. A decrease in cervical range of motion was observed in most studies for both the hybrid surgery and the control groups consisting of stand-alone ACDF or TDR. Fusion rates of 70-100% were reported in both the hybrid surgery and control groups consisting of stand-alone ACDF. The hybrid surgery group performed better or comparable to the control group in terms of adjacent segment degeneration. Studies reported an improvement in visual analogue scale for pain and neck disability index values after surgery compared to preoperative scores for both treatment groups. The included studies had moderate methodological quality. CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence for assessing the use of osteobiologics in multilevel hybrid surgery and additional high quality and controlled research is deemed essential.},

  abstract={PURPOSE: Surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) requires a careful choice of fusion levels. The usual recommendation for the selection of the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) for double major or thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L) curves falls on L3 or L4. The aim of the present study is to assess if the spinal fusion with LIV selection of L3 or L4 in AIS patients has a clinical or radiological impact in terms of degenerative disc disease (DDD) in distal unfused segments at long-term follow-up. METHODS: A systematic search of electronic databases from eligible articles was conducted. Only studies regarding long-term follow-up of AIS patients treated with spinal fusion were included. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were extracted and summarized. Meta-analysis on long-term follow-up MRI studies was performed. p value < 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Fourteen studies were included, for a total of 1264 patients. Clinical assessment of included patients showed a slight tendency to have worse clinical outcomes if spinal fusion is extended to L4 rather than L3. Despite that, meta-analysis could not be performed on clinical parameters because of heterogeneity of evaluated PROMs in included studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation at long-term follow-up showed no significant difference in terms of disc degeneration rate at overall meta-analysis (p = 0.916) between patients fused to L3 and L4. CONCLUSION: The LIV selection of L3 rather than L4, according to current literature, does not prevent disc degeneration in distal unfused segments over the long term. Long-term studies of patients treated with contemporary spinal instrumentation are needed.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVE: The purpose of the current study is to synthesize the outcomes of investigations reporting the odds of lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD) in competitive swimmers compared to controls. LITERATURE SURVEY: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines from inception until March 2023 to identify relevant studies evaluating the risk for lumbar DDD associated with swimming. METHODS: Data in the current literature were synthesized for positive imaging findings of DDD at one or more lumbar level in swimmers compared to nonswimmers. Additionally, data regarding prevalence of lumbar disc degeneration and back pain in competitive swimmers were synthesized. SYNTHESIS: Four studies were included in the final analysis. Study quality and risk of bias were deemed adequate. There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I(2)  = 0.74) regarding data collected, population of swimmers, sample size, and methods. Therefore, a meta-analysis was not conducted. The majority of the studies included in this study (three of four) reported that swimmers have increased odds of developing lumbar DDD. Additionally, secondary outcome analysis indicated that swimmers have a higher probability of developing moderate-to-severe back pain. CONCLUSION: Competitive swimming appears to be associated with the presence of DDD on advanced imaging and moderate-to-severe back pain. These findings are limited by significant differences in study methodology in the included studies. Although swimming is conventionally considered a low-impact sport, elite swimmers risk developing lower back pain and disc pathology, possibly because training involves unique biomechanics with repetitive rotational and hyperextension/flexion of the spine. Further research investigating risk factors involving biomechanics of swimming on the spine may have important implications for stroke technique, injury prevention, and rehabilitation for swimmers.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Inappropriate antibiotic use contributes significantly to the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance. While government-initiated population-level interventions are fundamental in addressing this issue, their full potential remains to be explored. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing inappropriate antibiotic use among antibiotic providers and users in healthcare and community settings. METHODS: We will conduct a systematic literature search across multiple databases and grey literature sources. We will include studies which evaluate the effectiveness of population-level interventions to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in healthcare and community settings in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries. This includes government-initiated measures targeting antibiotic use through education, restriction, incentivization, coercion, training, persuasion, context modification, behavior modeling, or barrier reduction. Two reviewers will independently perform screening to select eligible studies, followed by data extraction. The outcomes of interest are various measures of antibiotic prescription and consumption, such as Defined Daily Dose (DDD) or number of prescriptions per year. We anticipate including a broad range of study designs and outcome measures. Therefore, we will narratively synthesize results using the categories of the population-level policy interventions of the Behavior Change Wheel Framework. We will organize outcome data by economic contexts, target populations, and implementation settings. DISCUSSION: This review will strengthen the evidence base for the use of population-level interventions to address inappropriate antibiotic use. Drawing lessons from global experiences, the findings will provide valuable guidance to health policymakers, public health authorities, and researchers on tailoring interventions to specific economic contexts, populations, and settings, thereby enhancing their capacity to drive substantial improvement in appropriate antibiotic use.},

PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases were searched from their inception until December 2022 to identify studies that compared PFNA and DHS in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures. Two investigators independently screened the retrieved studies to assess their quality and verify their eligibility for inclusion. Meta-analyses were performed with RevMan 5.4 software. Thirty studies, including 3158 patients, met the inclusion criteria. These studies included 1574 patients treated with PFNA, and 1584 were treated with DHS. The findings of the meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction in the incidence of SSI in patients treated with PFNA compared with those treated with DHS (2.64% vs 6.76%, odds ratio [OR]: 0.40, 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 0.28-0.57, P < .001), superficial SSI (2.58% vs 5.01%, OR: 0.53, 95% CIs: 0.33-0.85, P = .008) and deep SSI (1.26% vs 3.43%, OR: 0.41, 95% CIs: 0.19-0.92, P = .03). PFNA was more effective than DHS in reducing the incidence of SSI. Even so, significant variations in sample sizes among the included studies meant that the methodology for some studies had qualitative deficiencies. Therefore, additional studies with large sample sizes are needed to validate these results.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous chemicals in the environment and our daily lives. Several epidemiological studies have revealed that PFAS exposure is linked to male sex hormone levels; however, the conclusions are inconsistent across studies. Consequently, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the association between PFAS exposure and male sex hormones. METHODS: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standards were followed during the meta-analysis. PubMed, Wed of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases were used to identify suitable articles before June 2023. The 95% CI and β values were calculated to assess the association between male sex hormone levels and PFAS exposure. Heterogeneity among the included studies was tested using inconsistency statistics (I(2)). RESULTS: The literature search identified 12 published articles that met our search criteria, involving 7506 participants. Our results revealed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposures were negatively correlated with testosterone (β = -0.05; 95% CI: -0.09, -0.02, P = 0.003) and (β = -0.04; 95% CI: -0.08, 0.00, P = 0.049), respectively. CONCLUSION: Exposure to PFNA and PFOA is negatively correlated with changes in male testosterone levels. This correlation suggests that we need to pay attention in the future to whether they are potential risk factors for male reproductive health.},

  abstract={The exposure of farmers to pesticides due to inadequate safety measures is a concern in low-income countries in Africa and Asia. However, until now, there have been limited studies on the farmers' risk due to pesticide application to fruit crops. The knowledge of farmers' exposure related to pesticide use and their safety practices was studied among 100 banana farmers in three areas (Padampur, Jagatpur, and Thimura) of Chitwan district, Nepal. More than 75% of the farmers complained about problems related to insects. Most frequently used insecticides in the area were chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Ten percent (10%) of the applied pesticides were highly hazardous to humans, according to the World Health Organization hazard category, with skin rash being the most common acute symptom reported by 29% of the farmers. Banned organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, such as endosulfan and triazophos, respectively, are still being used by farmers in the aforementioned areas. Spearman's correlation analysis revealed the lack of knowledge and safety practices among farmers leading to inadequate awareness related to the negative effects of pesticide use on human health and the environment. Therefore, government extension service can play a crucial role in improving banana farmers' knowledge of the toxic effects of pesticides as well as enforcing the Nepali language in the labeling of pesticide containers and packages.},

Goretex® (GTX) (n=1259) was the most frequently employed patch followed by Surgisis® (n=164), Dualmesh® (n=114), Marlex®/GTX® (n=56), Tutoplast dura® (n=40), Dacron® (n=34), Dacron®/GTX® (n=32), Permacol® (n=24), Teflon® (n=24), Surgisis®/GTX® (n=15), Sauvage® Filamentous Fabric (n=13), Marlex® (n=9), Alloderm® (n=8), Silastic® (n=4), Collagen coated Vicryl® mesh (CCVM) (n=1), Mersilene® (n=1), and MatriStem® (n=1) Biomaterials were further subgrouped as: Synthetic non-resorbable (SNOR) (n=1458), Natural-resorbable (NR) (n=249), Combined natural and synthetic non-resorbable (NSNOR) (n=103), and Combined natural and synthetic resorbable (NSR) (n=1). Overall recurrence rate for patch repair was 16.8% (n=305). For patch types with n>20, recurrence rate was lowest in GTX/Marlex (3.6%), followed by Teflon (4.2%), Dacron (5.6%), GTX (13.8%), Permacol (16.0%), Tutoplast Dura (17.5%), Dualmesh (20.2%), SIS/GTX (26.7%), SIS (36.6%), and Dacron/GTX (37.5%).When analysed by biomaterial groups, recurrence was highest in NSR (100%), followed by NR (32.9%), NSNOR (17.5) and SNOR the least (14.0%). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, over one-third of CDH were closed using patches. To date, 19 patch types/variations have been employed for CDH closure. GTX is the most popular, employed in 70% of patients; however excluding smaller cohorts (n<20) GTX/Marlex is associated with the lowest recurrence rate (3.6%). SNOR was the material type least associated with recurrence while NSR experienced recurrence in every instance.},

  abstract={Many human diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases, autism and diabetes are associated with exposure to pesticides, especially organochlorine pesticides. However, pesticide exposure is also associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the leading cause of death worldwide. In this systematic review, results on the link between organochlorine pesticide pollution and CVD were collected from databases (Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Science Direct) in May 2022 from studies published between 2010 and 2022. A total of 24 articles were selected for this systematic review. Sixteen articles were extracted by reviewers using a standardized form that included cross-sectional, cohort, and ecological studies that reported exposure to organochlorine pesticides in association with increased CVD risk. In addition, eight articles covering molecular mechanisms organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on cardiovascular effects were retrieved for detailed evaluation. Based on the findings of the study, it seems elevated circulating levels of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs increase the risk of coronary heart disease, especially in early life exposure to these pesticides and especially in men. Changes in the regulatory function of peroxisome proliferator-activated γ receptor (PPARγ), reduction of paroxonase activity (PON1), epigenetic changes of histone through induction of reactive oxygen species, vascular endothelial inflammation with miR-expression 126 and miR-31, increased collagen synthesis enzymes in the extracellular matrix and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and fibrosis are mechanisms by which PCBs increase the risk of CVD. According to this systematic review, organochlorine pesticide exposure is associated with increased risk of CVD and CVD mortality through the atherogenic and inflammatory molecular mechanism involving fatty acid and glucose metabolism.},

  abstract={Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are deemed major conveyors and point sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to the environment. This statistical meta-analysis of existing literature from the past 15 years focused on the significance of treatment type for PFAS removal efficiencies and the influence of PFAS sources (domestic vs. industrial) on their removal. Different sampling events, WWTPs across the world, different treatment technologies, configurations, and processes, as well as different PFAS classes and compounds were considered. This study evaluated 13 PFAS analyzed predominantly in 161 WWTPs across the world. The statistical test results revealed that these 13 frequently detected and reported PFAS can be divided into four groups based on their behavior during wastewater treatment, namely (1) C6-10 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), (2) C4,5,11,12 PFCAs, (3) C4,6,8 perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and (4) C10 PFSA. In this study, biological treatments such as (1) membrane bioreactors, (2) combination of two or more biological treatments, and (3) biofilm processes revealed the highest PFAS removals, although the addition of a tertiary treatment actually had a nonbeneficial effect on PFAS removal. Moreover, a strong statistical correlation was observed between industrial wastewater sources and the presence of high influent PFAS concentrations in the receiving WWTPs. This indicates that industrial sources were the main contributors of the PFAS load in the analyzed WWTPs. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2024;20:59-69. © 2023 The Authors.

  abstract={BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been shown to be persistent and bioaccumulative. An elevated danger of pregnancy complications perhaps connected with exposure to PFASs, but the potential effects remain elusive. The objective of this study is to investigate the possible association between PFASs exposure and pregnancy complications, drawing upon existing evidence. METHODS: Electronic databases of PubMed, Qvid Medline, Embase, and Web of Science were searched thoroughly to identify eligible research published prior to November 28, 2023, examining the relationship between PFASs and pregnancy-related complications. To evaluate the quality of observational studies incorporated into the article, the Strengthening Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) tool was utilized. The main outcomes assessed in this study included gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), gestational hypertension (GH), and preeclampsia (PE). RESULTS: Twenty-five relevant studies involving 30079 participants were finally selected from four databases. The combined estimates indicate that prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and perfluoroenanthic acid (PFHpA) is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (PFOA: OR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.07-1.94, P = 0.015; PFHxS: OR = 1.16, 95%CI: 1.00-1.36, P = 0.055; PFBS: OR = 1.44, 95%CI: 1.16-1.79, P = 0.001; PFHpA: OR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.10-1.82, P = 0.008). The exposure to PFBS is positively associated with HDP (OR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.14-1.41, P < 0.001), while both PFOA and PFHpA demonstrate statistically significant positive correlations with GH (PFOA: OR = 1.09, 95%CI: 1.00-1.19, P = 0.049; PFHpA: OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.15-1.78, P = 0.001). Negative correlations were observed for prenatal perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) exposure and GH (OR = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87, P = 0.001). However, no compelling evidence was identified to link PFASs exposure with the risk of PE. CONCLUSION: According to the meta-analysis findings, exposure to PFASs may be linked to GDM, HDP, and GH, but it does not significantly raise the risk of PE alone. Further research with larger sample size is required to verify this potential association and explore the biological mechanisms.},

The results showed that among studies conducted on VOCs, the concentration of tetrachloroethylene, m,p-xylene, and toluene were at the top in water matrices, and the lowest average concentrations were found in chloroform, anthracene, and butyl benzyl phthalate. In terms of VOC concentrations in water matrices, China was the most polluted country. Moreover, the data analysis indicated that China was the only country with carcinogenic risk. A Monte-Carlo simulation showed that although the averages obtained were comparable to the acceptable limits, for heptachlor, the maximum carcinogenic risk is achieved at a level that is slightly over the limit, only 25% from the population being exposed.},

OBJECTIVES: To systematically review the clinical outcomes, re-operation, and complication rates of lumbar TDR devices at mid-to long-term follow-up studies for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD). METHODS: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar to identify follow-up studies that evaluated clinical outcomes of lumbar TDR in patients with DDD. The included studies met the following criteria: prospective or retrospective studies published from 2012 to 2022; a minimum of 5 years post-operative follow-up; a study sample size >10 patients; patients >18 years of age; containing clinical outcomes with Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), complication or reoperation rates. RESULTS: Twenty-two studies were included with data on 2284 patients. The mean follow-up time was 8.30 years, with a mean follow-up rate of 86.91%. The study population was 54.97% female, with a mean age of 42.34 years. The mean VAS and ODI pain score improvements were 50.71 ± 6.91 and 30.39 ± 5.32 respectively. The mean clinical success and patient satisfaction rates were 74.79% ± 7.55% and 86.34% ± 5.64%, respectively. The mean complication and reoperation rates were 18.53% ± 6.33% and 13.6% ± 3.83%, respectively. There was no significant difference when comparing mid-term and long-term follow-up studies for all clinical outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: There were significant improvements in pain reduction at last follow-up in patients with TDRs. Mid-term follow-up data on clinical outcomes, complication and reoperation rates of lumbar TDRs were maintained longer term.},

  abstract={Pollution caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a significant concern. This concern has become more problematic given the rapid modification of PAHs in the environment during co-contamination to form substituted PAHs. This review aims to integrate bibliometric analysis with a rigorous study of mechanistic insights, resulting in a more comprehensive knowledge of evolving research trends on PAH remediation. The results show that research in this field has progressed over the years and peaked in 2022, potentially due to the redirection of resources toward emerging pollutants, hinting at the dynamic nature of environmental research priorities. During this year, 158,147 documents were published, representing 7 % of the total publications in the field between 2000 and 2023. The different remediation methods used for PAH remediation were identified and compared. Bioremediation, having >90 % removal efficiency, has been revealed to be the best technique because it is cost-effective and easy to operate at large scale in situ and ex-situ. The current challenges in PAH remediation have been detailed and discussed. Implementing innovative and sustainable technologies that target pollutant removal and valuable compound recovery is necessary to build a more robust future for water management.},

  abstract={PURPOSE: To assess efficacy and safety outcomes of subretinal fluid drainage methods during pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) for rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD). METHODS: A systematic search strategy was conducted of studies published between January 2000 and October 2022. Included studies reported on either the safety or efficacy of two or more drainage methods during PPV for RRD patients. RESULTS: Two randomized and five observational studies consisting of 1524 eyes were included. Best corrected visual acuity at last study observation and primary reattachment rate were similar across groups. A significantly lower risk of epiretinal membrane formation (ERM) was associated with draining subretinal fluid through pre-existing retinal breaks (PRB) (RR= 0.70, 95% CI=[0.60, 0.83], p=<0.01, I2=0%) or with perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) (RR=0.70, 95% CI=[0.59, 0.83], p=<0.01, I2=0%) compared to posterior retinotomy (PR). The risk of an abnormal foveal contour was significantly greater in PFCL-treated eyes relative to PR (RR=1.56, 95% CI=[1.13, 2.17], p=<0.01, I2=0%). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed in final BCVA at last study observation and primary reattachment rates across different drainage methods. There remains limited information on the topic and future research is warranted.},

  abstract={The main component of chocolate, cocoa (Theobroma cacao), is a significant commercial agricultural plant that directly sustains the livelihoods of an estimated forty to fifty million people. The economies of many cocoa producing nations, particularly those in the developing world, are supported by cocoa export revenue. To ensure satisfactory yields, however, the plant is usually intensely treated with pesticides because it is vulnerable to disease and pest attacks. Even though pesticides help protect the cocoa plant, unintended environmental contamination is also likely. Honey, produced from nectar obtained by honeybees from flowers while foraging, can serve as a good indicator for the level of pesticide residues and environmental pesticide build-up in landscapes. Here, we use a systematic literature review to quantify the extent of research on residues of pesticides used in cocoa cultivation in honey. In 81% of the 104 studies examined for this analysis, 169 distinct compounds were detected. Imidacloprid was the most frequently detected pesticide, making neonicotinoids the most frequently found class of pesticides overall. However, in cocoa producing countries, organophosphates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids were the most frequently detected pesticides. Interestingly, only 19% of studies were carried out in cocoa producing countries. We recommend prioritizing more research in the countries that produce cocoa to help to understand the potential impact of pesticide residues linked with cocoa cultivation in honey and the environment more generally to inform better pesticide usage, human health, and environmental policies.},

  abstract={Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous emerging pollutants that have been found in the marine, freshwater, air, and soil environments. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in releasing MPs to the environment. Therefore, understanding the occurrence, fate, and removal mechanism of MPs in WWTPs is of great importance towards microplastic control. In this review, the occurrence characteristics and removal rates of MPs in 78 WWTPs from 57 studies were discussed based on Meta-analysis. Specifically, the key aspects regarding MPs removal in WWTPs, such as wastewater treatment processes and MPs shapes, sizes, and polymer compositions were analyzed and compared. The results showed that:① the abundances of MPs in the influent and effluent were 1.56×10(-2)-3.14×10(4) n·L(-1) and 1.70×10(-3)-3.09×10(2) n·L(-1), respectively. The abundance of MPs in the sludge ranged from 1.80×10(-1) to 9.38×10(3) n·g(-1). ② The total removal rate (>90%) of MPs by WWTPs using oxidation ditch, biofilm, and conventional activated sludge treatment processes was higher than that using sequencing batch activated sludge, anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic, and anoxic-aerobic processes. ③ The removal rate of MPs in primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment process were 62.87%, 55.78%, and 58.45%, respectively. The combination process of "grid+ sedimentation tank+primary sedimentation tank" had the highest removal rate towards MPs in primary treatment processes, and the membrane bioreactor had the highest one beyond other secondary treatment processes. Filtration was the best process in tertiary treatment. ④ The film, foam, and fragment MPs were easier to remove (>90%) than fiber and spherical (<90%) MPs by WWTPs. The MPs with particle size larger than 0.5 mm were easier to remove than those with particle size smaller than 0.5 mm. The removal efficiencies of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polypropylene (PP) MPs were higher than 80%.},

  abstract={The rise in the global population demands an increasing food supply and methods to boost agricultural production. Pesticides are necessary for agricultural production models, avoiding losses of close to 40%. Nevertheless, the extensive use of pesticides can cause their accumulation in the environment, causing problems for human health, biota, and ecosystems. Thus, new technologies have emerged to remove these wastes efficiently. In recent years, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) have been reported as promising catalysts to degrade pesticides; however, a systematic understanding of their effect on pesticide degradation is still required. Therefore, this study focused on a meta-analysis of articles available in Elsevier's Scopus and Thomas Reuters Web of Science, found by searching for "nanoparticle pesticide" and "pesticide contamination." After passing different filters, the meta-analysis was performed with 408 observations from 94 reviews, which comprise insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, including organophosphates, organochlorines, carbamates, triazines, and neonicotinoids. Herein, 14 different MNPs (Ag, Ni, Pd, Co(3)O(4), BiOBr, Au, ZnO, Fe, TiO(2), Cu, WO(3), ZnS, SnO(2), and Fe(0)), improved pesticide degradation, with the highest degradation rates achieved by Ag (85%) and Ni (82.5%). Additionally, the impact of the MNP functionalization, size, and concentration on pesticide degradation was quantified and compared. In general, the degradation rate increased when the MNPs were functionalized (~ 70%) compared to naked (~ 49%). Also, the particle size significantly affected the degradation of pesticides. To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis performed about the impact of MNPs on pesticide degradation, providing an essential scientific basis for future studies.},

  abstract={OBJECTIVES: Initiatives to curb hospital antibiotic use might be associated with harm from under-treatment. We examined the extent to which variation in hospital antibiotic prescribing is associated with mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. METHODS: This ecological analysis examined Hospital Episode Statistics from 36,124,372 acute/general medicine admissions (≥16y) to 135 acute hospitals in England, 01/April/2010-31/March/2017. Random-effects meta-regression was used to investigate whether heterogeneity in adjusted 30-day mortality was associated with hospital-level antibiotic use, measured in defined-daily-doses (DDD)/1,000 bed-days. Models also considered DDDs/1,000 admissions and DDDs for narrow-spectrum/broad-spectrum antibiotics, parenteral/oral, and local interpretations of World Health Organization Access, Watch, and Reserve antibiotics. RESULTS: Hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days varied 15-fold with comparable variation in broad-spectrum, parenteral, and Reserve antibiotic use. After extensive adjusting for hospital case-mix, the probability of 30-day mortality changed -0.010% (95% CI: -0.064,+0.044) for each increase of 500 hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days. Analyses of other metrics of antibiotic use showed no consistent association with mortality risk. CONCLUSIONS: We found no evidence that wide variation in hospital antibiotic use is associated with adjusted mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Using low-prescribing hospitals as benchmarks could help drive safe and substantial reductions in antibiotic consumption of up-to one-third in this population.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) versus dynamic hip screw (DHS) for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures, including the available evidence drawn from the literature. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted to identify available and relevant randomized controlled trials and retrospective comparative observational studies regarding PFNA compared against DHS in treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures in Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus Online up to February 12, 2022. Data from the included studies were extracted independently by 2 reviewers and analyzed using RevMan 5.3, and the quality of the studies was assessed. RESULTS: Five randomized controlled trials and 12 observational studies were recruited and met the inclusion criteria, which consisted of 1332 patients with PFNA and 1271 patients with DHS. The results of the meta-analysis showed that, compared with the DHS, PFNA exhibited a beneficial role in postoperative Harris Hip Scores, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, fracture healing time and full weight-bearing time, limb shortening, cutout, reoperation, union problems, the varus collapse of the femoral head/neck, and infection; however, DHS was superior to PFNA in hidden blood loss (relative risk [RR] = 139.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] [136.18, 143.43], P < .00001), postoperation drainage (RR = -17.85, 95% CI [-30.10, -5.60], P = .004), total blood loss (RR = 50.34, 95% CI [42.99, 57.69], P < .00001), and femoral shaft fracture (RR = 4.72, 95% CI [1.15, 19.32], P = .03) treated by DHS were significantly decreased, compared with those by PFNA; however, no significant differences were observed in tip-apex distance, fixation failures, screw migration, or other complicants between the 2 surgical methods. CONCLUSION: Analysis of a large number of relevant clinical indicators available shows that PFNA has better clinical manifestation than DHS in treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures.},

  abstract={Microplastics, as emerging pollutants, have become a global environmental concern. Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) are threatened by microplastics. Although substantial studies have explored the dynamics and threats of microplastics in BCEs, the fate and driving factors of microplastics in BCEs on a global scale remain largely unknown. Here, the occurrence, driving factors, and risks of microplastics in global BCEs were investigated by synthesizing a global meta-analysis. The results showed that the abundance of microplastics in BCEs has notable spatial differences worldwide, with the highest microplastic concentrations in Asia, especially in South and Southeast Asia. Microplastic abundance is influenced by the vegetation habitat, climate, coastal environment, and river runoff. The interaction of geographic location, ecosystem type, coastal environment, and climate enhanced the effects of microplastic distribution. In addition, we found that microplastic accumulation in organisms varied according to feeding habits and body weight. Significant accumulation was observed in large fish; however, growth dilution effects were also observed. The effect of microplastics on the organic carbon content of sediments from BCEs varies by ecosystem; microplastic concentrations do not necessarily increase organic carbon sequestration. Global BCEs are at a high risk of microplastic pollution, with high microplastic abundance and toxicity driving the high pollution risk. Finally, this review provides scientific evidence that will form the basis for future microplastic research, focusing on the transport of microplastics in BCEs; effects on the growth, development, and primary productivity of blue carbon plants; and soil biogeochemical cycles.},

We conducted a Before-After-Control-Intervention experiment by adding salmon carcasses and eggs to a Michigan (USA) stream that had never received inputs from non-native salmon to understand the bioaccumulation and persistence of biotransported contaminants. Our experimental outcomes were compared to previous studies using meta-analysis. Coincident with the introduction of salmon, the PCB and DDE burden of resident trout significantly increased. However, we did not observe changes in total mercury (Hg). Two years after the salmon addition experiment concluded, resident trout POP concentrations had returned to pre-addition levels, with no difference between the treatment and control reaches. Analysis of effect sizes suggested that the contaminant response observed in our experiment is consistent with field survey observations. Our study suggested that the consumption of salmon eggs drove the increase in POP burden of resident trout while Hg bioaccumulation was influenced by watershed sources. Critically, our study suggests that ecosystems are capable of quickly recovering from POP inputs from species migrations if contaminant sources are removed.},

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Observational studies or clinical trials were included if measured 25(OH)D serum levels in pregnant women and/or in their children (up to 3 years old) and evaluated the occurrence of DDD in the primary dentition of offspring associated with the low 25(OH)D levels. Literature reviews, case reports, laboratory and/or animals' studies, conference abstracts, letters to the editor, book chapters and clinical protocols were excluded. Searches were carried out in 6 electronic databases and in the gray literature until March 2023, without restrictions. The study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the certainty of the evidence by GRADE. Data were descriptively synthesized considering the association between DDD and 25(OH)D levels. RESULTS: Seven studies were included. Only developmental enamel defects (DED) were observed after examination of 6651 children. The incidence of DED ranged from 8.9% to 66%. Six studies found no association between low levels of 25(OH)D and DED. However, one reported correlation between hypomineralization of the primary second molar (HSMD) and low levels of 25(OH)D at birth. Methodological flaws were observed in all studies and the certainty of the evidence was very low. CONCLUSION: Although HSMD was the only DDD associated with low levels of 25(OH)D in children, the available evidence is still not conclusive. More robust studies are needed to endorse the biological plausibility of DDD in primary teeth due to low serum levels of 25(OH)D in pregnant women or in their children. FAPERJ financed this study, which was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42022357511).},

METHODS: A systematic search of 8 databases, namely PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Psycho info, China national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang, China science and technology journal database, and China biomedical literature database, was performed to find randomized controlled trials from inception to April 2023. Two reviewers critically and independently assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane Collaboration criteria and extracted correlated data using the designed form. All analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3. RESULTS: Ten studies were included in the systematic review, with a total of 830 patients (FTS group: 415; control group: 415). The results showed that different nursing measures based on the concept of FTS could significantly reduce anxiety (MD = -1.74, 95% confidence intervals [-2.41, -1.08], P < .00001) and depression (MD = -1.98, 95% confidence intervals [-2.44, -1.51], P < .00001) in patients after modified breast cancer surgery compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the concept of FTS, the nursing measures such as reducing preoperative fasting time, posture management, preventive analgesia, and early functional exercise can effectively reduce the anxiety and depression of patients during the perioperative period.},

  abstract={Biochar obtained from sewage sludge serves as a valuable soil amendment in agriculture, enhancing soil properties by increasing the nutrient content, cation exchange capacity, water retention, and oxygen transmission. However, its utilisation is hampered by the presence of micropollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Previous studies indicate that the type and amount of micropollutants can be significantly adjusted by selecting the right process parameters. This literature review provides an overview of how (1) pyrolysis temperature, (2) carrier gas flow and type, (3) heating rate, and (4) residence time affect the concentration of micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge. The micropollutants targeted are those listed by the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and by the International Biochar Institution (IBI), including PAHs, PCDD/Fs, PCBs and VOCs. In addition, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are also considered due to their presence in sewage sludge. The findings suggest that higher pyrolysis temperatures reduce micropollutant levels. Moreover, the injection of a carrier gas (N(2) or CO(2)) during the pyrolysis and cooling processes effectively lowers PAHs and PCDD/Fs, by reducing the contact of biochar with oxygen, which is crucial in mitigating micropollutants. Nevertheless, limited available data impedes an assessment of the impact of these parameters on PFAS in biochar. In addition, further research is essential to understand the effects of carrier gas type, heating rate, and residence time in order to determine the optimal pyrolysis process parameters for generating clean biochar.},

  abstract={INTRODUCTION: The impact of plastics on terrestrial ecosystems is receiving increasing attention. Although of great importance to soil biogeochemical processes, how plastics influence soil microbes have yet to be systematically studied. The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate whether plastics lead to divergent responses of soil microbial community parameters, and explore the potential driving factors. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 710 paired observations from 48 published articles to quantify the impact of plastic on the diversity, biomass, and functionality of soil microbial communities. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This study indicated that plastics accelerated soil organic carbon loss (effect size = -0.05, p = 0.004) and increased microbial functionality (effect size = 0.04, p = 0.003), but also reduced microbial biomass (effect size = -0.07, p < 0.001) and the stability of co-occurrence networks. Polyethylene significantly reduced microbial richness (effect size = -0.07, p < 0.001) while polypropylene significantly increased it (effect size = 0.17, p < 0.001). Degradable plastics always had an insignificant effect on the microbial community. The effect of the plastic amount on microbial functionality followed the "hormetic dose-response" model, the infection point was about 40 g/kg. Approximately 3564.78 μm was the size of the plastic at which the response of microbial functionality changed from positive to negative. Changes in soil pH, soil organic carbon, and total nitrogen were significantly positively correlated with soil microbial functionality, biomass, and richness (R(2) = 0.04-0.73, p < 0.05). The changes in microbial diversity were decoupled from microbial community structure and functionality. We emphasize the negative impacts of plastics on soil microbial communities such as microbial abundance, essential to reducing the risk of ecological surprise in terrestrial ecosystems. Our comprehensive assessment of plastics on soil microbial community parameters deepens the understanding of environmental impacts and ecological risks from this emerging pollution.},

  abstract={Endocrine disruptors (EDs) pose a serious threat to human health and the environment and require a comprehensive evaluation to be identified. The identification of EDs require a substantial amount of data, both in vitro and in vivo, due to the current scientific criteria in the EU. At the same time, the EU strives to reduce animal testing due to concerns regarding animal welfare and sensitivity of animal studies to adequately detect adverse effects relevant for human health. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) is a persistent organic pollutant that is suspected to be an ED based on academic research, however it is not identified as such from a regulatory perspective. It has previously been shown that PFOS has the potential to cause neurotoxicity as well as affect the thyroid system, and it is known that specific thyroid hormone levels are critical in the development of the brain during. In this work, the aim was to evaluate a mechanism-based approach to identify ED properties of PFOS based on the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework and using New Approach Methods (NAMs), by comparing this approach to an ED assessment based on the currently available guidance document. An AOP network (AOPN) was generated for the thyroid modality, and AOPs leading to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) were identified. A literature search and screening process based on the AOPN, and systematic review methodology, was performed, followed by a rigorous Weight-of-Evidence (WoE) assessment. Evidence was mapped back onto the AOPN used for the literature search, to identify possible endocrine Modes-of-Action (MoAs) for PFOS and data gaps in the two assessments. It could be concluded that PFOS fulfils the criteria for ED classification in the standard ED assessment, but not in the mechanism-based assessment. The need for quantitative information, such as quantitative AOPs, for the mechanism-based approach is discussed. The possibility of a directly neurotoxic alternative MoA was also highlighted based on available in vitro data. Opportunities and challenges with implementing AOPs and NAMs into the regulatory assessment of EDs, and assessing hazard in the Next Generation Risk Assessment, is discussed. This case study exploring the mechanism-based approach to ED identification represents an important step toward more accurate and predictive assessment of EDs based on AOPs and NAMs, and to the Next Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA) concept.},

  abstract={Owing to a wide range of advantages, such as stability, non-invasiveness, and ease of sampling, hair has been used progressively for comprehensive biomonitoring of organic pollutants for the last three decades. This has led to the development of new analytical and multi-class analysis methods for the assessment of a broad range of organic pollutants in various population groups, ranging from small-scale studies to advanced studies with a large number of participants based on different exposure settings. This meta-analysis summarizes the existing literature on the assessment of organic pollutants in hair in terms of residue levels, the correlation of hair residue levels with those of other biological matrices and socio-demographic factors, the reliability of hair versus other biomatrices for exposure assessment, the use of segmental hair analysis for chronic exposure evaluation and the effect of external contamination on hair residue levels. Significantly high concentrations of organic pollutants such as pesticides, flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were reported in human hair samples from different regions and under different exposure settings. Similarly, high concentrations of pesticides (from agricultural activities), flame retardants (E-waste dismantling activities), dioxins and furans were observed in various occupational settings. Moreover, significant correlations (p < 0.05) for hair and blood concentrations were observed in majority of studies featuring pesticides and flame retardants. While among sociodemographic factors, gender and age significantly affected the hair concentrations in females and children in general exposure settings, whereas adult workers in occupational settings. Furthermore, the assessment of the hair burden of persistent organic pollutants in domestic and wild animals showed high concentrations for pesticides such as HCHs and DDTs whereas the laboratory-based studies using animals demonstrated strong correlations between exposure dose, exposure duration, and measured organic pollutant levels, mainly for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, terbuthylazine, aldrin, dieldrin and pyrethroid metabolites. Considering the critical analysis of the results obtained from literature review, hair is regarded as a reliable matrix for organic pollutant assessment; however, some limitations, as discussed in this review, need to be overcome to reinforce the status of hair as a suitable matrix for exposure assessment.},

  abstract={The increasing prevalence of paraben compounds in the environment has given rise to concerns regarding their detrimental impacts on both ecosystems and human health. Over the past few decades, photocatalytic reactions have drawn significant attention as a method to accelerate the otherwise slow degradation of these pollutants. The current study aims to evaluate the current efficacy of the photocatalytic method for degrading parabens in aqueous solutions. An extensive literature review and bibliometric analysis were conducted to identify key research trends and influential areas in the field of photocatalytic paraben degradation. Studies were screened based on the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, which led to 13 studies that were identified as being appropriate for the meta-analysis using the random effects model. Furthermore, experimental parameters such as pH, paraben initial concentration, catalyst dosage, light intensity, and contact time have been reported to have key impacts on the performance of the photocatalytic degradation process. A comprehensive quantitative assessment of these parameters was carried out in this work. Overall, photocatalytic techniques could eliminate parabens with an average degradation efficiency of >80 %. The findings of the Egger's test and the Begg's test were statistically not significant suggesting potential publication bias was not observed. This review provides a holistic understanding of the photocatalytic degradation of parabens and is anticipated to encourage more widespread adoption of photocatalytic procedures as a suitable method for the elimination of parabens from aqueous solutions, opening new avenues for future research in this direction.},

  abstract={Present study focused on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) occurrence in dry and wet seasons in the middle and lower Yangtze River (YZR) and changing temporal trends after years of control. Results revealed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 75 % of total PFAS concentrations (∑(11)PFASs). ∑(11)PFASs were ranged 0.20-28.49 ng/L and 1.17-112.84 μg/kg in water and sediment. The logK(oc) of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids was positive with the carbon chain length (p < 0.05, r(2) = 0.78). A meta-analysis of results from 16 peer-reviewed publications about PFASs in the YZR showed that fluorochemical industries strongly influenced the high PFAS levels in the detected scenes. PFOA was still the primary pollutant. Individual PFAS in the lower reach was higher than those in the middle reach. The mass loading of PFASs imported into the sea was 10.80 t/y. This study will help develop effective approaches for controlling emerging pollutants in the YZR.},

  abstract={BACKGROUND: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has had an incomparable triumph in prenatal diagnostics in the last decade. Over 1400 research articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of this test. METHODS: The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects-mainly from a patient-perspective. RESULTS: A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? CONCLUSIONS: Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results.},

  abstract={To explore the relationship between perinatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and the male reproductive system of F3 generation, and to evaluate the toxicological effects of endocrine-disrupting chemicals on the reproductive system of F3 generation male rodents. PubMed and Web of Science databases were searched to obtain the studies; overall risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) were used to evaluate the relationship between exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals and reproductive system damage in F3 generation male rodents. Nine studies were included for analysis. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are significantly associated with the reproductive system of male rodents of F3 generation, especially the testis (RR = 3.13, 95% CI: 2.05, 4.76), prostate (RR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.27, 4.00), and kidney (RR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.77, 4.52), but the current analysis does not prove that EDCs are the adverse factors for puberty abnormalities. The results indicated that the overall associations between atrazine (RR = 3.06, 95% CI: 1.10, 8.51, P = 0.032), DDT (RR = 6.26, 95% CI: 1.56, 25.08, P = 0.010), pesticide and insect repellent mixture (permethrin and DEET) (RR = 2.23, 95% CI: 1.34, 3.69, P = 0.002), and vinclozolin (RR = 4.71, 95% CI: 2.74, 8.10, P = 0.000) and reproductive system damage in F3 generation male rodents were statistically significant. Our study indicated that EDCs have an atavistic effect on the male reproductive system, and we should pay attention to the long-term effects of environmental exposure to endocrine disruptors in future generations.},
