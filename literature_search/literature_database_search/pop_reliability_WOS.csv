We examined individual and mixture associations of PFAS on liver function biomarkers in a representative sample of Canadian adults. We explored the potential for effect modification by sex and body mass index, as well as by physical activity level which may attenuate the deleterious effect of PFAS on metabolic disorders. Methods We analyzed data from participants aged 20-74 from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. We used linear regression to examine associations between plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUDA on serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin. We used quantile g-computation to estimate associations with a PFAS mixture for each simultaneous, one-quartile change in PFAS concentrations. Results Each doubling of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, or PFNA concentrations was associated with higher AST, GGT, and ALP concentrations. Each doubling of PFOA concentrations was associated with 16.5% (95%CI: 10.4, 23.0) higher GGT concentrations among adults not meeting Canada's physical activity guidelines vs. 6.6% (95%CI: -1.6, 15.5) among those meeting these guidelines. Sex and BMI also modified some associations, though to a lesser extent. We did not observe associations between ALT and PFOA (1.2% change; 95%CI: -2.5, 4.9), PFOS (2.2% change; 95%CI: -0.8, 5.3), or PFHxS (1.5% change; 95%CI: -0.4, 3.4). We also did not observe consistent associations for PFDA and PFUDA or with total bilirubin. In quantile g-computation models, each simultaneous one-quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was positively associated with AST (7.5% higher; 95%CI: 4.0, 10.4), GGT (9.7% higher; 95%CI: 1.7, 17.0), and ALP (2.8% higher; 95%CI: 0.5, 5.4). Conclusion Higher plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA - both individually and as a mixture - were associated with higher serum concentrations of liver function biomarkers. These results contribute to emerging evidence suggesting that higher levels of physical activity appear to be protective against the hepatotoxic effects of PFOA. This work contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the hepatotoxic effects of PFAS.",,,,,"Liang, Chunlei/AAD-7042-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-069X,,,,SEP 14,2022,21,1,,,,,,,85,10.1186/s12940-022-00892-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12940-022-00892-6,,,,,,,,36104725,,,,,WOS:000853899400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Studies have shown that a single exposure to PFAS may provoke abnormal liver function; however, few studies have investigated the overall effect of PFAS mixtures. We aimed to investigate associations between exposure to PFAS mixtures and liver function indices and explore the relevant mechanisms. This study included 278 adult males from Guangzhou, China. Serum metabolite profiles were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. We applied weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression as well as Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to analyze the association of nine PFAS mixtures with 14 liver function indices. PFAS mixtures were positively associated with apolipoprotein B (APOB) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and negatively associated with direct bilirubin (DBIL) and total bilirubin (TBIL) in both the WQS and BKMR analyses. In addition, Spearman's correlation test showed individual PFAS correlated with APOB, GGT, TBIL, and DBIL, while there's little correlation between individual PFAS and other liver function indices. In linear regression analysis, PFHxS, PFOS, PFHpS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUdA were associated with APOB; PFOA, PFDA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFUdA were associated with GGT. Subsequently, a metabolome-wide association study and mediation analysis were combined to explore metabolites that mediate these associations. The mechanisms linking PFAS to APOB and GGT are mainly related with amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. High-dimensional mediation analysis showed that glycerophospholipids are the main markers of the association between PFAS and APOB, and that (R)-dihydromaleimide, Ile Leu, (R)-(+)-2pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, and L-glutamate are the main markers of the association between PFAS and GGT. In summary, overall associations between PFAS and specific indices of liver function were found using two statistical methods; the metabolic pathways and markers identified here may serve to prompt more detailed study in animal-based systems, as well as a similar detailed analysis in other populations.",,,,,"Chen, Yiran/JVZ-2621-2024","Chen, Yi-ran/0000-0002-4602-2454",,,,,,,,,,,,,0160-4120,1873-6750,,,,JAN,2024,183,,,,,,,,108405,10.1016/j.envint.2023.108405,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2023.108405,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38163401,,,,,WOS:001150814500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize associations between PFAS and blood lipids in adults.METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed and Web of Science for articles published through 13 May 2022 that examined associations between PFAS and blood lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triacylglycerols (TGs). Inclusion criteria included the presence of associations between five PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFDA, and PFNA) and four blood lipid measures (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TGs) in adults. Data on study characteristics and PFAS-lipid associations were extracted. Assessments of individual study quality were performed. Associations of changes of blood lipid levels corresponding to 1 interquartile range (IQR)-unit increase of blood PFAS levels were pooled using random effects models. Dose-response relationships were examined. RESULTS: Twenty-nine publications were included in the present analyses. Every IQR increase of PFOA was significantly associated with a 2.1-mg/dL increase in TC (95% CI: 1.2, 3.0), a 1.3-mg/dL increase in TGs (95% CI: 0.1, 2.4), and a 1.4-mg/dL increase in LDL-C (95% CI: 0.6, 2.2). PFOS was also significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels, and the corresponding values were 2.6 (95% CI: 1.5, 3.6) and 1.9 (95% CI: 0.9, 3.0), respectively. Associations of PFOS and PFOA with HDL-C levels were largely null. For minor PFAS species, PFHxS was significantly associated with higher levels of HDL-C [0.8 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.2)]. Inverse associations were observed between PFDA and TGs [-5.0 (95% CI: -8.1, -1.9)] and between PFNA and TGs [-1.7 (95% CI: -3.5, -0.02)], whereas a positive association was observed between PFDA and HDL-C [1.4 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.7)]. Nonsignificant nonlinear dose-response relationships were identified for associations of PFOA and PFOS with certain blood lipids.DISCUSSION: PFOA and PFOS were significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels in adults. Whether these findings may translate into an ele-vated cardiovascular disease risk associated with PFAS exposure warrants further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11840",,,,,,"Liu, Binkai/0000-0002-5478-5208",,,,,,,,,,,,,0091-6765,1552-9924,,,,MAY,2023,131,5,,,,,,,56001,10.1289/EHP11840,http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/EHP11840,,,,,,,,37141244,,,,,WOS:001019596900016,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the impact of PFAS on cardiovascular diseases remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the impact of PFAS on the stroke risk. Content: Databases were searched for studies published up to November 1, 2022, which report the association between stroke and exposure to at least one of four main PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS], perfluorononanoic acid [PFNA], and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid [PFHxS]). Data extraction and quality assessment were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Summary and outlook: Four studies were included in this systematic review. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident stroke per 1-log unit increment in each serum PFAS were combined in the meta-analysis. The risk of development of stroke was not significantly associated with PFOA, PFOS, or PFNA exposure (PFOA: pooled odds ratio [OR]=1.001, 95 % confidence interval [CI]=0.975-1.028, p=0.752), whereas a moderately lower risk was associated with PFHxS exposure without statistical significance (pooled OR=0.953, 95 % CI=0.908-1.001, p=0.054). PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA exposure showed a neutral association, while PFHxS showed a possible inverse association with the risk of stroke. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution.

We investigated cross-sectional associations between PFAS and body mass index (BMI) in teenagers/adolescents across nine European countries within the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative. We used data from 1957 teenagers (12-18 yrs) that were part of the HBM4EU aligned studies, consisting of nine HBM studies (NEBII, Norway; Riksmaten Adolescents 2016-17, Sweden; PCB cohort (follow-up), Slovakia; SLO CRP, Slovenia; CROME, Greece; BEA, Spain; ESTEBAN, France; FLEHS IV, Belgium; GerES V-sub, Germany). Twelve PFAS were measured in blood, whilst weight and height were measured by field nurse/physician or self-reported in ques-tionnaires. We assessed associations between PFAS and age-and sex-adjusted BMI z-scores using linear and logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. Random-effects meta-analysis and mixed effects models were used to pool studies. We assessed mixture effects using molar sums of exposure biomarkers with toxicological/structural similarities and quantile g-computation. In all studies, the highest concentrations of PFAS were PFOS (medians ranging from 1.34 to 2.79 mu g/L). There was a tendency for negative associations with BMI z-scores for all PFAS (except for PFHxS and PFHpS), which was borderline significant for the molar sum of [PFOA and PFNA] and significant for single PFOA [beta-coefficient (95% CI) per interquartile range fold change =-0.06 (-0.17, 0.00) and-0.08 (-0.15,-0.01), respectively]. Mixture assessment indicated similar negative associations of the total mixture of [PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS] with BMI z-score, but not all compounds showed associations in the same direction: whilst [PFOA, PFNA and PFOS] were negatively associated, [PFHxS] associated positively with BMI z-score.

Epidemiological studies have found that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are associated with hypertension. However, the correlation between PFASs and hypertension has not been systematically reported. Based on evidence from population epidemiological surveys, we conducted a meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to assess the correlation between PFASs exposure and hypertension. In this study, three databases of PubMed, Web of science, Embase were searched and 13 literatures with 81,096 participants were included. Literature heterogeneity was evaluated by I2 statistic, and the random effect model (I2 > 50%) and fixed effect model (I2 < 50%) were used to combine the studies in meta-analysis.

Data source: We conducted online searches of PubMed and Web of Science through May 17, 2022 and identified 14 eligible reports published from 2012 to 2022. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: We included studies conducted in humans, including mother-child pairs, which examined serum PFAS concentration in relation to serum concentration of antibody to a specific antigen following a vaccine. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: We used the risk of bias assessment for non-randomized studies of exposure and certainty assessment method proposed by Morgan et al. (2019). Using a multilevel meta-regression model, we quantitatively synthesized the data. Results: The 14 reports represented 13 unique groups of subjects; the frequency of studies of a given antibody was Tetanus (n = 7); followed by Diphtheria (6); Measles (4); Rubella (3); Haemophilus influenzae type b and Influenza A H1N1 (2 each); and Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Influenza A H2N3, Influenza B, and Mumps (1 each). There were approximately 4,830 unique participants included in the analyses across the 14 reports. The models of coefficients between antibody concentration and the five principal PFAS showed homogeneity of associations across antibody types for each principal PFAS. In the models with all antibodies treated as one type, evidence of effect modification by life stage was present for PFOA and PFOS, and for consistency, all associations were evaluated for all ages and for children. The summary associations (coefficients for difference in log(e)[antibody concentration] per doubling of serum PFAS) with 95% confidence intervals that excluded zero (statistical support), and certainty of evidence ratings were as follows: for PFOA and all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.10, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.16, -0.03; moderate); for Diphtheria in children, -0.12 (-0.23, -0.00; high); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.17, -0.01; moderate), and for Tetanus in children, -0.12 (-0.24, -0.00; moderate). For PFOS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.11, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.18, -0.03; moderate); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.15, -0.03; high) and in children, -0.12 (-0.20, -0.04; high). For PFHxS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.03 (-0.06, -0.00; moderate) and in children, -0.05 (-0.09, -0.00; low); and for Rubella in children, -0.07 (-0.11, -0.02; high). Summary associations for PFNA and PFDA did not have statistical support, but all PFAS studied tended to have an inverse association with antibody concentrations. Limitations and conclusions: Epidemiologic data on immunosuppression and five principal PFAS suggest an association, with support across antibodies against multiple types of antigens. Data on Diphtheria, Rubella, and Tetanus were more supportive of an association than for other antibodies, and support was greater for associations with PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, than for PFNA or PFDA. The data on any specific antibody were scarce. Confounding factors that might account for the relation were not identified. Nearly all studies evaluated were judged to have a low or moderate risk of bias.",,,,,,"Crawford, Lori/0000-0003-0972-4104; Skidmore, Becky/0000-0001-8293-9238",,,,,,,,,,,,,0160-4120,1873-6750,,,,FEB,2023,172,,,,,,,,107734,10.1016/j.envint.2023.107734,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2023.107734,,FEB 2023,,,,,,36764183,,,,,WOS:000937315100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship between PFAS exposure and lipid profile levels based on population-based epidemiological studies.

An elevated danger of pregnancy complications perhaps connected with exposure to PFASs, but the potential effects remain elusive. The objective of this study is to investigate the possible association between PFASs exposure and pregnancy complications, drawing upon existing evidence. Methods: Electronic databases of PubMed, Qvid Medline, Embase, and Web of Science were searched thoroughly to identify eligible research published prior to November 28, 2023, examining the relationship between PFASs and pregnancy-related complications. To evaluate the quality of observational studies incorporated into the article, the Strengthening Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) tool was utilized. The main outcomes assessed in this study included gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), gestational hypertension (GH), and preeclampsia (PE). Results: Twenty-five relevant studies involving 30079 participants were finally selected from four databases. The combined estimates indicate that prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and perfluoroenanthic acid (PFHpA) is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (PFOA: OR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.07-1.94, P = 0.015; PFHxS: OR = 1.16, 95%CI: 1.00-1.36, P = 0.055; PFBS: OR = 1.44, 95%CI: 1.16-1.79, P = 0.001; PFHpA: OR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.10-1.82, P = 0.008). The exposure to PFBS is positively associated with HDP (OR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.14-1.41, P < 0.001), while both PFOA and PFHpA demonstrate statistically significant positive correlations with GH (PFOA: OR = 1.09, 95%CI: 1.00-1.19, P = 0.049; PFHpA: OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.15-1.78, P = 0.001). Negative correlations were observed for prenatal perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) exposure and GH (OR = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.57-0.87, P = 0.001). However, no compelling evidence was identified to link PFASs exposure with the risk of PE. Conclusion: According to the meta-analysis findings, exposure to PFASs may be linked to GDM, HDP, and GH, but it does not significantly raise the risk of PE alone. Further research with larger sample size is required to verify this potential association and explore the biological mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0147-6513,1090-2414,,,,MAR 1,2024,272,,,,,,,,116017,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116017,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2024.116017,,JAN 2024,,,,,,38290316,,,,,WOS:001176095200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Our researchers assess the quality of the included studies and their risk of bias using the recommended method and tool. This study uses meta-analyses of the random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that the risk of hyperuricemia was strongly associated with three perfluorinated compounds, PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS, with the OR(95%CI) of 1.26 (1.07-1.47), 1.44(1.15-1.79), and 1.23(1.01-1.50) respectively. We also found a weak as-sociation between two other perfluorinated compounds, PFDA and PFHxS. Other than that, the summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident hyperuricemia were 2.34 (1.79-3.08) for DDT, 3.25(2.40-4.39) for DDE, 2.57 (1.37-4.81) for PCBs and 3.05(2.22-4.19) in trans-nonanchlor. Therefore, DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, PCBs, and trans-nonanchlor have also been linked with an increased risk of hyperuricemia in humans.

However, the metabolic pathways linking PFAS exposure and human disease are unclear. OBJECTIVE: We examined associations of PFAS mixtures with alterations in metabolic pathways in independent cohorts of adolescents and young adults.METHODS: Three hundred twelve overweight/obese adolescents from the Study of Latino Adolescents at Risk (SOLAR) and 137 young adults from the Southern California Children's Health Study (CHS) were included in the analysis. Plasma PFAS and the metabolome were determined using liquid-chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. A metabolome-wide association study was performed on log-transformed metabolites using Bayesian regression with a g-prior specification and g-computation for modeling exposure mixtures to estimate the impact of exposure to a mix-ture of six ubiquitous PFAS (PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA). Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Mummichog and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Significance across cohorts was determined using weighted Z-tests.RESULTS: In the SOLAR and CHS cohorts, PFAS exposure was associated with alterations in tyrosine metabolism (meta-analysis p = 0.00002) and de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (p = 0.03), among others. For example, when increasing all PFAS in the mixture from low ( 30th percentile) to high ( 70th percentile), thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone related to tyrosine metabolism, increased by 0.72 standard deviations (SDs; equivalent to a standardized mean difference) in the SOLAR cohort (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 0.00, 1.20) and 1.60 SD in the CHS cohort (95% BCI: 0.39, 2.80). Similarly, when going from low to high PFAS exposure, arachidonic acid increased by 0.81 SD in the SOLAR cohort (95% BCI: 0.37, 1.30) and 0.67 SD in the CHS cohort (95% BCI: 0.00, 1.50). In general, no individual PFAS appeared to drive the observed associations. DISCUSSION: Exposure to PFAS is associated with alterations in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in adolescents and young adults. https:// doi.org/10.1289/EHP11372",,,,,"WANG, SHIHAO/KHC-8263-2024; Alderete, Tanya Lynn/H-3356-2019","Alderete, Tanya Lynn/0000-0002-7751-9543; Goodrich, Jesse/0000-0001-6615-0472",,,,,,,,,,,,,0091-6765,1552-9924,,,,FEB,2023,131,2,,,,,,,27005,10.1289/EHP11372,http://dx.doi.org/10.1289/EHP11372,,,,,,,,36821578,,,,,WOS:000995472900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objective To assess the relationship of suspect toxicants to maturation, specifically to age at menarche. Methods We conducted two systematic reviews of age at menarche and PFOA, PFOS, PCBs and DDE/DDT based on publications indexed by pubmed. Results 16 unique reports were identified. Most studies of PFOA and PFOS reported either no association or delays in the age at menarche; only one reported an earlier age. Studies of DDT and DDE were more mixed. Reports on PCBs varied by PCB congener group with an equal number of them reporting delays and no association but one an acceleration. Sources of variation in results include the timing of exposure assessment (prenatal vs. postnatal), level of the toxicant, and sample size. No obvious pattern to the variation in results could be tied to those sources of variation. Conclusion The absence of consistent evidence from multiple reports of earlier age at menarche suggests that these toxicants may not be responsible for accelerated sexual maturation in girls. However, human populations naturally vary in the variety and levels of exposure, making the comparison of studies difficult.

Although high PFAS levels have been associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile, the distribution of levels and relations with cardio-metabolic risk markers in the general population have not been fully characterized. We assessed the association between blood levels of perfluorooctaneic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and a range of lipoproteins and metabolites as well as clinical lipid measurements. We used data from participants of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study (NEO) (n = 584) and the Rhineland Study (n = 1962), jointly spanning an age range of 30 to 89 years. PFAS were measured with the Metabolon HD4 platform, and lipoprotein and metabolite profiles were measured using Nightingale's nuclear magnetic resonance-spectroscopy platform, and mainly comprised lipoprotein markers. Using linear regression analyses, we quantified age-, sex-, and education-adjusted associations of PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS with clinical lipid measurements and 224 lipoproteins and metabolites. Higher levels of PFAS, particularly PFOS and PFHxS, were associated with higher concentrations of total lipid, cholesterol and phospholipid content in most HDL, IDL, LDL, and VLDL subclasses. The effect sizes were age-dependent for the majority of the associations, with the deleterious effects of PFAS being generally stronger in people below compared to those above median age.

This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations.Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for rele-vant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (>= 18 years old) and children. Primary find-ings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between con-centrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were per-formed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool.Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associa-tions between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations.Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human popula-tions.

Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of PFAS on female fertility based on population evidence.Methods: Electronic searches of the Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were conducted (from inception to March 2022) to collect observational studies related to PFAS and female fertility. Two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted information and evaluated the risk of bias for the included studies, meta-analysis was performed using R software.Results: A total of 5468 records were searched and 13 articles fully met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was negatively associated with the female fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (Cl) [0.78; 0.98]) and positively associated with the odds ratio for infertility (OR = 1.33, 95%Cl [1.03; 1.73]). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure was negatively associated with the fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.94, 95% CI [0.90; 0.98]). Pooled effect values for per-fluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) exposure did not find sufficient evidence for an association with female fertility.Conclusion: Based on the evidence provided by the current study, increased levels of PFAS exposure are asso-ciated with reduced fertility in women, this was characterized by a reduction in fecundability odds ratio and an increase in odds ratio for infertility. This finding could partially explain the decline in female fertility and provide insight into risk assessment when manufacturing products containing PFAS.",,,,,"liu, jiajia/ISS-0316-2023; zhang, yue/JAC-3705-2023; Wang, lili/IXD-9828-2023; lu, qian/IUN-7445-2023; Liu, Shao/JFK-0166-2023; zhang, wb/JGM-5316-2023; liu, bing/JJD-5566-2023; wang, jing/GRS-7509-2022; LIU, HAO/JBI-9623-2023; LI, XIAO/JCE-6169-2023; .., What/IXW-6776-2023; JIN, LIYING/JFB-1980-2023; Wu, Wenli/IYJ-1598-2023; LI, QI/IUM-8577-2023; Wang, Siyi/JNT-2690-2023; Cheng, Yuan/JKJ-0794-2023; Zhang, Zhentao/JQV-7389-2023; li, jincheng/GQP-6856-2022; wang, wei/JBS-7400-2023; yan, xiao/JVP-0766-2024; Lu, Xiaomei/IUQ-2139-2023; Ma, Xiaodong/JAN-7473-2023; li, bo/JJC-2664-2023; Wang, Xinhua/ISR-8520-2023; LI, Xiang/JBJ-8387-2023; Yan, Jing/JFA-6705-2023; Zhang, Jinfan/JPK-7588-2023; Zhou, heng/JCN-6493-2023; Hong, Xiang/AAH-6374-2019; liu, jianyang/JXL-6273-2024; Liu, Ying/ISU-1216-2023; lu, yang/IWE-3635-2023; Liu, DY/JPL-4171-2023; qi, li/JFE-7167-2023; Wang, He/JCO-3900-2023","Hong, Xiang/0000-0003-3407-0026; Wang, Bei/0000-0002-5232-0933",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-9351,1096-0953,,,,JAN 1,2023,216,,3,,,,,,114718,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114718,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114718,,NOV 2022,,,,,,36334833,,,,,WOS:000883761200006,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, it is unclear whether the toxicity of these alternatives is lower than that of PFOS. Therefore, this study investigated the toxicity and differences in PFBS, PFHxS, 6:2FTSA, and PFOS (0.2 mg/kg) after 56 d of exposure using the common invertebrate Eisenia fetida in soil as the test organism. The results showed that although PFOS, PFBS, PFHxS, and 6:2FTSA induced oxidative stress and apoptosis in earthworms and led to developmental and reproductive toxicity in terms of comprehensive toxicity, PFHxS > PFOS > PFBS >6:2FTSA.

Comparison analyses found that PFOA, HFPO-TA, and HFPO-DA exposures induced different effects on the embryonic development of zebrafish, which indicates the different modes of action. The HFPO-DA exposure induced specific effects on the disorder of lipid metabolism, HPT axis, and neurodevelopment. The HFPO-TA exposure also induced different effects from the PFOA exposure, which focused on lipid metabolism.

Intoxication caused by organochlorines can cause serious health compromises that can lead to death. However, the organochlorines molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, researching about this topic is necessary to propose new therapeutic strategies. This study presents a bioinformatics approach to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved in organochlorines exposure using strategies based in support vector machines with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) followed by an enrichment pathway analysis with null-diffusion. Methods: five groups of HepG2 cells were exposed to aldrin, DDT, endosulfan, lindane, and a mixture of them. A control group with dimethyl sulfoxide was included. A metabolomic analysis was done using GC/MS-TOF, followed by SVM-RFE and a pathway analysis using FELLA in order to identify relevant metabolites and metabolic pathways affected. Genes reported by FELLA were introduced in gene ontology platform (GO) to estimate cellular components where reactions associated to organochlorines occur. Results: 153 metabolites were identified in metabolomic analysis. SVM-RFE was trained with the datasets and the top ten metabolites for each organochlorine were determined. Pentose phosphate and the central carbon metabolism in cancer were identified by FELLA as common pathways for all organochlorines. Alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathways were suggested for aldrin, DDT, and endosulfan. Taurine and hypotaurine metabolism for lindane, and citrate cycle for the organochlorine's mixture.

Following regulatory bans on the production and emission of PFOA, concerns have been raised about the potential health risks and the safety of novel perfluoroalkyl analogues. HFPO-DA (trade name Gen-X) and HFPO-TA are two perfluoroalkyl analogues known to be bioaccumulative, whose level of toxicity and whether they are safe alternatives to PFOA remain unclear. In the following study, the physiological and metabolic effects of exposure to PFOA and its novel analogues were explored in zebrafish using 1/3 LC50 (PFOA 100 mu M, Gen-X 200 mu M, HFPO-TA 30 mu M). At the same LC50 toxicological effect, exposure to PFOA and HFPO-TA resulted in abnormal phenotypes such as spinal curvature, pericardial edema and aberrant body length, while Gen-X was little changed. Metabolically, PFOA, HFPO-TA and Gen-X all significantly increased total cholesterol in exposed zebrafish with PFOA and HFPO-TA also increasing total triglyceride levels. Transcriptome analysis showed that the number of differentially expressed genes in PFOA, Gen-X, and HFPO-TA treated conditions compared to control groups were 527, 572, and 3, 933, respectively. KEGG and GO analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed pathways and functions related to lipid metabolism as well as significant activation of the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPARs) pathway. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis identified significant dysregulation in the downstream target genes of PPAR alpha, which is responsible for lipid oxidative catabolism, and the SREBP pathway, which is responsible for lipid synthesis.

Several environmental toxins, particularly those that affect the normal function of the placenta and the endothelium, are emerging as potential risk factors for HDP. Among them, per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), widely used in a variety of commercial products, have been related to a variety of adverse health effects including HDP. This study was conducted by searching three databases for observational studies reporting associations between PFAS and HDP, all of which were published before December 2022. We used random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled risk estimates, and assessing each combination of exposure and outcome for quality and level of evidence. In total, 15 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The results from meta-analyses showed that risk of PE was increased with exposure to PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.85; N = 6 studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty), PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) (RR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.23, 1.86; N = 6 studies; exposure =1 ln-unit increment; moderate certainty), and PFHxS (perfluorohexane sulfonate) (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.76; N = 6 studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty).

Exposure to legacy PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS) is associated with an increased risk of PE, and PFOS is further associated with HDP.

To provide a comprehensive synopsis and show the gaps and gluts of existing research on PFAS exposure in wildlife, we created a systematic map and bibliographic analysis of the literature. We followed our protocol to conduct a systematic literature search on Scopus, Web of Science and five other databases. In two steps (title/abstract/keywords and full-text), we screened peer-reviewed empirical articles, preprints and theses in English that studied the concentration of at least one of 34 PFAS compounds in free-ranging wildlife or their parts/products. Following the protocol, we extracted data and performed a critical appraisal. We included 581 publications. From the first and only paper in 2001, there was a linear annual increase to 54 papers in 2021. While PFOS (97% of studies), PFOA (91%) and long-chain PFAS in general were the most measured, few studies investigated new-generation PFAS (e.g. GenX and ADONA). Across the studied 1042 species from 26 taxonomic classes, the most frequent were the common carp (Cyprinus carpio, 8%), polar bear (Ursus maritimus, 6%) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis, 5%). Most sampling took place in the United States (17%), Norway (13%), Canada (12%) and China (10%), which were also the main publishing countries. Polar regions attracted significant research interest from countries all around the globe. Aquatic habitats (marine: 31%, freshwater: 28%) of temperate zones were the most common locations for sample collection. We encourage researchers to work towards closing the following gaps: investigating new-generation PFAS, assessing PFAS in mid- and low-income countries and performing more long-term studies, especially on invertebrates. We note the recent rise in studies on the physiological consequences of PFAS exposure and encourage further work on this crucial topic. Furthermore, we recommend that the statement of potential and actual conflicts of interest, and the provision of raw data and analysis code should be made compulsory by all journals and routinely enforced.

The estimation of PFAS half-life (t1/2) is essential to quantify their persistence, their toxicity and mechanism of action in humans. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence on PFAS half-lives in humans from the available literature, and to investigate the limitations and uncertainties characterizing half-life estimation. Methods: The search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases up to July 03, 2023 and was aimed at identifying all papers that estimated PFAS half-life in human populations. We excluded studies on temporal trends or providing estimates of half-life based solely on renal clearance. As persistent and ongoing exposures can influence half-life estimation, we decided to include only studies that were conducted after the main source of exposure to PFAS had ceased. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on studies that reported perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) or perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) half-life estimation. Risk of bias was evaluated using the OHAT tool. Results: A total of 13 articles were included in the review, with 5 studies conducted in exposed general populations and 8 studies conducted in exposed workers; the estimated mean half-life ranged from 1.48 to 5.1 years for PFOA, from 3.4 to 5.7 years for total PFOS, and from 2.84 to 8.5 years for PFHxS. High heterogeneity among studies was observed; potential reasons include the variability among the investigated populations, discrepancies in considering ongoing exposures, variability in PFAS isomeric compositions, accounting for background exposure, time since exposure stopped and methods used for half-life estimation.

Multiple PFAS are associated with adverse liver outcomes in adult humans and toxicological models, but effects on the developing liver are not fully described. Here we performed transcriptomic analyses in the mouse to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatic toxicity in the dam and its fetus after exposure to two different PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its replacement, hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA, known as GenX). Pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed via oral gavage from embryonic day (E) 1.5-17.5 to PFOA (0, 1, or 5 mg/kg-d) or GenX (0, 2, or 10 mg/kg-d). Maternal and fetal liver RNA was isolated (N = 5 per dose/group) and the transcriptome analyzed by Affymetrix Array. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and differentially enriched pathways (DEP) were obtained. DEG patterns were similar in maternal liver for 5 mg/kg PFOA, 2 mg/kg GenX, and 10 mg/kg GenX (R2: 0.46-0.66). DEG patterns were similar across all 4 dose groups in fetal liver (R2: 0.59-0.81). There were more DEGs in fetal liver compared to maternal liver at the low doses for both PFOA (fetal = 69, maternal = 8) and GenX (fetal = 154, maternal = 93). Upregulated DEPs identified across all groups included Fatty Acid Metabolism, Peroxisome, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Adipogenesis, and Bile Acid Metabolism. Transcriptome-phenotype correlation analyses demonstrated > 1000 maternal liver DEGs were significantly correlated with maternal relative liver weight (R2 >0.92). These findings show shared biological pathways of liver toxicity for PFOA and GenX in maternal and fetal livers in CD-1 mice. The limited overlap in specific DEGs between the dam and fetus suggests the developing liver responds differently than the adult liver to these chemical stressors. This work helps define mechanisms of hepatic toxicity of two structurally unique PFAS and may help predict latent consequences of developmental exposure.",,,,,"Nguyen, Helen/KEJ-0775-2024","Nguyen, Helen/0000-0003-4032-9663",,,,,,,,,,,,,0147-6513,1090-2414,,,,DEC 15,2022,248,,,,,,,,114314,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114314,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2022.114314,,NOV 2022,,,,,,36436258,,,,,WOS:000916938800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Environmental chemicals are one of the drivers of such disturbances. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-specifically, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy) propanoic acid (GenX)-on the microbiome of the small intestine and colon, as well as on liver metabolism. Male CD-1 mice were exposed to PFOS and GenX in different concentrations and compared to controls. GenX and PFOS were found to have different effects on the bacterial community in both the small intestine and colon based on 16S rRNA profiles. High GenX doses predominantly led to increases in the abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto, Alistipes, and Ruminococcus, while PFOS generally altered Lactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Staphylococcus, and Ligilactobacillus. These treatments were associated with alterations in several important microbial metabolic pathways in both the small intestine and colon. Untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis of the liver, small intestine, and colon yielded a set of compounds significantly altered by PFOS and GenX. In the liver, these metabolites were associated with the important host metabolic pathways implicated in the synthesis of lipids, steroidogenesis, and in the metabolism of amino acids, nitrogen, and bile acids.

However, four additional Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers were produced during its manufacture, resulting in persistence in the environment due to their dissolvability and noxiousness. This study examines the sequential anaerobic-aerobic degradation of synthetically prepared solution of technical HCH (tHCH) utilizing a hybrid reactor system with a UASB reactor coupled to the aerobic system. The ideal conditions for t-HCH degradation were initial substrate concentration (100 mg L- 1), glucose as suitable electron donor, active biomass (12 g L-1), pH (neutral range), HRT (48 h) and organic loading rate (4.28 mg/g/day). Individual reactor findings demonstrated that the UASB reactor performed efficiently with these parameters, showing 90.03% degradation of 100 mg L-1 t-HCH in two days after a month of operation. In aerobic degradation, the selected isolate can break down 87% of 100 mg L-1 of t-HCH in eight days. Subsequent to individual reactor operations, the reactors were synchronized in the hybrid reactor and after 60 days of continuous operation, tHCH was dechlorinated completely in the presence of glucose as a co-substrate. Therefore, compared to individual anaerobic and aerobic treatments, this sequential degradation showed an improvement in HCH removal efficiency of > 99%.

Objectives: To investigate associations between PFAS exposure and incident CVD (a combined CVD end-point consisting of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or heart failure) in two independent population-based cohorts in Sweden. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis also including results from previous studies. Methods: In 2,278 subjects aged 45-75 years from the EpiHealth study, the risk of incident CVD in relation to relative plasma levels of perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was investigated.

Here, we leveraged high-resolution metabolomics to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways perturbed by exposure to a PFAS mixture during pregnancy. Targeted assessment of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), along with untargeted metabolomics profiling, were conducted on nonfasting serum samples collected from pregnant African Americans at 6-17 weeks gestation. We estimated the overall mixture effect and partial effects using quantile g-computation and single-chemical effects using linear regression. All models were adjusted for maternal age, education, parity, early pregnancy body mass index, substance use, and gestational weeks at sample collection. Our analytic sample included 268 participants and was socioeconomically diverse, with the majority receiving public health insurance (78%). We observed 13.3% of the detected metabolic features were associated with the PFAS mixture (n = 1705, p < 0.05), which was more than any of the single PFAS chemicals.

Twenty-six metabolites were validated against authenticated compounds and associated with the PFAS mixture (p < 0.05). Based on quantile g-computation weights, PFNA contributed the most to the overall mixture effect for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), tyrosine, and uracil. In one of the first studies of its kind, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of using methods designed for exposure mixtures in conjunction with metabolomics to assess the potential joint effects of multiple PFAS chemicals on the human metabolome. We identified more pronounced metabolic perturbations associated with the PFAS mixture than for single PFAS chemicals. Taken together, our findings illustrate the potential for integrating environmental mixture analyses and high-throughput metabolomics to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying human health.",,,,,"Liang, Donghai/U-6657-2019; Barr, Dana B/E-6369-2011","Liang, Donghai/0000-0001-7311-2298;",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,OCT 19,2023,57,43,,,,,16206,16218,,10.1021/acs.est.3c04561,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c04561,,OCT 2023,,,,,,37857362,,,,,WOS:001092795700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The substances have been associated with adverse health outcomes in both pregnant mothers and infants, including pre-eclampsia and low birthweight. A growing body of research suggests that PFAS are transferred from mother to fetus through the placenta, leading to in utero exposure. A systematic review was performed using the PubMed database to search for studies evaluating determinants of PFAS concentrations in blood matrices of pregnant mothers and neonates shortly after birth. Studies were included in this review if an observational study design was utilized, exposure to at least one PFAS analyte was measured, PFAS were measured in maternal or neonatal matrices, at least one determinant of PFAS concentrations was assessed, and results such as beta estimates were provided. We identified 35 studies for inclusion in the review and evaluated the PFAS and determinant relationships among the factors collected in these studies. Parity, breastfeeding history, maternal race and country of origin, and household income had the strongest and most consistent evidence to support their roles as determinants of certain PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers. Reported study findings on smoking status, alcohol consumption, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) suggest that these factors are not important determinants of PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers or neonates. Further study into informative factors such as consumer product use, detailed dietary information, and consumed water sources as potential determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is needed. Research on determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is critical to estimate past PFAS exposure, build improved exposure models, and further our understanding on dose-response relationships, which can influence epidemiological studies and risk assessment evaluations. Given the potential for adverse outcomes in pregnant mothers and neonates exposed to PFAS, it is important to identify and understand determinants of maternal and neonatal PFAS concentrations to better implement public health interventions in these populations.",,,,,,"McAdam, Jordan/0000-0001-9905-6001",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-069X,,,,MAY 10,2023,22,1,,,,,,,41,10.1186/s12940-023-00992-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12940-023-00992-x,,,,,,,,37161484,,,,,WOS:000983688500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Cohen",,,Systematic Evidence Mapping of Potential Exposure Pathways for Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances Based on Measured Occurrence in Multiple Media,ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Given that human biomonitoring surveys show per and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to be ubiquitous, humans can be exposed to PFAS through various sources, including drinking water, food, and indoor environmental media. Data on the nature and level of PFAS in residential environments are required to identify important pathways for human exposure. This work investigated important pathways of exposure to PFAS by reviewing, curating, and mapping evidence for the measured occurrence of PFAS in exposure media. Real-world occurrence for 20 PFAS was targeted primarily in media commonly related to human exposure (outdoor and indoor air, indoor dust, drinking water, food, food packaging, articles, and products, and soil). A systematic-mapping process was implemented to conduct title abstract and full-text screening and to extract PECO-relevant primary data into comprehensive evidence databases. Parameters of interest included the following: sampling dates and locations, numbers of collection sites and participants, detection frequencies, and occurrence statistics. Detailed data were extracted on PFAS occurrence in indoor and environmental media from 229 references and on PFAS occurrence in human matrices where available from those references. Studies of PFAS occurrence became numerous after 2005. Studies were most abundant for PFOA (80% of the references) and PFOS (77%). Many studies analyzed additional PFAS, particularly, PFNA and PFHxS (60% of references each). Food (38%) and drinking water (23%) were the commonly studied media. Most studies found detectable levels of PFAS, and detectable levels were reported in a majority of states in the United States. Half or more of the limited studies for indoor air and products detected PFAS in 50% or more of the collected samples. The resulting databases can inform problem formulation for systematic reviews to address specific PFAS exposure queries and questions, support prioritization of PFAS sampling, and inform PFAS exposure measurement studies.

Because of their high detection frequency, persistence, and potential toxicity, interest in both PFOA and PFOS has increased in recent years. However, a substantial number of PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests only report nominal, or unmeasured, treatment concentrations, which may complicate the determination of protective values. In addition, previous literature has indicated that differences between nominal and measured concentrations of both PFOA and PFOS could be linked to experimental conditions (e.g., feeding regimes for test organisms, test vessel material [glass or plastic], use of solvent, and the presence of substrate). Therefore, this critical review examined whether nominal and measured concentrations were in close agreement with each other among the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature and if experimental conditions were associated with any observed differences. Nominal and measured concentrations in the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature generally displayed a high degree of linear correlation and relatively low median percent differences. Correlations between measured and nominal concentrations were >0.98 for PFOA and >0.95 for PFOS in freshwater tests across experimental conditions. For saltwater tests, correlations of >0.84 were observed for PFOA and PFOS (separate and combined) across experimental conditions. While measured PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests are generally preferred, the present meta-analysis demonstrated that experimental conditions had little influence on observed discrepancies between nominal and measured concentrations, with the exception of PFOS saltwater tests and PFOA and PFOS freshwater studies that contained substrate. Unmeasured tests with these conditions should be considered carefully based on project needs, with the caveat that the data sets for these two experimental conditions were limited.

We examined the associations between maternal PFAS exposure and maternal glucose metabolisms and GDM risk among 1601 mothers who joined the Hyperglycaemia-and-Adverse-Pregnancy-Outcome (HAPO) Study in Hong Kong in 2001-2006. All mothers underwent a 75 g-oral-glucose-tolerance test at 24-32 weeks of gestation. We measured serum concentrations of six PFAS biomarkers using high-performance liquid-chromatography-coupled-withtandem-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). We fitted conventional and advanced models (quantile-g-computation [qgcomp] and Bayesian-kernel machine regression [BKMR]) to assess the associations of individual and a mixture of PFAS with glycaemic traits. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the enrollment period by the severe - acute -respiratory -syndrome (SARS) epidemic periods in Hong Kong between March 2003 and May 2004. PFOS and PFOA were the main components of PFAS mixture among 1601 pregnant women in the Hong Kong HAPO study, with significantly higher median PFOS concentrations (19.09 ng/mL), compared to Chinese pregnant women (9.40 ng/mL) and US women (5.27 ng/mL). Maternal exposure to PFAS mixture was associated with higher HbA1c in the qgcomp (beta = 0.04, 95 % CI: 0.01-0.06) model. We did not observe significant associations of PFAS mixture with fasting plasma glucose (PG), 1-h and 2-h PG in either model, except for 2-h PG in the qgcmop model (beta = 0.074, 95 % CI: 0.01-0.15). PFOS was the primary contributor to the overall positive effects on HbA1c. Epidemic -specific analyses showed specific associations between PFAS exposure and the odds of GDM in the pre-SARS epidemic period. The median concentration of PFOS was highest during the peri-SARS epidemic (21.2 [14.5-43.6] ng/mL) compared with the pre-SARS (12.3 [9.2-19.9] ng/mL) and post-SARS (20.3 [14.2-46.3] ng/mL) epidemic periods. Potential interactions and exposure -response relationships between PFOA and PFNA with elevated HbA1c were observed in the peri-SARS period in BKMR model.

The objective of this study was to know the effects of PFASs on microbial communities and their functional genes from source water to tap water. PFASs were detected by mass-labeled internal standards method, and the microbial communities and functional genes were analyzed by meta-genomics. Our results indicated that the concentration of total PFASs in the water ranged from 47.7 to 171.4 ng/ L, with perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) being the dominant types. The PFASs concentration decreased slowly from source to tap water in some months. PFBA, PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) influenced the functional genes related to two-component system, bacterial secretion system and flagellar assembly of Aquabacterium, Methylobacterium, and Curvibacter, which contributed significantly to macB and evgS. Therefore, the bacterial communities enhanced adaptation to fluctuating environments by upregulating some functional genes under the PFASs stress, with concomitant changes in the expression of ARGs. Moreover, PFASs also promoted the expression of functional genes associated with human diseases, such as shigellosis and tuberculosis, which increased the risk of human pathogenicity. The bench scale experiment results also suggested that PFOA and PFOS in drinking water can promote the ARGs proliferation and induce microbial risk.

A large number of studies using different approaches provide evidence regarding effects of environmental exposures, encompassed in the exposome, on children's health. We aimed to summarize the overall level of evidence (LoE) from all streams of evidence regarding exposome effects on child health. For 88 selected chemical and urban factors, we retrieved the conclusions of agency reports or literature reviews published between 2015 and 2021 regarding effects on child health, including cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodevelopmental, respiratory and other health outcomes. Adapted versions of PRISMA flowchart and AMSTAR-2 tool were used to select and assess the quality of the systematic reviews retrieved from PubMed and SCOPUS databases. For each factor-outcome pair, conclusions in three streams of evidence (epidemiological, toxicological and mechanistic, the latter corresponding to in vitro and in silico approaches) were translated into stream-specific LoEs and then combined into an overall LoE ranging from very unlikely to very likely. The 88 environmental factors were implied in 611 factor-outcome pairs. Forty-four pairs (7%), corresponding to 16 factors, had a very likely overall LoE (>= 80%); 127 pairs (21%), corresponding to 49 factors, had a likely or more overall LoE (>= 60%). For 81 pairs (13%), no evidence was available in agency reports or published reviews, while for 275 pairs (45%), corresponding to 68 factors, the overall LoE was very unlikely (<20%). Exposure factors with the greatest number of associated health outcomes with a high overall LoE were HCB, PCBs, temperature (8 outcomes), PFOA (7 outcomes), PFOS, cotinine (6 outcomes), arsenic, lead (5 outcomes), bisphenols A and S, PFNA and PM2.5 (4 outcomes), DDT, DDE and DDD, PFHxA, PFDA, green space, UV radiation (3 outcomes).

In vivo or in vitro experiments with human and animal models are the main means to determine the transdermal characteristics of emerging pollutants. However, these methods have many disadvantages such as high cost, time-consuming, large differences, and ethics. It is difficult to accurately estimate the skin exposure risk of emerging pollutants. Therefore, it is necessary to build up a skin permeability prediction mathematical model to assess the exposure and health risks of emerging pollutants. This article systematically reviews the research progress on the application of the skin permeability prediction model in the health risk assessment of emerging pollutants. At first, the basic structure of the skin and the main transdermal absorption pathways of emerging pollutants are introduced. Secondly, the basic principles and applications of existing skin permeability prediction models are summarized. The QSAR model and PBTK model were described according to the ratio of penetration to exposure dose. The QSAR model is described in detail to establish a regular model to predict the permeability of chemical pollutants in the skin by linking the structure and physicochemical characteristics of chemical substances with skin permeability. The accuracy of the results depends on the reliability of the modeling data. The PBTK model can be divided into the single-compartment model and the two-compartment model according to the characteristics of skin structure. And we summarized the application of the PBTK model on exposure risk assessment for industry workers or consumers. Moreover, we clarified the application of permeability prediction models in exposure risk and human health risk assessment and prospected the future research direction on dermal exposure risk assessment of emerging pollutants. The skin permeability prediction model optimizes the exposure parameters of daily skin exposure in risk assessment by predicting the skin permeability coefficient or permeability of emerging pollutants, to accurately assess the human exposure and health risk of emerging pollutants. At the end of this research progress, the future research objectives of skin permeability prediction models are pointed out: Improving the accuracy of data and considering the effect of skin esterase on skin permeability in prediction models.",,,,,"Zhang, Hui/HHN-8494-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0023-074X,2095-9419,,,,,2023,68,18,,,,,2354,2365,,10.1360/TB-2022-1115,http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2022-1115,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001025691400007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Gomti river, a groundwater-fed tributary of the Holy Ganges, is the lifeline of the middle Indo-Gangetic Plains. Screening of river pollutants for river cleanup is a challenging task. To this end, 20 km Lucknow stretch of Gomti was sampled at 5 locations for physicochemical-bacteriological analysis. Collected samples were analyzed for pH, TA, turbidity, DO, BOD, TH, COD, TDS, fecal coliform, and E. coli. Analytical instruments AAS and GC-ECD were used for heavy metal and organochlorine pesticide analysis. DO was 3.2 +/- 0.3 to 7.4 +/- 0.4 (avg 5 +/- 1.8) mg/l, BOD was 10.6 +/- 0.5 to 41 +/- 1.7 (avg 22.9 +/- 13.3) mg/l, while COD was 26.6 +/- 4.6 to 93.5 +/- 4.6 (avg 56 +/- 31.3) mg/l. WQI values gradually increased from S1 (56.7) to S5 (181.8) which denotes a significant deterioration of water quality downstream of the river.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of widely used industrial chemicals, are characterized by persistence, long-distance migration, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Some PFAS, particularly perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), have been banned, leaving only legacy exposure to the environment and human body, while a number of novel PFAS alternatives have emerged and raised concerns, such as polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic and carboxylic acid (PFESA and PFECA) and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS). Overall, this review systematically elucidated the adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of legacy and emerging PFAS, emphasized the dose/concentration-dependent, time-dependent, carbon chain length-dependent, sex-specific, and coexposure effects, and discussed the underlying mechanisms and possible prevention and treatment. Extensive epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggests that accumulated serum levels of legacy PFAS possibly contribute to an increased risk of CVD and its subclinical course, such as cardiac toxicity, vascular disorder, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The underlying biological mechanisms may include oxidative stress, signaling pathway disturbance, lipid metabolism disturbance, and so on. Various emerging alternatives to PFAS also play increasingly prominent toxic roles in CV outcomes that are milder, similar to, or more severe than legacy PFAS. Future research is recommended to conduct more in-depth CV toxicity assessments of legacy and emerging PFAS and explore more effective surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies, accordingly.",,,,,"zhang, yinfeng/AAX-4863-2021; zhang, yue/JAC-3705-2023; Wang, Jiachen/KFT-0161-2024","Zhang, Yin-Feng/0000-0003-2457-7712",,,,,,,,,,,,,0340-5761,1432-0738,,,,MAY,2023,97,5,,,,,1195,1245,,10.1007/s00204-023-03477-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00204-023-03477-5,,MAR 2023,,,,,,36947184,,,,,WOS:000957430200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 13 eligible studies searched from Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science by July 10, 2022, to explore the relationship between maternal exposure to PFAS and thyroid health effects, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (TT3), thyroxin (TT4), free T3 (FT3), and free T4 (FT4). The estimated values (beta) and the corresponding confidence intervals (95%CI) were extracted for analysis. The tests for heterogeneity, sensitivity and publication bias between studies were performed using Stata 15.0. The combined results showed a positive association between changes in TSH and exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), with no significant correlation observed between changes in other thyroid hormones and exposure to PFAS. This difference was attributed to sample size, region, sample type, body mass index (BMI), and gestational week.

We conducted a meta-regression to further examine the impact of gestational age at biomarker sample timing. We detected a-32.9 g (95%CI:-47.0,-18.7) mean BWT deficit per each ln PFNA increase from 27 included studies.

Using estimates of the specific gestational week of sampling, the meta-regression showed results consistent with the categorical sample analysis, in that as gesta-tional age at sampling time increases across these studies, the summary effect estimate of a mean BWT deficit got larger. Overall, we detected mean BWT deficits for PFNA that were larger and more consistent across studies than previous PFAS meta-analyses. Compared to studies with later sampling, BWT deficits were smaller but remained sizeable for even the earliest sampling periods.

It has currently been identified in the environment and human bodies; nonetheless, the possible toxicities are not well-known. Zebrafish have been used as a toxicant screening model due to their fast and transparent developmental pro-cesses. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PFHxS for five days, and various experiments were performed to monitor the developmental and cellular processes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/ MS) analysis confirmed that PFHxS was absorbed and accumulated in the zebrafish embryos. We reported that 2.5 mu M or higher PFHxS exposure induced phenotypic abnormalities, marked by developmental delay in the mid -hind brain boundary and yolk sac edema. Additionally, larvae exposed to PFHxS displayed facial malformation due to the reduction of neural crest cell expression. RNA sequencing analysis further identified 4643 differen-tiated expressed transcripts in 5 mu M PFHxS-exposed 5-days post fertilization (5-dpf) larvae. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, as well as oxidative stress were enriched in the PFHxS-exposed larvae. To validate these findings, a series of biological experiments were conducted. PFHxS exposure led to a nearly 4-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, possibly due to hyperglycemia and impaired glutathione balance. The Oil Red O' staining and qPCR analysis strengthens the notions that lipid metabolism was disrupted, leading to lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and malondialdehyde formation.

However, PFBS toxicity in the mammalian gut remains unclear. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 10 mu g/L and 500 mu g/L PFBS or 500 mu g/L PFOS in their water supply for 28 days. PFBS toxicity in the ileum and colon was explored and com-pared to that of PFOS. Biochemical analysis showed that tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-1f3 (IL-1f3) levels increased in the ileum exposed to 10 mu g/L PFBS, whereas no significant changes were observed in those levels in the colon. Catalase (CAT) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), TNF-a, and IL-1f3 levels increased and glutathione (GSH) levels decreased in the ileum of the 500 mu g/L-PFBS group, whereas only MDA levels increased in the colon of the 500 mu g/L-PFBS group. The results showed that more severe damage occurred in the ileum than in the colon after PFBS exposure, and these align with the 500 mu g/L-PFOS group exposure as well. Furthermore, metabolomic anal-ysis revealed glutathione metabolism as a vital factor in inducing PFBS and PFOS toxicities in the ileum. Steroid hor-mone and amino acid metabolisms were other important factors involved in PFBS and PFOS toxicities, respectively. In the colon, GSH, pyrimidine, and glucose (especially galactose) metabolism was the main contributor to PFBS toxicity, and sulfur amino acid metabolism was the main pathway for PFOS toxicity.

We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C-C and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts) affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate group). This study lays the groundwork for future research to analyze and elucidate the transformation products and pathways of PFAS in various treatment systems.",,,,,"Gar Alalm, Mohamed/P-5084-2018",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1385-8947,1873-3212,,,,DEC 15,2022,450,,4,,,,,,138352,10.1016/j.cej.2022.138352,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2022.138352,,AUG 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000888205800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Accumulated evidence implies that GenX exposure might exert adverse health effects, although the underlying mechanisms have not been fully revealed. In this study, pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to GenX (2 mg/kg/day), PFOA (1 mg/kg/day), or Milli-Q water by gavage from the first day of gestation (GD0) until GD21. Necropsy and tissue collection were conducted in pups at 4 weeks of age. PFOA and GenX induced similar histopathological changes in both the liver and the intestinal mucosa, accompanied by higher serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase. Moreover, the capacity of hepatic glycogen storage and intestinal mucus secretion were significantly decreased, suggesting dysfunction of liver metabolism and the intestinal mucosal barrier. A total of 637 and 352 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the liver tissues of GenX and PFOA group, respectively. Most of the enriched pathways from the DEGs by KEGG enrichment analysis were metabolism-associated. Moreover, overexpression of CYP4A14, Sult2a1, Cpt1b, Acaa1b, Igfbp1, Irs-2 and decreased expression of Gys2 wereobserved in livers of GenX exposed pups, supporting the hypothesis that there was metabolic disruption. Furthermore, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest proteins (Gadd45 beta, p21, Ppard) were significantly increased, while cell proliferation-related proteins (Cyclin E, Myc, EGFR) were decreased by gestational GenX exposure in the pups' liver. In addition, imbalance of gut microbiota and dysfunction of the intestinal mucosa barrier might contribute to hepatotoxicity at least in part. Taken together, our results suggested that gestational GenX exposure triggered metabolic disorder, which might be responsible for the hepatotoxicity in the pups in addition to dysfunction of the intestinal mucosa barrier. This study enriches the mechanisms of GenX-induced developmental hepatotoxicity by associating metabolic disorder with intestinal homeostasis.",,,,,"WANG, YANAN/KCL-4840-2024; xie, jing/KDO-9486-2024; zhang, can/KHC-5357-2024; Xu, Lingling/G-8708-2016; Liu, yuqing/KEI-3260-2024; Huang, Yong/KFA-1191-2024; Liu, Donghua/KEJ-1974-2024; yang, le/KFB-5420-2024; Zhou, Xinyi/KGM-6689-2024; wang, rong/KFQ-7187-2024","Liu, Donghua/0000-0002-5830-9540;",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,JAN 10,2024,907,,,,,,,,168059,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168059,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.168059,,OCT 2023,,,,,,37884144,,,,,WOS:001102890700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide important conduits between waste sources and the environment. We present a meta-analysis of results reported in 44 peer-reviewed publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples, collected from 21 countries, for which some or all of five per-fluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were measured. Our meta analysis revealed global patterns and trends that, to our knowledge, have not been reported elsewhere. Regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the PFAS and the corresponding mean concentration for each country. Although legacy compounds, perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have been reported with the highest measured concentrations, their global temporal trends are lowest of all PFAS considered. Concentrations of most PFAS analyzed in wastewater in the United States have not changed significantly with time, whereas reported PFAS concentrations in wastewater effluent from China have increased from 11% to 37% per year. In addition, our results show significant positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent concentrations of individual PFAS and the gross domestic product per capita of each country. Our analysis of this global data set also confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets: (i) none of the PFAS studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes; (ii) effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher PFAS concentrations; and (iii) the few studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) indicate that PFAS adsorbed to SPM can contribute significantly to the total PFAS load.",,,,,"Detwiler, Russell L/C-3228-2008",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0043-1354,1879-2448,,,,AUG 1,2022,221,,,,,,,,118784,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118784,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2022.118784,,,,,,,,35949071,,,,,WOS:000856041300006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Animal studies suggest that PFAS may increase risk of fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via impacts on hepatic lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, but human data is lacking. We examined associations between PFAS exposure, altered metabolic pathways, and risk of non-viral HCC. Methods: In this nested case-control study, pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS and metabolomics were measured in 50 incident HCC cases and 50 individually matched controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. Cases/controls were matched by age, sex, race, and study area. PFAS exposure and risk of HCC were examined using conditional logistic regression. A metabolome-wide association study and pathway enrichment analysis was performed for PFAS exposure and HCC risk, and key metabolites/metabolic pathways were identified using a meet in the middle approach. Results: High perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels (90th percentile from NHANES; > 55 lg/L) were associated with 4.5 -fold increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-16.0). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PFOS exposure was associated with alterations in amino acid and glycan biosynthesis pathways, which were also associated with HCC risk. We identified 4 metabolites linking PFOS exposure with HCC, including glucose, butyric acid (a short-chain fatty acid), alpha-ketoisovaleric acid (a branched-chain a-keto acid), and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (a bile acid), each of which was positively associated with PFOS exposure and risk of HCC. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept analysis shows that exposure to high PFOS levels was associated with increased risk of non-viral HCC, likely via alterations in glucose, amino acid, and bile acid metabolism. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Lay summary: Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as forever chemicals  because they are difficult to break down and stay in the human body for years, are extremely common and can cause liver damage. In a first of its kind study, we found that exposure to high levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, one of the most common PFAS chemicals, was linked to increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. Hepatocellular carcinoma is difficult to treat and is one of the most common forms of liver cancer, and these findings may provide new avenues for helping to prevent this disease.(c) 2022 The Author(s).

Emerging evidence suggested that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have the potential to interfere with the function of normal hormones, may play a crucial role in this trend. However, the potential relationships were inconsistent in various studies. Objective and search methods: In our study, we sought to fully evaluate the currently available epidemiological evidence to ascertain whether certain EDC congeners and their metabolites are related to breast cancer risk. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in three electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Publications that covered xenobiotic EDC exposures and breast cancer-confirmed histological results or antecedent medical records or reporting to health registers were taken into consideration. Outcomes: The final result of the literature search was 6,498 references, out which we found 67 publications that matched the requirements for meta-analysis and eight publications for qualitative trend synthesis. In this meta-analysis, statistically significant associations revealed that (i) 1-chloro-4-[2,2,2-trichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene (p,p'-DDT) and its major metabolite 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were somewhat related to a greater risk of breast cancer. However, this relationship only existed in blood serum but not in adipose tissue. (ii) Breast cancer risk was increased by exposure to chlordane and hexachlorocyclohexane. (iii) Five polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 99, PCB 105, PCB 118, PCB 138, and PCB 183) can increase the risk of breast cancer. (iv) One phthalate congener (BBP) and one per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance congener (PFDoDA) were negatively associated with breast cancer risk.

To offer insight into their possible biologic effects, we evaluated the metabolomic correlates of circulating PFOS and PFOA among 3,647 participants in eight nested case-control serum metabolomic profiling studies from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial.Methods: Metabolomic profiling was conducted by Metabolon Inc., using ultra high-performance liquid chro-matography/tandem accurate mass spectrometry. We conducted study-specific multivariable linear regression analyses estimating the associations of metabolite levels with levels of PFOS or PFOA. For metabolites measured in at least 3 of 8 nested case-control studies, random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize study-specific results (1,038 metabolites in PFOS analyses and 1,100 in PFOA analyses). Results: The meta-analysis identified 51 and 38 metabolites associated with PFOS and PFOA, respectively, at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level (4.8x10-5 and 4.6x10-5, respectively). For both PFOS and PFOA, the most common types of associated metabolites were lipids (sphingolipids, fatty acid metabolites) and xenobiotics (xanthine metabolites, chemicals). Positive associations were commonly observed with lipid metabolites sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0) (P = 2.0x10-10 and 2.0x10-8, respectively), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpro-pionate (P = 2.7x10-15, 1.1x10-17), and lignoceroylcarnitine (C24) (P = 2.6x10-8, 6.2x10-6). The strongest pos-itive associations were observed for chemicals 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (P = 3.0x10-112 and 6.8x10-13, respectively) and 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (P = 1.6x10-14, 2.3x10-6). Other me-tabolites positively associated with PFOS included D-glucose (carbohydrate), carotene diol (vitamin A meta-bolism), and L-alpha-aminobutyric acid (glutathione metabolism), while uric acid (purine metabolite) was positively associated with PFOA. PFOS associations were consistent even after adjusting for PFOA as a covariate, while PFOA associations were greatly attenuated with PFOS adjustment.Conclusions: In this large metabolomic study, we observed robust positive associations with PFOS for several molecules.

PFAS substances that have longer carbon chains, such as PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), can potentially pose a significant public health risk due to their ability to bioaccumulate and persist for long periods of time in the body and the environment. The National Academies Report suggests there is some evidence of PFOS exposure and gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation contributing to ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis are precursors to colorectal cancer. However, evidence about the association between PFOS and colorectal cancer is limited and has shown contradictory findings. This review provides an overview of population and preclinical studies on PFOS exposure and GI inflammation, metabolism, immune responses, and carcinogenesis. It also highlights some mitigation approaches to reduce the harmful effects of PFOS on GI tract and discusses the dietary strategies, such as an increase in soluble fiber intake, to reduce PFOS-induced alterations in cellular lipid metabolism. More importantly, this review demonstrates the urgent need to better understand the relationship between PFOS and GI pathology and carcinogenesis, which will enable development of better approaches for interventions in populations exposed to high levels of PFAS, and in particular to PFOS.",,,,,,"Durham, Jerika/0000-0002-1313-0627",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2673-3080,,,,AUG 15,2023,5,,,,,,,,1244457,10.3389/ftox.2023.1244457,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/ftox.2023.1244457,,,,,,,,37662676,,,,,WOS:001057222700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination.

However, PFASs conversion or conjugation to other substances in rice grown on PFASs polluted soil has not been explored clearly. These unknown transformed or conjugated products of PFOA and PFOS could be harmful to human health. The restriction factor in evaluating the possible transformation of PFOA and PFOS is mainly attributed to the lack of an efficient method for screening PFOA and PFOS and their related metabolites. To circumvent this challenge, we established a nontargeted screening method by combining a fluoro-cotton fiber-based solid phase extraction (FC-SPE) and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to monitor the formation of possible organic fluorine compounds from rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown on PFASs. We synthesized fluoro-cotton fibers to serve as the FC-SPE packing material and characterized by field-emission scanning electron-microscope, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The optimal extraction conditions for the prepared FC-SPE were investigated. The performance of FC-SPE in LC-MS analysis was validated by linearity, precision, recovery, and matrix effect. Then the FC-SPE combined with LC-HRMS was used to specifically capture organic fluorine compounds from complex matrices via F-F interaction, including rice seedlings grown in PFOA and PFOS polluted soil and soil samples. By the established FC-SPE LC-HRMS method, in total 429 features were found as the possible organic fluorine compounds from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil among the 1781 features from the rice seedlings. Finally, we employed a13C metabolic tracing analysis of organic fluorine compounds in combination with the FC-SPE LC-HRMS method to further identify the features that detected from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil.

Evidence suggests that exposure to POPs, which is ubiquitous, is associated with microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. miRNA are key regulators in many physiological processes. It is thus of public health concern to understand the relationships between POPs and miRNA as related to health outcomes. Objectives: This systematic review evaluated the relationship between widely recognized, intentionally manufactured, POPs, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB]), with miRNA expression in both human and animal studies. Methods: We used PubMed and Embase to systematically search the literature up to September 29th, 2023. Search results for human and animal studies were included if they incorporated at least one POP of interest in relation to at least one miRNA. Data were synthesized to determine the direction and significance of associations between POPs and miRNA. We utilized ingenuity pathway analysis to review disease pathways for miRNA that were associated with POPs. Results: Our search identified 38 eligible studies: 9 in humans and 29 in model organisms. PFAS were associated with decreased expression of miR-19, miR-193b, and miR-92b, as well as increased expression of miR-128, miR199a-3p, and miR-26b across species. PCBs were associated with increased expression of miR-15a, miR-1537, miR-21, miR-22-3p, miR-223, miR-30b, and miR-34a, as well as decreased expression of miR-130a and let-7b in both humans and animals. Pathway analysis for POP-associated miRNA identified pathways related to carcinogenesis. Discussion: This is the first systematic review of the association of POPs with miRNA in humans and model organisms. Large-scale prospective human studies are warranted to examine the role of miRNA as mediators between POPs and health outcomes.",,,,,,"Costello, Elizabeth/0000-0002-5094-9017; Goodrich, Jesse/0000-0001-6615-0472; Li, Yijie/0000-0001-7551-117X; Chen, Jiawen/0000-0002-6022-9646; Eckel, Sandrah/0000-0001-6050-7880",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-9351,1096-0953,,,,MAR 1,2024,244,,,,,,,,117832,10.1016/j.envres.2023.117832,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2023.117832,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38056610,,,,,WOS:001165807400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Only a fraction of PFAS are currently monitored and regulated and the presence and effects on aquatic organisms of many PFAS are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the health effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS on aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The main result shows that PFAS in concentrations up to 13.5 mu g/L have adverse effects on body size variables for secondary consumers. However, no significant effects on liver or gonad somatic indices and neither on fecundity were found.

We examined associations between pregnancy and childhood PFOS and PFOA exposure and childhood infections, asthma, allergic sensitization, atopic dermatitis, and lung function measures, and studied potential mechanisms by integrating data on systemic low-grade inflammation (hs-CRP), functional immune responses, and epigenetics.Findings Higher maternal PFOS and PFOA exposure during pregnancy showed association with a non-atopic asthma phenotype by age 6, a protection against sensitization, and no association with atopic asthma or lung function, or atopic dermatitis. The effect was primarily driven by prenatal exposure. There was no association with infection proneness, low-grade inflammation, altered immune responses or epigenetic changes.Interpretations Prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA, but not childhood exposure, specifically increased the risk of low prevalent non-atopic asthma, whereas there was no effect on atopic asthma, lung function, or atopic dermatitis. 2023;94:",,,,,"Schoos, Ann-Marie/AAO-7677-2020; Rasmussen, Morten Arendt/S-8843-2017; Schullehner, Jorg/G-1166-2014","Schoos, Ann-Marie/0000-0002-5827-0885; Rasmussen, Morten Arendt/0000-0001-7431-5206; Lasky-Su, Jessica/0000-0001-6236-4705; Schullehner, Jorg/0000-0002-1153-6885",,,,,,,,,,,,,2352-3964,,,,,AUG,2023,94,,,,,,,,104699,10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104699,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ebiom.2023.104699,,JUL 2023,,,,,,37429082,,,,,WOS:001039402300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate current human epidemiological evidence on the relationship between PFAS exposure and glucolipid metabolism in childhood and adolescence. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases, and identified population-based epidemiological studies related to PFAS and glucolipid metabolism indexes that were published before 30 December 2022. The heterogeneity of the included literature was assessed using the I-square (I-2) test and statistics Q. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to combine the effect size. Subgroup analysis based on age and sex of the study participants was performed. A sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the robustness and reliability of the combined results. Egger's and Begg's tests were used to analyze publication bias. Results: A total of 12 studies were included in this analysis. There was a positive association between PFAS and TC (beta = 1.110, 95% CI: 0.601, 1.610) and LDL (beta = 1.900, 95% CI: 1.030, 2.770), and a negative association between PFAS and HOMA-IR in children and adolescents (beta = -0.130, 95% CI: -0. 200, -0.059). PFOS was significant positive associated with TC (beta = 8.22, 95% CI: 3.93, 12.51), LDL (beta = (12.04, 95% CI: 5.08, 18.99), and HOMA-IR (beta = -0.165, 95% CI: -0.292, -0.038). Subgroup analysis showed that exposure to PFAS in the adolescent group was positively associated with TC and LDL levels, and the relationship was stronger in females. Conclusion: PFAS exposure is associated with glucolipid metabolism in children and adolescents. Among them, PFOS may play an important role.

Objectives This study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS with mortality and morbidity of diabetes and to quantitatively evaluate the summary effect estimates of the existing literature. Methods We searched three electronic databases for epidemiological studies concerning PFAS and diabetes published before April 1, 2022. Summary odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), or beta and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were respectively calculated to evaluate the association between PFAS and diabetes using random-effects model by the exposure type, and dose-response meta-analyses were also performed when possible. We also assessed the risk of bias of the studies included and the confidence in the body of evidence. Results An initial literature search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 studies were eventually included. The meta-analyses indicated that the observed statistically significant PFAS-T2DM associations were consistent in cohort studies, while the associations were almost non-significant in case-control and cross-sectional studies. Dose-response meta-analysis showed a parabolic-shaped association between perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) exposure and T2DM risk. Available evidence was rated with low risk of bias, and the level of evidence for PFAS and incident T2DM was considered moderate. Conclusions Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure may increase the risk of incident T2DM, and that PFOA may exert non-monotonic dose-response effect on T2DM risk. Considering the widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects of PFAS, further cohort studies with improvements in expanding the sample size, adjusting the covariates, and considering different types of PFAS exposure at various doses, are needed to elucidate the putative causal associations and potential mode of action of different PFAS on diabetes. Impact Statement A growing body of evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the development of diabetes. However, epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS and diabetes is inconsistent. We performed this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to PFAS may increase diabetes risk among the general population. Reduced exposure to these forever and everywhere chemicals may be an important preventative approach to reducing the risk of diabetes across the population.",,,,,"Li, Jiawei/JOJ-9277-2023; chen, chen/JGD-3057-2023; lin, qing/JED-5250-2023; xu, ke/JSL-2305-2023; gui, siyu/HMO-5155-2023; Xi, Yang/KEH-5204-2024; Ding, Yang/JUV-4842-2023","Hu, Cheng-Yang/0000-0002-0052-9030",,,,,,,,,,,,,1559-0631,1559-064X,,,,JAN,2023,33,1,,,,,40,55,,10.1038/s41370-022-00464-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41370-022-00464-3,,AUG 2022,,,,,,35970987,,,,,WOS:000840586700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Most studies have evaluated breast cancer (BC) as a single entity without considering the different molecular expressions, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2, that could differ in their association with these contaminants. Hence, we assessed the association between biological concentration of OCP and BC, according to its molecular receptor expression, based on a systematic review and meta-analysis.Recent FindingsOf the 141 articles eligible for full-text review, nine met the inclusion criteria. The way in which molecular expression was reported was heterogeneous; therefore, the inclusion of studies in the meta-analysis was limited to eight articles.

No associations were observed for p,p '-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, cis-nonachlor, and dieldrin, and it was not possible to evaluate the associations between OCP with HER2 expression or triple-negative tumors due to lack of data.SummaryThe results suggest that some OCP might be associated with BC depending on the expression of ER.

Concentrations were measured in different exposure windows (periconception and prenatal), related to NTDs such as anencephaly and spina bifida. Different data collection techniques, types of biological samples, and exposure windows were used, which made comparison difficult. The main pesticides studied included DDT, DDE, HCH, and endosulfan. Maternal serum showed the highest concentrations of pesticides, but detection in placental tissue and umbilical cord confirms embryonic exposure.

In this systematic review, we aimed to identify consistent findings between PFAS and metabolomic signatures. We conducted a search matching specific keywords that was independently reviewed by two authors on two databases (EMBASE and PubMed) from their inception through July 19, 2022 following PRISMA guidelines.Recent FindingsWe identified a total of 28 eligible observational studies that evaluated the associations between 31 different PFAS exposures and metabolomics in humans. The most common exposure evaluated was legacy long-chain PFAS. Population sample sizes ranged from 40 to 1,105 participants at different stages across the lifespan. A total of 19 studies used a non-targeted metabolomics approach, 7 used targeted approaches, and 2 included both. The majority of studies were cross-sectional (n = 25), including four with prospective analyses of PFAS measured prior to metabolomics.Most frequently reported associations across studies were observed between PFAS and amino acids, fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, phosphosphingolipids, bile acids, ceramides, purines, and acylcarnitines. Corresponding metabolic pathways were also altered, including lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, nucleotide, energy metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins.

Hypercaloric, high-fat diet is considered to promote the accumulation of toxic lipophilic substances in tissues, whereas the loss of body fat through caloric restriction results in a recirculation of these substances. In rats, oral administration of DDE causes the onset of tissues damage; the concomitant intake of a high-fat diet ameliorates tissues status, probably because of the entrapment of the lipophilic substance in fat depots. Recent evidence demonstrates that DDE alters the expression of metallothioneins, proteins involved in cellular defense from oxidative stress, in a diet- and tissue-specific manner. This study is aimed to verify if 2 weeks of caloric restriction after the oral DDE treatment can modify metallothionein gene expression in tissues of high-fat fed rats. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrates that metallothionein gene expression after calorie restriction is tissue-specific and strongly influenced by both previous dietary conditions and DDE exposure. To avoid misleading conclusions on the interference of toxic xenobiotics on metallothionein gene expression is particularly important to consider the tissue, the cellular conditions, and the nutritional status of the animals, especially when the protein is used as an index of cells health.",,,,,"Scudiero, Rosaria/AAI-2119-2020","Scudiero, Rosaria/0000-0002-8186-9722; MIGLIACCIO, Vincenzo/0000-0002-8820-4694",,,,,,,,,,,,,0360-1234,1532-4109,,,,NOV 2,2022,57,11,,,,,859,864,,10.1080/03601234.2022.2127594,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03601234.2022.2127594,,SEP 2022,,,,,,36173099,,,,,WOS:000861984100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Adsorbents with large mesopores and high specific surface area adsorb PFAS faster, their adsorption capacities are higher, and the adsorption process are usually more effective under low pH conditions. PFAS adsorption mechanisms mainly include electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interaction, anion exchange, and ligand exchange. Various adsorbents show promising performances but challenges such as requirements of organic solvents in regeneration, low adsorption selectivity, and complicated adsorbent preparations should be addressed before large scale implementation. Moreover, the aid of decision-making tools including response surface methodology (RSM), techno-economic assessment (TEA), life cycle assessment (LCA), and multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) were discussed for engineering applications.

The liver acts as a key target organ for toxicity within the body and is vital for regulating metabolic processes, particularly lipid metabolism. However, there is currently a significant research gap regarding the influences of PFBS on hepatic lipid metabolism, especially in individuals with different dietary statuses. Here, the objective of this research was to examine the effects of PFBS on hepatic function under different dietary conditions. The results suggested that the levels of liver injury biomarkers were significantly upregulated, e.g., transaminase (GPT, GOT), while liver lipid levels were downregulated after exposure to PFBS at concentration of 50 mu g/L for 42 days. Moreover, restricted diet further intensified the adverse effects of PFBS on the liver. Metabolomics analysis identified significant alterations in lipid-related metabolites in PFBS-induced hepatotoxicity, PFBS exposure induced a decrease in lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcho-line. PFBS exposure caused an increase in aldosterone and prostaglandin f2alpha under restricted diet.

We undertook a systematic review to synthesize this literature and explore sources of heterogeneity in previously published epidemiological studies.MethodsStudies that collected individual-level PFAS and anthropometric data from children up to 12 years of age were identified by searching six databases. We excluded studies that only evaluated obesity measures at the time of birth. A full-text review and quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) criteria. Forest plots were created to summarize measures of association and assess heterogeneity across studies by chemical type and exposure timing. Funnel plots were used to assess small-study effects.ResultsWe identified 24 studies, of which 19 used a cohort design. There were 13 studies included in the meta-analysis examining various chemicals and outcomes. Overall prenatal exposures to four different types of PFAS were not statistically associated with changes in body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference. In contrast, for three chemicals, postnatal exposures were inversely related to changes in BMI (i.e., per log10 increase in PFOS: BMI z-score of -0.16 (95% CI: -0.22, -0.10)). There was no substantial heterogeneity in the reported measures of association within prenatal and postnatal subgroups. We observed modest small-study effects, but correction for these effects using the Trim and Fill method did not change our summary estimate(s).ConclusionOur review found no evidence of a positive association between prenatal PFAS exposure and pediatric obesity, whereas an inverse association was found for postnatal exposure. These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of studies.

The discovery of harmful components is the prerequisite for pollution control; however, this raises a great challenge on recognizing previously unknown species. Here we systematically review the analytical techniques on air pollution in the framework of an omics approach, with a brief introduction on sample preparation and analysis, and in more detail, compounds prioritization and identification. Through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS, typically coupled with chromatography), the complicated environmental matrix can be digitalized into full-component data. A key step to discover emerging compounds is the prioritization of compounds from massive data. Chemical fingerprints, suspect lists and biological effects are the most vital untargeted strategies for comprehensively screening critical and hazardous substances. Afterward, compressed data of compounds can be identified at various confidence levels according to exact mass and the derived molecular formula, MS libraries, and authentic standards. Such an omics approach on full-component data provides a paradigm for discovering emerging air pollutants; nonetheless, new technological advancements of instruments and databases are warranted for further tracking the environmental behaviors, hence to evaluate the health risk of key pollutants.

The evidence of the EPs' presence focuses on the detection of them, but there is a gap in information regarding is biomonitoring and their effects in health in Mexico. The presence of these pollutants in the country associated with lack of proper regulations in the discharge and disposal of EPs. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive view of the current environmental status, policies, and frameworks regarding Mexico's situation. The review also highlights the lack of information about biomonitoring since EPs are present in water even after their treatment, leading to a critical situation, which is high exposure to humans and animals.

Body distribution analyses suggested that PFHxS crossed the placental barrier reaching the fetus in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological data demonstrated impairment in the placenta with reduced blood sinus volume, placental labyrinth area as well as thickness of labyrinthine layer. Further lipidomic and transcriptomic data together showed that PFHxS exposure caused significant disruption in placental lipid homeostasis, including total lipid accumulation in the placenta, and dysregulation in phospholipid and glycerol lipid metabolism. Gene expression analyses uncovered elevation in key placental fatty acid transporters including op2, whereas protein expression showed transporter specific disruptions following exposure. Together, gestational exposure to human relevant level of PFHxS may increase the incidence of fetal deaths and caused placental dysplasia via disruption in lipid metabolism homeostasis.

The microbial communities in the environment are immensely diverse and critical mediators of various ecosystem processes. But it is not clearly known to what extent xenobiotics effect the composition and functionality of environmental microorganisms, across biomes in different geographic locations, with varying contaminating sources, categories of chemical pollutants, and their application types. Here, we investigated the impact of xenobiotics by meta-genomic analysis of 16S rRNA from seawater, soil, sludge and sediment, for deciphering microbial diversity, community structure, functional enrichment and metabolic potentiality in relation to the application of pesticide (metaldehyde), herbicide (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; DCPAA), insecticide (chlordecone) and flame retar-dant additives (organophosphate triesters; OPT and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate; TCEP). Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum consisting of Clostridia, in association with DCPAA (Lutispora sp.), metaldehyde and TCEP treatments. The next two abundant phyla were Proteobacteria [class Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria (Pelagibacter ubique with OPT treatment) and Gammaproteobacteria], and Euryarchaeota consisting mostly of Methanobacteria with chlordecone and DCPAA. Both Desulfomicrobium and Sedimentibacter were predominant in the subtropical moist forest sediment, while Synechococcus and Pelagibacter dominated the temperate Mediterranean Sea. Ruminococcus and Lutispora were more abundant in rain forest compared to waste water solid, while Anaerovorax predominated subtropical moist forest. Sequences involved in house-keeping genes comprised the most abundant hits. The genes involved in environmental information processing such as ABC transporters catalyzing carbohydrate uptake, membrane transport and quorum sensing were over-represented with TCEP, DCPAA, OPT and metaldehyde. Exposure to different classes of xenobiotics revealed major differ-ences in microbial structure and function abundances, mainly driven by environmental sources and biomes.

Different sampling events, WWTPs across the world, different treatment technologies, configurations, and processes, as well as different PFAS classes and compounds were considered. This study evaluated 13 PFAS analyzed predominantly in 161 WWTPs across the world. The statistical test results revealed that these 13 frequently detected and reported PFAS can be divided into four groups based on their behavior during wastewater treatment, namely (1) C6-10 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), (2) C4,5,11,12 PFCAs, (3) C4,6,8 perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and (4) C10 PFSA. In this study, biological treatments such as (1) membrane bioreactors, (2) combination of two or more biological treatments, and (3) biofilm processes revealed the highest PFAS removals, although the addition of a tertiary treatment actually had a nonbeneficial effect on PFAS removal. Moreover, a strong statistical correlation was observed between industrial wastewater sources and the presence of high influent PFAS concentrations in the receiving WWTPs.

Moving forward, we recommend additional research dedicated to understanding the behaviors of PFAS alternatives and other overlooked compounds (e.g., PFAS with chain length C2 and C3) during NF and RO processes.

This study developed a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) detection technique for dicofol, an environmental pollutant, for the first time using in-source fragmentation. The results confirmed that m/z 251 was the only precursor ion of dicofol after in-source fragmentation, and m/z 139 and m/z 111 were reasonable product ions. The main factors triggering the in-source fragmentation were the H+ content and solution conductivity when dicofol entered the mass spectrometer. Density functional theory can be used to analyze and interpret the mechanism of dicofol fragmentation reaction in ESI source. Dicofol reduced the molecular energy from 8.8 +/- 0.05 kcal/mol to 1.0 +/- 0.05 kcal/mol, indicating that the internal energy release from high to low was the key driving force of in-source fragmentation. A method based on HPLC-MS/MS was developed to analyze dicofol residues in environmental water. The LOQ was 0.1 mu g/L, which was better than the previous GC or GC-MS methods. This study not only proposed an HPLC-MS/MS analysis method for dicofol for the first time but also explained the in-source fragmentation mechanism of compounds in ESI source, which has positive significance for the study of compounds with unconventional mass spectrometry behavior in the field of organic pollutant analysis and metabonomics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1420-3049,,,,APR 27,2023,28,9,,,,,,,3765,10.3390/molecules28093765,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/molecules28093765,,,,,,,,37175171,,,,,WOS:000987405600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Substantial concern exists regarding the human health effects of PFAS, particularly metabolic syndrome (MetS), a precursor to cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality worldwide. This narrative review provides an overview of the PFAS literature on 4 specific components of MetS: insulin resistance/glucose dysregulation, central adiposity, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure. We focus on prospective cohort studies as these provide the best body of evidence compared to other study designs. Available evidence suggests potential associations between some PFAS and type-2 diabetes in adults, dyslipidemia in children and adults, and blood pressure in adults. Additionally, some studies found that sex and physical activity may modify these relationships. Future studies should consider modification by sex and lifestyle factors (e.g., diet and physical activity), as well quantifying the impact of PFAS mixtures on MetS features and related clinical disease. Finally, clinicians can follow recently developed clinical guidance to screen for PFAS exposure in patients, measure PFAS levels, conduct additional clinical care based on PFAS levels, and advise on PFAS exposure reduction.",,,,,,"Hall, Amber/0000-0002-8685-9953",,,,,,,,,,,,,1559-8276,1559-8284,,,,2023 MAR 15,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1177/15598276231162802,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/15598276231162802,,MAR 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000949869700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dispersion of PFAS in the environment has raised concerns because of their persistence and toxicity for living organisms. Both terrestrial and aquatic plants have been shown to take up PFAS from contaminated soil and groundwater, and to accumulate these compounds inside their tissues. Although PFAS generally exert a low toxicity on plants at environmentally relevant concentrations, they frequently impact biomass growth and photosynthetic activity at higher levels. Uptake, translocation, and toxicity of PFAS in plants have been well covered in literature. Although less attention has been given to the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant response to PFAS, recent studies based on -omics approaches indicate that PFAS affects the plant metabolism even a low concentration. The objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about the effects of PFAS on plants at the molecular level. Results from recent transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics studies show that low levels of PFAS induce oxidative stress and affect multiple plant functions and processes, including photosynthesis and energy metabolism.

The presence of PFAS in ground and surface water can create a route for PFAS to enter the soil, exposing ecosystems (including agroecosystems), where they will move through the food web via biomagnification. The toxicity of PFAS to plants, particularly in agricultural ecosystems, is of emerging concern due to the application of biosolids that are often contaminated with PFAS. Nevertheless, due to the low concentrations of PFAS in most agricultural soils, the direct impact of PFAS on plant health is not well understood. We used H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to explore the effects of exposure of two key PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism. We found that Arabidopsis exhibited an accumulation of multiple metabolites, including soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose), multiple amino acids, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, suggesting that PFAS exposure impacts the metabolism of plants by causing an accumulation of stress-related amino acids and soluble sugars that drives increased activity of the TCA cycle. The present study shows that H-1-NMR metabolomics is a viable tool for investigating changes in the metabolic profile of plants exposed to PFAS and can be used to illuminate the stress response of plants in a high-throughput, nonbiased manner.

In the present study, four microcosms were estab-lished to explore the impact of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) on bacterial communities in riverine and marine settings. PFOA distribution between the aqueous and sedimentary phases fluctuated in both PFOA-amended and unamended control systems. PFOA was more rapidly partitioned into the sediment in marine than in riverine microcosms. Differ-ences in iron concentration and salinity may influence PFOA exchange between water and sediment. In marine micro-cosms, the alpha diversity of bacterial communities was significantly correlated to PFOA concentration. PFOA tended to correlate more strongly with bacterial community composition in water than in sediment. At the whole system level, Lefse's analysis indicated Algoriphagus halophilus as biomarkers for PFOA exposure in both riverine and marine systems, and the family Flavobacteriaceae were also more abundant in the exposed systems. In terms of temporal variation (comparison between three time points in the systems), metastat analysis showed great variability of potential PFOA-sensitive bacteria at the genus level. As such, most PFOA-sensitive genera were transitory and variable and existed for a short term in different systems (river, sea, blank, and experiment) and phases.

This study examined the glucolipid metabolic changes in pregnant rats treated with relatively low dose perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) through oral gavage during pregnancy [gestational day (GD): 1-18]. We explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic perturbation. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and biochemical tests were performed to assess the glucose homeostasis and serum lipid profiles in pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats randomly assigned to starch, 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg.bw.d groups. Transcriptome sequencing combined with non-targeted metabolomic assays were further performed to identify differentially altered genes an d metabolites in the liver of maternal rats, and to determine their corre-lation with the maternal metabolic phenotypes. Results of transcriptome showed that differentially expressed genes at 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg.bw.d PFOS exposure were related to several metabolic pathways, such as peroxi-some proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) signaling, ovarian steroid synthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, insulin resistance, cholesterol metabolism, unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, bile acid secretion. The untargeted metabolomics identified 164 and 158 differential metabolites in 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg.bw.d exposure groups, respectively under negative ion mode of Electrospray Ionization (ESI-), which could be enriched in metabolic pathways such as alpha-linolenic acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glycerolipid metabolism, glucagon signaling pathway, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. Co-enrichment analysis indicated that PFOS exposure may disturb the metabolism pathways of glycerolipid, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, linoleic acid, steroid biosynthesis, glycine, serine and threonine. The key involved genes included down-regulated Ppp(1)r(3)c and Abcd(2), and up-regulated Ogdhland Ppp(1)r(3)g, and the key metabolites such as increased glycerol 3-phosphate and lac-tosylceramide were further identified.

Although many studies have reported an association between PFOA exposure and the risk of developing hepatic diseases, it is still in debate because they have shown conflicting results. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the relationship between PFOA exposure and hepatic diseases. Methods: This study searched studies related to hepatic diseases due to PFOA exposure until 31 December 2021, using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through research question development, literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation. This study found 8280 studies after excluding duplicate literature and selected 5 studies in the final stage. Among them, two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The results of the meta-analysis showed that the ALT of people exposed to PFOA was 117% higher than the ALT of those not exposed to PFOA, and it was significantly different (OR = 1.167; 95% CI, 1.086-1.254). Conclusion: However, since the number of studies included in the analysis was not large enough to conclude that PFOA exposure was associated with the development of hepatic diseases, more observational studies are needed to confirm its long-term effects.",,,,,,"Choi, Jihee/0000-0001-7801-7513; Kim, Jong-Yeon/0000-0003-4881-9325",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1660-4601,,,,SEP,2022,19,18,,,,,,,11318,10.3390/ijerph191811318,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/ijerph191811318,,,,,,,,36141595,,,,,WOS:000859667100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pesticide toxicity and bioaccumulation have brought up environmental issues, underlining the necessity for efficient removal techniques based on novel nanomaterials. Herein, biochar (BC) synthesized by using waste peels of citrus limetta embedded with green synthesized Fe2O3 nanoparticle by using green tea extract. By using PXRD analysis, the alpha phase of Fe2O3 confirmed. Endosulfan (ES) and Ethion (ET) pesticides are degraded photocatalytically using a sequential, BC@ Fe2O3 nanohybrid. At the pollutant concentration (50 mg L-1), with catalytic dose (25 mg) in acidic condition under natural sunlight, BC@ Fe2O3 showed to be extremely effective in the breakdown of pesticides. The higher removal of pesticides by BC@ Fe2O3 supported by higher value of zeta potential (-22.5 mV), enhanced surface area (74 m(2) g(-1)) and lower value of band gap (1.8 eV) as an effect of interactive characteristic and semiconducting behaviour. The fast decline in pesticide concentration followed by a gradual decrease demonstrated I-st order kinetics triggered by Langmuir adsorption. The availability of active species such as oxygen(,) hydroxyl radicals and holes, which are liable for pesticide breakdown, proved by scavenger analysis. Formation of safer metabolites during the photocatalytic studies confirmed by the LC-MS studies.

In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about PFAS in the environment, since they are difficult to break down through natural processes, are highly persistent in humans, animals, soils and waters, and can travel long distances in surface and groundwater. This has created an increased need for PFAS analysis. Most PFAS monitoring currently takes place using field sampling and chromatographic analytical methods, which are laboratory-based and are very costly when used to monitor PFAS in the environment. Using a semi-systematic literature review approach, a comparative study is conducted in this article on the available analytical methods and sensor technologies that can be used to monitor and detect PFAS in the environment, including chromatographic, instrumentation analysis, and sensor-based methods. This study considered four critical factors for effective and efficient monitoring methods, which include the type of PFAS detected, removing background levels, determining detection limits, and identifying samples. In general, other analytical instruments are used in conjunction with chromatographic techniques for detecting both target and non-target analytes at a lower level of detection (LOD). It is shown that even though some sensor types have a low LOD, they are only useful for detecting targeted PFAS in water samples.

PFAAs are widely detected in soils from many countries worldwide and their distribution is related to the emission of the fluorine-containing organic industry.

Many are highly toxic and accumulate both in soil and in organisms. Their biological transformation takes place by dehalogenation, in which the halogen substituents are detached from the carbon in the organic compound by enzymes produced by microorganisms. This increases the compounds' water solubility and bioavailability, reduces toxicity, and allows the resulting compound to become more susceptible to biodegradation. The microbial halogen cycle in soil is an important part of global dehalogenation processes. The aim of the study was to examine the potential of microbial communities inhabiting natural and anthropogenically modified environments to carry out the dehalogenation process. The potential of microorganisms was assessed by analyzing the metagenomes from a natural environment (forest soils) and from environments subjected to anthropopression (agricultural soil and sludge from wastewater treatment plants). Thirteen genes encoding enzymes with dehalogenase activity were identified in the metagenomes of both environments, among which, 2-haloacid dehalogenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase were the most abundant genes. Comparative analysis, based on comparing taxonomy, identified genes, total halogens content and content of DDT derivatives, demonstrated the ability of microorganisms to transform HOCs in both environments, indicating the presence of these compounds in the environment for a long period of time and the adaptive need to develop mechanisms for their detoxification.

The scientific literature on PFAS has increased dramatically in the last decade. Many stakeholders, including regulators, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and concerned individuals could benefit from an efficient way to access the health and toxicological literature related to PFAS. Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of the available peer-reviewed health or toxicological research for 29 PFAS. Methods: A protocol for conducting this systematic evidence map was initially published on Zenodo (Pelch et al. 2019c), then peer reviewed and published in Environment International (Pelch et al. 2019d) PubMed database was searched through January 25, 2021. Studies were screened for inclusion and exclusion according to the Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad and included any human, animal, and/or in vitro study that investigated exposure to one of the 29 PFAS of interest and a human health or toxicological effect. Selected study details were extracted from included studies as described in the protocol. Study appraisal was not conducted. The included studies and extracted meta-data are freely available in the online, interactive systematic evidence map at https://pfastoxdatabase.org. Results: Over 15,000 studies were retrieved from the PubMed literature searches. After manual screening, 1,067 studies were identified and included as investigating the health or toxicological effect of one or more PFAS of interest. There were 505 human, 385 animal, and 220 in vitro studies. Summary tables of the extracted data and overall observations are included in this report. Conclusions: The PFAS-Tox Database is a useful tool for searching, filtering, and identifying peer reviewed research on the health and toxicological effects of the included PFAS. In this summary of the evidence map we provide examples of data gaps and clusters revealed by the database, with the goal of helping direct future research efforts, facilitate systematic reviews (e.g. on immune effects, mixtures of PFAS, or effects of short chain PFAS), inform regulatory risk assessments, and improve opportunities for cross-disciplinary coordination.

An over-reliance on their application to crops to control pests can disturb ecosystems. Therefore, the scientific community and policymakers must be aware of the commitment and active stance they need to take up to effectively elaborate on solutions toward mitigating environmental contamination over the coming few years. We, therefore, reviewed the academic literature on bioremediation from 2018 to 2021 (the latest year of complete publication) to provide a meta-analysis of microbial systems capable of dissipating pesticides from agricultural soils. Natural attenuation can control lindane; however, it is time-consuming and unconvincing to scale. By introducing a suite of microorganisms into the system for substrate-specific biodegradation, we can boost the bioprocess and ultimately level up its cost-effectiveness. Options of microorganisms for bioaugmentation include the fungus Trametes versicolor and the bacteria Pigmentiphaga spp. and Paenanthrobacter spp. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation are enablers of environmental reclamation in agroecosystems. However, those biocatalytic strategies can be costly while manifesting as degraders to ecological sustainability. For instance, allochthonous and recombinant microorganisms can reduce genetic diversity by promoting antagonistic relationships. In addition, some stimulant minerals can be more toxic and harmful to beneficial non-target organisms than the target pesticide. Prudence and safety are significant aspects of ensuring environmentally safer applications for pesticide-degrading approaches.

Exposure to PFOS may alter gut microbiota and liver metabolic homeostasis in tammals, thereby increasing the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Diets high in soluble fibers can ameliorate metabolic disease risks. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the hypothesis that soluble fibers (inulin or pectin) could modulate he adverse metabolic effects of PFOS by affecting microbe-liver metabolism and interactions. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed an isocaloric diet containing different fibers: a) inulin (soluble), h) pectin (soluble), or c) cellulose (control, insoluble). The mice were exposed to PFOS in drinking water (3 ttgig per day) for 7 wk. Multi-omics was used to analyze mouse liver and cecum contents. RESULTS: In PFOS-exposed mice, the number of differentially expressed genes associated with atherogenesis and hepatic hyperlipidemia were lower in those that were fed soluble fiber than those fed insoluble fiber. Shotgun metagenomics showed that inulin and pectin protected against differences in microbiome community in PFOS-exposed vs. control mice. It was found that the plasma PFOS levels were lower in inulin-fed mice, and there was a trend of lower liver accumulation of PFOS in soluble fiber-fed mice compared with the control group.

As a technology-intensive product, large number of new synthetic chemicals are applied in LIBs production. Organic fluorine additives are added in multiple components of LIBs, many of these additives are novel per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (with fully fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon atom), here, in this work we referred to this kind of compounds as LIB-PFAS. LIB-PFAS may cause high exposure to personnel in contact with LIBs materials during production and disposal processes, thus posing potential health risks to these occupational workers. The general population can be exposed to LIB-PFAS when they are released into the surrounding air, soil, and water. In order to assess potential health risks associated with LIB-PFAS, this review systematically summarizes the chemical structures, analytical methods, possible emission routes and human exposure pathways, their bioaccumulation, distribution, and elimination behaviors in humans, and existing toxicity data of LIB-PFAS. In particular, the screening and identification methods for 57 LIB-PFAS are discussed, as well as the investigation of emission processes and exposure risks during the manufacturing and disposal of LIB.

However, few studies have considered their combined effects, which would be more representative of PFAS occurring in the environment. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a mixture of 18 PFAS at three environmentally relevant concentrations for 5 days to assess their bioconcentration and metabolic consequences. The burdens of n-ary sumation PFAS in zebrafish larvae were 0.12, 1.58, and 9.63 mg/kg in the 0.5, 5, and 50 mu g/L treatment groups, respectively. Exposure to the PFAS mixture accelerated hatching and larval heart rates, increased energy expenditure, and reduced ATP levels and glucose contents due to decreased feed intake and glucose uptake. Metabolomic analysis revealed that exposure to the PFAS mixture enhanced glycolysis but inhibited phospholipid synthesis, and significantly increased the expression of lipid metabolism related genes (srebf1, acox, and ppar alpha), which indicated enhanced beta-oxidation. The significant changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial content, and the transcription of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (mfn2, ndufs1, atp5fa1, and mt-nd1) and mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription (18rs-rrn, and polg1) suggested that exposure to the PFAS mixture could cause mitochondrial dysfunction and further disrupt glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, ultimately causing metabolic disorders in zebrafish larvae.

The best model was achieved using RF, while xenobiotics were shown to be highly relevant in transfer. The study reaffirms the transmission of certain metabolites, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), but also reveals additional insights into the maternal influence on the child's metabolome.

Many women endure PFD symptoms without seeking care. The Andersen's health behavior model explains health service utilization (HSU) using 4 domains: (1) individual needs for care, (2) resources or enabling factors, (3) predisposing factors, and (4) macrostructural/contextual factors. This study aims to apply this model to PFDs to determine the rate of HSUs in American women experiencing PFDs. The secondary objective was to examine HSU behavior using a variation of Andersen's model: the authors limited outcome variables to that of accessing PFD health services by any health care provider. As the normal Andersen's health behavior model covers broad personal health practices and general health behavior, this modification allowed for increased precision of individual predictors and relevance to urogynecology. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, the authors conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed, using search terms relevant to PFDs (in addition to disparities in care access). Included were studies of community-dwelling PFD symptomatic women living in the United States and quantitative and qualitative studies with primary and/or secondary aims addressing care-seeking or HSU behavior. For this study, PFDs were defined as AI, LUTSs, and POP. Extracted data were as follows: first author's last name, study aim, year of publication, study population geographic location, study participant demographics, PFD types, insurance, number of care-seekers and/or non-care-seekers, participant age, race/ethnicity, education, income, employment, body mass index, general health status, language used in study, symptoms, and other barriers and/or promotors identified. Overall, 44 publications were found that met the criteria of the study. Of these, 36 were quantitative, 5 were qualitative, and 3 were mixed-methods studies. The predominant focus of these studies was LUTSs (33/44 studies), whereas only 2 were on POP, 5 onmultiple PFDs, and 4 onAI. More than half were publishedmore than a decade ago (25/44), and themajority were based on self-reporting to national surveys. Women with symptomatic PFDs exhibited a 37% pooled prevalence of HSU, with determinants identified across the first 3 domains in the model only (macrostructural domains associated with HSU were not identified). For the first domain, quantitative studies demonstrated that PFD symptom severity and duration and preexisting depression were individual care needs associated with greater HSU behavior. Consistent with the quantitative data available in this study, qualitative data also demonstrated that facilitators of HSU were (1) longer symptom duration and (2) negative impact of PFD on quality of life. For the resources domain, established primary or secondary care and social support/networks increased HSU behaviors, but (oddly) higher income and employment were barriers to care. Of note, home remedy utilization was identified as a barrier to HSU in this category (taking of herbal supplements, use of diapers, and other self-management strategies). Predisposing factors noted to increase HSU in this study were age older than 50 years. Minority women were not well represented in this analysis, but notably, Asian women were significantly less likely to demonstrate HSU related to PFD. Qualitatively, there were no differences in socioeconomic status of women who did or did not show HSU, but the most common facilitator was awareness of PFD treatments, and common barriers included misinformation and normalization of pelvic floor symptoms. Limitations of this study include the possibility of missed publications with relevance (such as articles involving interstitial cystitis, sexual dysfunction, birth trauma, and others, as they are important aspects of PFDs). However, the team focused on studies related to common PFDs and their HSU, as opposed to peripheral analyses or pelvic floor conditions. Second, the study may be limited by using counts of themes and numbers of reporting studies in the overall qualitative analysis. Finally, significant heterogeneity in the studies indicates caution should be used in interpreting the operating room and pooled HSU rate for each identified determinant. The study indicates that designing inclusive interventions, building upon previous research frameworks, and addressing multilayered factors are all required for improving care-seeking rates of women with PFDs. To mitigate the glaring inequity in the United States of access to pelvic floor care, the authors recommend research focused on HSU for patients with POP or AI, implementation of multifaceted interventions, and investigations into macrostructural factors affecting HSU.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-7828,1533-9866,,,,DEC,2022,77,12,,,,,731,733,,10.1097/OGX.0000000000001115,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/OGX.0000000000001115,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000905200600011,View Full Record in Web of Science

Therefore, understanding the metabolic changes caused by PFOA exposure is of great significance to protect pregnant women from its adverse effects. In this study, the metabolomes from the urine samples of pregnant women exposure to PFOA at different degrees were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. The samples in different groups were distinguished and the differential metabolites were screened based on the VIP value, FC, and P-value of each comparison group through multivariate statistical analysis. The pathways related to differential metabolites were searched to reveal the effects of PFOA exposure on metabolic changes in pregnant women at different degrees. Finally, the ROC of differential metabolites was performed, and the differential metabolites with large area under the curve (AUC) values were selected and compared to identify the mutually differential metabolites. Meanwhile, these metabolites were fitted with a multivariable to explore if they could be used to distinguish different groups. The quantitative comparison of mutually differential metabolites revealed that the levels of L-cysteine, glycine, and 5-aminovaleric acid were positively correlated with the degree of PFOA exposure, indicating that different degrees of PFOA exposure could affect the synthesis or degradation of GSH and change the metabolism of oral or intestinal microbiota. Additionally, they may cause oxidative stress and abnormal fat metabolism in pregnant women.

Thus we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodsRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies comparing InterTAN with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), the Asian PFNA (PFNA-II), or the Gamma3 nail in treating IFF were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from inception to April 30, 2023. The differences in perioperative parameters and clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated by mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The risks of various complications and mortality were assessed by risk ratio (RR) with 95%CI.ResultsTwenty-three studies comprising 3566 patients were included. Compared with single-screw cephalomedullary nails (PFNA/PFNA-II, Gamma3), InterTAN conferred significantly reduced risk of implant failures (RR = 0.37, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.51, P < 0.001), hip and thigh pain (RR = 0.70, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.90, P = 0.006) and all-cause revision/reoperation (RR = 0.38, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.57, P < 0.001).

In the early 2020s, the need for personal protection due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased consumption of plastic materials (e.g., facemasks and gloves) and ultimately to increased plastic pollution, especially by PMFs. The PMFs present in the environment may be released in this form (primary particles) or in larger materials, that will release them as a result of environmental conditions. Although a considerable number of studies have been addressing the effects of microplastics, most of them studied round particles, with fewer studies focusing on PMFs. Thus, the current study aimed to summarize and critically discuss the available data concerning the ecotoxicological impact of PMFs on aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms exposed to PMFs showed accumulation, mainly in the digestive tract, and several toxic effects, such as DNA damage, physiological alterations, digestive damage and even mortality, suggesting that PMFs can pose a risk for the health of aquatic organisms. The PMFs induced toxicity to aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate organisms depends on size, shape, chemical association and composition of fibers. Regarding other size range (nm) of plastic fibers, the literature review highlighted a knowledge gap in terms of the effects of plastic nanofibers on aquatic organisms. There is a knowledge gap in terms of the interaction and modes of action of PMFs associated with other pollutants.

Conventional wastewater treatment processes are inadequate for removing persistent organic pollutants. Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are capable of removing PFASs from water through adsorption techniques. However, there is still constructive discussion on the potential of MOFs in adsorbing and removing PFASs for large-scale engineering applications. This review systematically investigates the use of MOFs as adsorbents for the removal of PFAS in water treatment. This primarily involved a comprehensive analysis of existing literature to understand the adsorption mechanisms of MOFs and to identify factors that enhance their efficiency in removing PFASs. We also explore the critical aspects of regeneration and stability of MOFs, assessing their reusability and long-term performance, which are essential for large-scale water treatment applications. Finally, our study highlights the challenges of removing PFASs using MOFs. Especially, the efficient removal of short-chain PFASs with hydrophilicity is a major challenge, while medium- to long-chain PFASs are frequently susceptible to being captured from water by MOFs through multiple synergistic effects. The ion-exchange force may be the key to solving this difficulty, but its susceptibility to ion interference in water needs to be addressed in practical applications. We hope that this review can provide valuable insights into the effective removal and adsorption mechanisms of PFASs as well as advance the sustainable utilization of MOFs in the field of water treatment, thereby presenting a novel perspective.",,,,,"Chen, Lingxin/H-5761-2019","Chen, Lingxin/0000-0002-3764-3515; li, jin hua/0000-0002-6069-9795",,,,,,,,,,,,,0743-7463,1520-5827,,,,FEB 1,2024,40,6,,,,,2815,2829,,10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c02939,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c02939,,FEB 2024,,,,,,38301280,,,,,WOS:001159207300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) is an organochlorine insecticide used worldwide. Several studies have reported the toxic effects of DDT and its metabolites on steroid hormone biosynthesis; however, its environmental effects are not well understood. This study examined wild rats collected in DDT-sprayed areas of South Africa and quantified plasma metabolites using liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-Q-TOF-MS). Fold change analysis of the metabolome revealed the effect of DDT on bile acid biosynthesis. Gene expression of the related enzyme in rat liver samples was also quantified. Significant association was found between DDT and gene expression levels related to constitutive androstane receptor mediated enzymes, such as Cyp2b1 in rat livers. However, our results could not fully demonstrate that enzymes related to bile acid biosynthesis were strongly affected by DDT. The correlation between DDT concentration and gene expression involved in steroid hormone synthesis in testis was also evaluated; however, no significant correlation was found. The disturbance of metabolic enzymes occurred in rat liver in the target area. Our results suggest that DDT exposure affects gene expression in wild rats living in DDT-sprayed areas. Therefore, there is a need for DDT toxicity evaluation in mammals living in DDT-sprayed areas. We could not find an effective biomarker that could reflect the mechanism of DDT exposure; however, this approach can provide new insights for future research to evaluate DDT effects in sprayed areas.",,,,,"Smit, Nico J/L-4905-2013; Motohira, Kodai/JFS-9260-2023","Smit, Nico J/0000-0001-7950-193X; Eguchi, Akifumi/0000-0001-5858-8132",,,,,,,,,,,,,0916-7250,1347-7439,,,,FEB,2023,85,2,,,,,236,243,,10.1292/jvms.22-0490,http://dx.doi.org/10.1292/jvms.22-0490,,,,,,,,36596564,,,,,WOS:001022956900017,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the potential hepatotoxic effects and mechanisms of low-level prenatal PFOS exposure in offspring remain ambiguous. The objective of this research was to examine the alterations in liver transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in offspring rats at postnatal day (PND) 30 following gestational and lactational exposure to PFOS (from gestational day 1 to 20 and PND 1 to 21). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into a control group (3% starch gel solution, oral gavage) and a PFOS exposure group (0.03 mg/kg body weight per day, oral gavage). Histopathological changes in liver sections were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical analysis was conducted to evaluate changes in glucose and lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were utilized to identify significant genes and metabolites associated with alterations of liver glucose and lipid metabolism through an integrated multi-omics analysis. No significant differences were found in the measured biochemical parameters. In total, 167 significant differ-entially expressed genes (DEGs) related to processes such as steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and fat digestion and absorption were identified in offspring rats in the PFOS exposure group. Ninety-five altered metabolites were exhibited in the PFOS exposure group, such as heptaethylene glycol, lysoPE (0:0/18:0), lucidenic acid K, and p-Cresol sulfate. DEGs associated with steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, fat digestion and absorption were significantly upregulated in the PFOS exposure group (P < 0.05). The analysis of correlations indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation between all identified differential metabolites and the levels of fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides in the PFOS exposure group (P < 0.05). Our findings demystify that early-life PFOS exposure can lead to alterations in transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in the offspring's liver, which provided mechanistic insights into the potential hepatotoxicity and developmental toxicity associated with environmentally relevant levels of PFOS exposure.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0147-6513,1090-2414,,,,JAN 15,2024,270,,,,,,,,115862,10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115862,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecoenv.2023.115862,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38157801,,,,,WOS:001165837200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n =37), endocrine (n =30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n=27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n=14), cancer (n=12), and urinary (n =11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were considered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PEAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PEAS may be used as replacements for legacy PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS.

Methods: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation. Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least two studies reporting the same domain. Results: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95%CI = -1.34 to -0.57), hip external rotation (-0.55;-1.07 to -0.03), hip extension (-0.72;-1.16 to -0.28), and knee extension (-0.97;-1.41 to -0.53) when compared to asymptomatic controls. People with PFOA also presented with smaller volumes of the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, tensor fascia lata, vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris when compared to asymptomatic controls. Also, people with PFOA presented with changes in muscle activation for the VL, VM and gluteus maximus (GMax) when compared to asymptomatic controls. Conclusion: People with PFOA present with lower strength and volume of the hip and quadriceps muscles and altered muscle activation of the VM, VL and GMax during ascending and descending stairs when compared to asymptomatic controls.

The kidney weight, kidney index, histopathological observation, serum biochemistry, transcriptomics, and metabolomics of the kidneys of the 35-day offspring mice were analyzed. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) levels in the kidney were measured. Transcriptome analysis results showed that 387 genes were up-regulated and 283 genes were down-regulated compared with the control group. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly concentrated in the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway and circadian rhythm. Compared with the control group, 64 and 73 metabolites were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the PFOA group. The altered metabolites were mainly enriched in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. PFOA can affect the expression levels of circadian rhythm-related genes in the kidneys of offspring mice, and this change is influenced by the PPAR signaling pathway.

A Systematic Review,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Seventy percent of women with pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) are estimated to present deficient consciousness of their pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) and poor ability to contract them. Improving the proprioception of PFMs, defined as the capacity to know the status and position of each body part, and adequately contracting them could be a protective factor to prevent the appearance of PFDs in the general female population. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of educational interventions and verbal instructions on how to contract and exercise the PFMs to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women. A systematic search of studies published in the last 20 years until March 2022 was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, Lilacs, and Dialnet databases. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity in the types of studies and included populations. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for the design, search, and reporting of studies. The methodological quality was analysed via the PEDro and the Newcastle-Ottawa scales in the case of randomised clinical trials and non-randomised studies, respectively, while the quality of evidence was determined using the SIGN grading system for evidence-based guidelines. Descriptive and experimental studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that evaluated the contractile capability of the PFMs in healthy women or women without a previous diagnosis of PFD were included. Seven articles that included a total of 2507 women were found, three of which were clinical trials with PEDro scores between 5 and 9 points out of 10 and four of which were non-randomised studies with NOS scores between 6 and 8 points out of 10. The outcomes were measured through vaginal palpation, visual observation, questionnaires for PFD symptoms, and self-perception reports. This review discriminated between two types of intervention, educational programmes and verbal instructions, and evaluated the changes observed in PFM strength and knowledgeability and the symptoms of PFDs. The findings showed that educational interventions and verbal instructions improve the proprioception of PFMs in women of all ages that are healthy or without a previous diagnosis of PFDs as well as their knowledge about the pelvic floor, healthy lifestyle habits, and symptoms that are potentially indicative of PFDs.

After exposure to mPFASs, the silkworm midgut was enriched with high levels of PFASs, which induced histopathological changes. The composition of the midgut microbiota was significantly affected by mPFAS exposure, and functional predictions revealed significant disruption of some metabolic pathways. RNA-seq analysis revealed that mPFASs significantly changed the transcription profiles. Functional enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes also revealed that biological processes related to metabolic pathways and the digestive system were significantly affected, similar to the results of the gut microbiota analysis, suggesting that mPFAS exposure had an adverse effect on the metabolic function of silkworms and may further affect their normal growth.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the impact of ED on PCa and the role of proteins in this process are not yet well understood. Here, two complementary computational approaches have been employed to investigate the molecular processes underlying the acquisition of malignancy in prostate cancer. First, the metabolic reprogramming associated with the chronic exposure to Aldrin in DU145 cells was studied by integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics via constraint-based metabolic modeling. Second, gene set enrichment analysis was applied to determine (i) altered regulatory pathways and (ii) the correlation between changes in the transcriptomic profile of Aldrin-exposed cells and tumor progression in various types of cancer. Experimental validation confirmed predictions revealing a disruption in metabolic and regulatory pathways. This alteration results in the modification of protein levels crucial in regulating triacylglyceride/cholesterol, linked to the malignant phenotype observed in Aldrin-exposed cells.",,,,,"Bedia, Carmen/H-9185-2015; Nielsen, Lars/A-5519-2011","Bedia, Carmen/0000-0003-4584-5843; Nielsen, Lars/0000-0001-8191-3511; Tauler, Roma/0000-0001-8559-9670",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2227-7382,,,,JUN,2023,11,2,,,,,,,11,10.3390/proteomes11020011,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/proteomes11020011,,,,,,,,37092452,,,,,WOS:001017754200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Internal Medicine Ward has a high consumption of antibiotics, particularly for gastroenteritis, typhoid, diabetic ulcer, urinary tract infection, and sepsis. The DDD/ATC systems applied in hospitals may provide valid data to evaluate antimicrobial usage as a global standard method. Objective: To explore the antibiotic use pattern in the internal medicine department based on the DDD/ATC system. Method: The authors explored articles from the database in PMC, Research Gate, and Google Scholar from July 11st, 2020, to July 21st, 2020. The authors included original articles/research, case reports, and meta-analyses from 2006 to 2020, which discussed DDD/100 patient-days or DDD/100 bed-days antibiotics in the internal medicine ward. A major criterion was to ensure all subjects in publications were adults aged above 18. Result: Penicillin is the most consumed (127.9 DDD/100 bed- days), followed by Cephalosporin (41.42 DDD/100-bed-days) and Fluoroquinolone (25.87 DDD/100 bed-days).

Elucidation of the role of environmental factors in metabolic and immune dysfunction leading to autoimmune disease is not yet well characterized. Objectives Here we investigated the impact of exposure to a mixture of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on the metabolome in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an experimental model of T1D. The mixture contained organochlorides, organobromides, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Methods Analysis of molecular lipids (lipidomics) and bile acids in serum samples was performed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, while polar metabolites were analyzed by GC-Q-TOF/MS. Results Experimental exposure to the POP mixture in these mice led to several metabolic changes, which were similar to those previously reported as associated with PFAS exposure, as well as risk of T1D in human studies. This included an increase in the levels of sugar derivatives, triacylglycerols and lithocholic acid, and a decrease in long chain fatty acids and several lipid classes, including phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins.

Exposure of omega-6 fatty acids to an oxidative environment results in the generation of a highly reactive carbonyl species known as trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). The timely and efficient detoxification of this metabolite, which has actions comparable to other reactive carbonyl species, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and methylglyoxal, is essential for disease prevention. However, the detoxification mechanism for tt-DDE remains elusive. In this study, the enzyme Aldh9a1b is identified as having a key role in the detoxification of tt-DDE. Loss of Aldh9a1b increased tt-DDE levels and resulted in an abnormal retinal vasculature and glucose intolerance in aldh9a1b-/- zebrafish. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that tt-DDE and aldh9a1b deficiency in larval and adult zebrafish induced insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis. Moreover, alterations in hyaloid vasculature is induced by aldh9a1b knockout or by tt-DDE treatment can be rescued by the insulin receptor sensitizers metformin and rosiglitazone. Collectively, these results demonstrated that tt-DDE is the substrate of Aldh9a1b which causes microvascular damage and impaired glucose metabolism through insulin resistance. Omega-6 fatty acids, prevalent in Western diets, are oxidized to form trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). This study reveals ALDH9a1b as a novel detoxifying system for tt-DDE, confirmed by a CRISPR KO line. Analysis of transcriptome, metabolomics, and molecular experiments shows that aldh9a1b mutation not only alters tt-DDE metabolism but induces diabetes and diabetic retinopathy, offering new insights into the omega-6-diabetes link.image",,,,,,"Klatt, Stephan/0000-0003-0064-3367; Wohlfart, David/0000-0001-9145-1904",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2198-3844,,,,JAN,2024,11,4,,,,,,,,10.1002/advs.202302325,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/advs.202302325,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38059818,,,,,WOS:001114978700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, they also pose an environmental and health concern given their ability to undergo hydrolysis and oxidation to several bioactive and persistent products, including the perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The metabolism of PAPs has been shown to occur in mammalian liver and intestine, however metabolism by the gut microbiome has not yet been investigated. In this study, human fecal samples were used to model the microbial population of the colon, to test whether these anaerobic microbes could facilitate 8:2 monosubstituted PAP (monoPAP) transformation. In vitro testing was completed by incubating the fecal samples with 8:2 monoPAP (400-10,000 nM) up to 120 minutes in an anaerobic chamber. Reactions were then terminated and the samples prepared for GC- and LC-MS/MS analysis. Metabolites of interest were the immediate hydrolysis product, the 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), and 11 additional metabolites previously shown to form from 8:2 FTOH in both oxic and anoxic environments. The kinetics of 8:2 monoPAP transformation by gut microbiota were compared to those in human S9 liver and intestine fractions, both of which have active levels of hydrolyzing and oxidative enzymes that transform 8:2 monoPAP. Transformation rates from 8:2 monoPAP to 8:2 FTOH were highest in liver S9 > intestine S9 > fecal suspensions. The gut microbiome also produced a unique composition of oxidative metabolites, where the following intermediate metabolites were more abundant than terminal PFCAs: 8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA) > 8:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA) > 7:2 Ketone approximate to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Hydrolytic and oxidative metabolites contributed up to 30% of the molar balance after microbial 8:2 monoPAP transformation.

Methods and results: A systematic literature search was conducted until November 2022. A total of 35 articles with 37,550 patients were included. Patients with SSS were associated with new-onset AF compared to those without SSS. Catheter ablation was associated with a lower risk of AF recurrence, AF progression, all-cause mortality, stroke and hospitalization of heart failure compared to pacemaker therapy.

Additionally, data regarding prevalence of lumbar disc degeneration and back pain in competitive swimmers were synthesized.SynthesisFour studies were included in the final analysis. Study quality and risk of bias were deemed adequate. There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 0.74) regarding data collected, population of swimmers, sample size, and methods. Therefore, a meta-analysis was not conducted. The majority of the studies included in this study (three of four) reported that swimmers have increased odds of developing lumbar DDD.

These findings are limited by significant differences in study methodology in the included studies. Although swimming is conventionally considered a low-impact sport, elite swimmers risk developing lower back pain and disc pathology, possibly because training involves unique biomechanics with repetitive rotational and hyperextension/flexion of the spine.

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrornbasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet alpha llb beta 3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (a delta SPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatrnent of the under lying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies.

This review presents data from 118 articles on the use of plant-based feed additives (PFAs) in Cyprinus carpio (common carp). Our review shows that most PFA research in carp is focused on improving feed and nutrient utilization efficiency along various levels (in vivo digestibility, metabolizability to in situ nutrient loading), while other half is focused on ensuring animal welfare standards (biomass, immunity, welfare). Several reviewed plant-based additives however tend to do both. The PFAs include essential oils (EOs), plant-part extracts (PPEs), medicinal plants (herbs) and spices. The effective inclusion rate of EOs is lower (0.5%-0.75%). Whereas PPEs, herbs and spices work at a generic inclusion rate of 2%-5% in carp feeds. Even at an optimum inclusion rate, there are factors controlling PFAs efficacy such as methods of preparation (reviewed). PFAs like lemon beebrush, geranium, dill, Rosemary pepper and common mallow with/without certain pre-conditions are better to avoid in cyprinid diets.

The subgroup results showed that PT and LBW were both associated with the occurrence of enamel hypoplasia (EHP) (OR = 6.89, 95% CI: 3.33-14.34; OR = 2.78, 95% CI: 2.10-3.68) rather than enamel opacity (OR = 0.94, 95% CI: 0.55-1.61; OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 0.66-1.61). There was no publication bias about the included studies (P = 0.75 > 0.05; P = 0.47 > 0.05). ConclusionThis meta-analysis demonstrated that both PT and LBW especially VLBW are associated with a higher risk of DDE in the primary dentition. PT and LBW are both related to the occurrence of EHP. However, the relationship between PT, LBW, and enamel opacity has not been verified.

However, the effect of OCPs on sperm quality remains controversial. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between environmental OCPs exposure and human semen parameters.Subject and methods A comprehensive search of articles before March 6, 2023, was conducted through PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase databases. The literature's quality was evaluated using a modified Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). STATA (Version 11.0) was used for meta-analysis, and relevant data were expressed as odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).Results Ten articles were analyzed in this meta-analysis, including six cross-sectional studies, three cohort studies, and one case-control study. These studies involved 5232 people in 10 countries. The results showed that there was an association between OCPs exposure and decreased human semen parameters (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.40-1.56), including decreased sperm volume (OR = 1.79, 95%CI = 1.15-2.79), decreased sperm count (OR = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.19-1.44), decreased sperm concentration (OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.10-1.63), impaired sperm motility (OR = 1.87, 95%CI = 1.16-3.01), and sperm morphology (OR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.02-1.99), respectively. Additionally, in sub-group analysis according to the type of OCPs, there was no association between DDE exposure and decreased semen parameters (OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.99-1.03). In sub-group analysis according to the location, the results indicated a positive association between OCPs and sperm morphology (OR = 2.22, 95%CI = 1.40-3.54) in North America. Moreover, in Europe, the results indicated a positive association between OCPs and decreased semen parameters (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.34-1.56), including decreased sperm volume (OR = 1.65, 95%CI = 1.06-2.58), decreased sperm count (OR = 1.71, 95%CI = 1.10-2.65), decreased sperm concentration (OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.04-1.74), and impaired sperm motility (OR=1.85, 95%CI = 1.11-3.08), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the combined OR had good stability and high reliability.

Despite extensive research on this topic, there is a need to clarify resilience concepts in the context of road freight transportation systems (FTSs) from a three-dimensional perspective (i.e., physical infrastructure, users, and managing organizations) and to identify persistent knowledge gaps concerning the characterization and measurement of FTS resilience vis-a-vis disruptive events. This paper addresses these shortcomings through a systematic review of 149 research studies. The synthesis of findings clarifies inconsistencies associated with the characteristics of FTS resilience and in so doing, establishes a unified framework for measuring FTS resilience through the life cycle of disruptive events.

Considering the relative dearth of information on water contamination and health outcomes in Appalachia, we conducted a systematic review of studies of microbiological and chemical drinking water contamination and associated health outcomes in rural Appalachia. We pre-registered our protocols, limiting eligibility to primary data studies published from 2000 to 2019, and searched four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library). We used qualitative syntheses, meta-analyses, risk of bias analysis, and meta-regression to assess reported findings, with reference to US EPA drinking water standards. Of the 3452 records identified for screening, 85 met our eligibility criteria. 93 % of eligible studies (n = 79) used cross-sectional designs. Most studies were conducted in Northern (32 %, n = 27) and North Central (24 %, n = 20) Appalachia, and only 6 % (n = 5) were conducted exclusively in Central Appalachia. Across studies, E. coli were detected in 10.6 % of samples (sample-size-weighted mean percentage from 4671 samples, 14 publications). Among chemical contaminants, sample-size-weighted mean concentrations for arsenic were 0.010 mg/L (n = 21,262 samples, 6 publications), and 0.009 mg/L for lead (n = 23,259, 5 publications). 32 % (n = 27) of studies assessed health outcomes, but only 4.7 % (n = 4) used case-control or cohort designs (all others were cross-sectional). The most commonly reported outcomes were detection of PFAS in blood serum (n = 13), gastrointestinal illness (n = 5), and cardiovascularrelated outcomes (n = 4). Of the 27 studies that assessed health outcomes, 62.9 % (n = 17) appeared to be associated with water contamination events that had received national media attention. Overall, based on the number and quality of eligible studies identified, we could not reach clear conclusions about the state of water quality, or its impacts on health, in any of Appalachia's subregions.

Three independent reviewers were involved in study selection, data extraction, and bias assessment. Risk of bias was evaluated by the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. DDE and its subtypes (demarcated opacities, hypoplasia, hypomineralized second primary molars (HSPM), and fluorosis) were regarded as exposure. Dental caries and clinical consequences of untreated caries were also assessed. In the meta-analyses, odds ratio (OR) was used in the random effects model for dichotomous outcomes. Quality of evidence was assessed using the Grading Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). Results: The search yielded 5,750 studies, 39 of which were included in the systematic review and 20 in the meta-analysis. The risk of bias ranged from 4 to 9 points. Children with DDE were more prone to primary tooth caries (OR=2.79; 95% CI:1.29-6.03), and so were those with demarcated opacities (OR=1.75; 95% CI:1.09-2.78), hypoplasia (OR=2.84; 95% CI:1.73-4.67), and HSPM (OR=2.89; 95% CI:1.65-5.06).

In this study, pomelo peel iron-loaded biochar (Fe-PBC) was added to an anammox bioreactor to alleviate the negative effects of PFOA. Results showed that the addition of Fe-PBC increased the ammonia and nitrite removal efficiencies from 77.7 +/- 9.6 % and 79.5 +/- 5.6 % to 94.45 +/- 5.1 % and 95.9 +/- 5.0 %, respectively. In addition, Fe-PBC promoted the removal of PFOA from wastewater, increasing the PFOA removal efficiency from 5.2 % to 29.2 +/- 4.3 % from 100 to 200 days. The intro-duction of iron-loaded biochar into the anammox bioreactor increased the C\\O ratio by 13.64 % by 150 days. In addition, a C_O fitting peak was detected in the Fe-PBC, indicating that the Fe-PBC was loaded with microorganisms. Microbial community analysis showed a decrease in the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Nitrospirae from 31 % and 3.4 % to 16.8 % and 0.9 %, respectively, while the relative abundance of Planctomycetes increased from 26.8 % to 44.1 %.

However, there is conflicting evidence regarding the incidence of peri-prosthetic fractures with each device. Several studies from the 1990s and a recent meta-analysis have shown a higher incidence of peri-prosthetic fractures in the short PFN cohort. Other studies have shown a lower reoperation rate with short PFNs, and no statistically significant differences have been quoted in the rates of peri-prosthetic fractures in systematic reviews. Aim The purpose of this retrospective study, therefore, was to assess the peri-prosthetic fracture rate and failure rates of elderly neck of femur (NOF) fractures implanted with either a short or long proximal femoral nail (PFN). Materials and methods A retrospective study was conducted in a single orthopaedic department (University Hospital Dorset, Poole, GBR) using collected data on all extracapsular neck of femur fracture patients from the national hip fracture database (NHFD) from January 1, 2011, to December 23, 2021. The data collected included patient age, sex, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) type of neck of femur fracture, type of surgery performed, any further peri-prosthetic fractures, and time to re-operation in that subset of the group. The implants used were the Stryker Gamma 3 Nail and the Smith Nephew (Trigen and Intertan). All patients were allowed to fully weight bear as tolerated and received both orthopaedic and elderly medical care. Failure was defined as a cut-out or implant fracture. Results From January 1, 2011, to December 23, 2021, there were 1010 extracapsular neck of femur fractures recorded on the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) treated with a PFN from the study centre. Of those patients, 11 had pathological fractures and were excluded. 649 patients had long PFNs, and 350 had short PFNs. Of the total of 999 patients, 254 (25%) were male and 745 (75%) were female. More than 80% of the patients in the sample were over the age of 75. The majority of patients in both groups had A1/A2 fractures (short 84.3%, long 49.1%). The rate of periprosthetic fractures in the short PFNs was 1.71%, and the failure rate was 0.57%. The rate of periprosthetic fractures in the long PFNs was 0.62%, with a failure rate of 0.92%. The multi-nominal logistic regression model did not show statistically significant odds ratios (OR) for the following variables: long/short nails, male/female gender, age, ASA, or type of fracture. The female gender was associated with a higher risk of both periprosthetic fractures and failures (OR of 2.232 and 2.95), but this was not found to be statistically significant. Similarly, unstable A3 fractures had a much higher risk of failure (OR of 2.691) compared to periprosthetic fractures (OR of 0.985). However, this was not statistically significant. Conclusion Overall, this study has identified that in a patient population that is predominantly female and over the age of 75, the risk of periprosthetic fracture rate and the failure rate is similar in both the use of a short or a long PFN for intertrochanteric fractures.",,,,,,"Nasim, Omer/0000-0003-0747-8739",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2168-8184,,,,DEC 23,2022,14,12,,,,,,,E32892,10.7759/cureus.32892,http://dx.doi.org/10.7759/cureus.32892,,,,,,,,36578855,,,,,WOS:000919787000041,View Full Record in Web of Science

The landfill environmental condition accelerates the disintegration of plastics that ultimately turned into the emerging contaminant, microplastics (MPs). MPs disseminate in the peripheral environmental matrices through runoff and leachate leakage. Besides, MPs have the affinity for both organic and inorganic micropollutants to adsorb on their sur-face and assist in the amplification of many emergent micro-organic (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)) and inorganic (e.g., heavy metals) pollutants. This mini-review conducts a literature review on the current publications on MPs in landfills and their contribution to emergent micropollutants in landfill sites.",,,,,"Rahman, Mostafizur/IYJ-9487-2023; Alam, Mahbub/IUM-5543-2023","Alam, Mahbub/0000-0001-9713-4336; Rahman, Md.

These chemicals are eventually taken up by aquatic organisms, where they can cause harmful effects. However, knowledge gaps related to the connections between hydrological, chemical, and biological processes currently limit our ability to forecast potential future changes in contaminant concentrations accurately. In this study, concentrations of three pesticide classes (organochlorines, organophosphates, and herbicides) and a standard suite of trace metals were analyzed in the South Saskatchewan River, Canada in 2020 and 2021 in water, sediments, and fishes. Organochlorine pesticides have been banned in Canada since the 1970s, yet there were some detections for methoxychlor and lindane, predominantly in sediment and fish samples, which could be attributed to legacy contamination. Except for malathion and parathion, organophosphate pesticides were scarcely detected in both sampling years in all matrices, and neonicotinoids were below detection in all samples. Conversely, the herbicides 2,4-D and dicamba were detected consistently throughout all locations in water samples for both sampling years. Overall, concentrations were 3 times higher in 2020 when river discharge was similar to 2 times higher, suggesting run-off from the surrounding catchment or disturbance of contaminated sediments. Analysis for trace metals revealed that Cu and Zn exceeded sediment quality guidelines in some locations. Mercury concentrations exceeded the guidelines for about 18% of the samples (water and sediment) analyzed. These findings fill gaps in monitoring datasets and highlight key links between hydrology and chemistry that can be further explored in computational models to predict future contaminant trends in freshwater systems.",,,,,"Brinkmann, Markus/L-3879-2013","Brinkmann, Markus/0000-0002-4985-263X; Prajapati, Saurabh/0000-0001-7114-8035",,,,,,,,,,,,,0045-6535,1879-1298,,,,DEC,2022,308,,1,,,,,,136236,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2022.136236,,SEP 2022,,,,,,36057354,,,,,WOS:000858859700002,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, little is known about the role of root exudates on 6:2 FTOH biodegradation in the rhizosphere. This study examined the effects of root exudates produced from dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) and monocot (Brachypodium distachyon) grown under different nutrient conditions (nutrient -rich, sulfur -free, and potassium -free) on 6:2 FTOH biotransformation with or without bioaugmentating agent Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. All the exudates enhanced defluorination of 6:2 FTOH by glucose -grown RHA1. Amendment of dicot or monocot root exudates, regardless of the plant growth conditions, also enhanced 6:2 FTOH biotransformation in soil microcosms. Interestingly, high levels of humic-like substances in the root exudates are linked to high extents of 6:2 FTOH defluorination. Bioaugmenting strain RHA1 along with root exudates facilitated 6:2 FTOH transformation with a production of more diverse metabolites. Microbial community analysis revealed that Rhodococcus was predominant in all strain RHA1 spiked treatments. Different root exudates changed the soil microbiome dynamics. This study provided new insight into 6:2 FTOH biotransformation with different root exudates, suggesting that root exudates amendment and bioaugmentation are promising approaches to promote rhizoremediation for PFAS-contaminated soil.",,,,,,"Chu, Kung-Hui/0000-0002-4212-1789",,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3894,1873-3336,,,,MAR 15,2024,466,,,,,,,,133651,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133651,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2024.133651,,FEB 2024,,,,,,38309165,,,,,WOS:001178485300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

After many years of development, DDT has been extended to geological investigation and disaster management for tunnel engineering, aquifer reconstruction at the bottom of coal mines, pumping channel construction for power storage stations, municipal pipeline laying and other fields. Combined with the advantages of DDT for long-distance accurate crossing, ground grouting technology can achieve safe and efficient management of underground engineering disasters, and has a broad application prospect. This paper systematically reviews the development history, research status and key technologies of DDT. Firstly, the development history of DDT is introduced. Secondly, the scientific research plan, academic paper publication, relevant patent authorization, and application exploration of DDT are analysed. The analysis results show that the DDT in China has reached an internationally advanced level of technological independence and broad-range application, but there are still some core technical problems that need to be resolved, such as thousand-meter long-distance fast drilling, accurate drilling guidance in complex geological conditions, and accurate grouting in underground engineering. Focusing on the construction requirements of strategic major projects, this paper proposes four functional modules, i.e., forecasting, drilling, grouting and detecting, and analyses and discusses six aspects of ultra-long directional drilling and grouting (i.e., sensing prediction while drilling, rapid drilling and sticking prediction, precision guidance technology, remote gel controllable grouting material, pressure stabilizing and controlling sectional grouting process, and detection system with drilling).

Given that groundwater is a crucial resource in this region, a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the current state of knowledge on the presence of pesticides in aquifers. The review examined 48 research papers published between 1998 and 2020, and found that only six countries in the region have information on pesticides in groundwater. A total of 70 agrochemicals were detected, encompassing legacy pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and metabolites. Herbicides, including the widely used atrazine and glyphosate, were the most commonly detected current-use pesticides. These herbicides are being gradually banned or restricted due to their potentially harmful effects on the environment. Factors that contribute to the presence of these contaminants in aquifers include preferential flows, seasonal variations in rainfall, aquifer type, unsaturated zone thickness, and land use and management practices. Researchers noted that analysis of these contaminants is often beyond the economic or methodological scope, and analytical capacity in the region is generally limited.

In the present study, a sensitive and rapid high-performance thin-layer chromatography method was developed for the simultaneous determination of marmelosin, umbelliferone, and psoralen from the four different aerial parts of A. marmelos. The method uses HPTLC silica gel 60 RP-18 W plates as stationary phase, and acetonitrile: 0.1% orthophosphoric acid in water (1:1 v/v) as solvent system. The developed method is validated for specificity, precision, repeatability, and accuracy in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Further, the estimation of heavy metal suggested that the A. marmelos bark sample was highly contaminated with cadmium (3.8 +/- 0.7 mu g/g) which was far from the permissible range as described by World Health Organization (WHO). The observed chromium concentration was higher in the bark and the fruit than the normal range recorded in the plants. Arsenic and lead content was within the permissible range, while mercury was not detected in any of the tested samples. Studied samples were further tested for the presence of organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticides, as well as organophosphate and carbamates. Results suggested that gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (gamma-HCH) was more prominent and detected in the bark and the young twig samples. Carbamates were not detected in any of the samples.

There are a lot of traditional methods to detect pesticides, among them gas chromatography (GC), high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), and their combinations with ultraviolet (UV) or mass spectroscopy. Nevertheless, these conventional techniques have several limitations, involving complicated pre-treatment steps, requiring expensive instruments, operational difficulty, lack of instrument portability, and difficulties in real-time monitoring. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is one of the current leading techniques widely applied for the ultrasensitive detection of pesticides molecules. SERS takes advantage to combine the high specificity of Raman scattering with the signal amplification of electromagnetic enhancement provided by the excitation of surface Plasmon resonances in metallic nanostructures, together with the charge transfer mechanisms established between metal surfaces and analytes. In this brief review, types of classification of pesticides that can be classed have been reported. These classifications can provide valuable information on the chemistry of pesticides. The state of art of SERS, including a theoretical background study, is briefly described. Finally, some recent development and applications of optical and analytical techniques for pesticides detection have been summarized; a particular study will be focused on SERS combined with microfluidic technology that has appeared as advanced tools for surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).

An electronic search was conducted until March 2022 using Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Science-Direct, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCO-Host, EMBASE, and Google Scholar and complemented with a manual search, with no restrictions on language or date of publication. Longitudinal studies of children under 6 years of age with primary dentition were included. A total of 1158 studies were found, of which 651 records were reviewed by title and abstract, and 24 articles were selected for full-text evaluation. Finally, nine studies that met the selection criteria were included in the quali-tative synthesis. Study quality and certainty were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Three cohort studies of good quality were included in the meta-analysis. A risk associated with DDE (RR = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.52-2.49) and a risk associated with enamel hypoplasia (RR = 5.45; 95% CI: 1.84-16.14) were found.

However, its utilisation is hampered by the presence of micropollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Previous studies indicate that the type and amount of micropollutants can be significantly adjusted by selecting the right process parameters. This literature review provides an overview of how (1) pyrolysis temperature, (2) carrier gas flow and type, (3) heating rate, and (4) residence time affect the concentration of micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge. The micropollutants targeted are those listed by the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and by the International Biochar Institution (IBI), including PAHs, PCDD/Fs, PCBs and VOCs. In addition, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are also considered due to their presence in sewage sludge. The findings suggest that higher pyrolysis temperatures reduce micropollutant levels. Moreover, the injection of a carrier gas (N2 or CO2) during the pyrolysis and cooling processes effectively lowers PAHs and PCDD/Fs, by reducing the contact of biochar with oxygen, which is crucial in mitigating micropollutants. Nevertheless, limited available data impedes an assessment of the impact of these parameters on PFAS in biochar. In addition, further research is essential to understand the effects of carrier gas type, heating rate, and residence time in order to determine the optimal pyrolysis process parameters for generating clean biochar.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0956-053X,1879-2456,,,,FEB 15,2024,174,,,,,,618,629,,10.1016/j.wasman.2023.12.036,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wasman.2023.12.036,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38154418,,,,,WOS:001156090800001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Supported cobalt is preferred, and the choice of support is critical to the success of the process. For this, graphene materials have grown in interest due to their unique and appreciable characteristics. Thus, this study aims to perform a systematic review of previous studies which evaluated the use of graphene materials as support means for cobalt FTS catalysts. Twelve studies from the last five years were selected for extraction and analysis of results. The main parameters that influenced the catalytic activity of FTS catalysts were discussed, such as the type of support used, the chosen preparation method, and the graphene functionalization method. The results showed that the catalysts synthesized from different types of graphene support obtained CO conversion rates between 20 and 86.9% and high selectivity for C5 + compounds in the gasoline range. Furthermore, the functionalization of graphene with functional groups and pretreatment with nitric acid was essential to adjust the metal-support interaction and ensure catalytic efficiency. The preparation of catalysts involves a series of parameters that must be considered to ensure that the Co/C ratio produces an optimal particle size, consequently presenting better efficiency.

The traditional preferred surgical approach for pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is vaginal hysterectomy (VH) with or without pelvic floor repair. Uterine pathology treatments via hysterectomy for women, including premalignant conditions and fibroids, typically opt for the VH route. A shorter recovery time and faster return to daily activities have been associated with VH, as this procedure leaves no large abdominal incision (which may produce further wound-related complications and higher levels of pain during the recovery process). A proposed preemptive anesthetic modality aimed at minimizing postoperative pain (as well as narcotic and opioid consumption) is the application of infiltration of local anesthetics during pelvic floor reconstructive surgeries. This study aimed to evaluate infiltration of local anesthetics and their impact on perioperative outcomes for women, as well as postoperative pain for patients undergoing VH for the surgical management of PFDs. Abstract selection took place via 3 authors (A.P., A.D., and D.Z.), who used the following meta-analysis inclusion criteria: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing outcomes of patients undergoing VH due to PFDs and/or other benign indications (ie, fibroids, uterine bleeding, precancerous conditions) and received either intraoperative infiltration with local analgesic or not. Comparator groups consisted of VH-eligible patients who received placebo injections of normal saline solution in place of local anesthetic. Main outcomes of the study were postoperative pain scores and opioid use. Excluded studies were any case reports, nonrandomized trials, or animal studies. The databases searched for articles published up to January 2022 included MEDLINE (1966-2022), Scopus (2004-2022), Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Authors retrieved the full text of those studies deemed to meet the criteria. Overall, 5 RCTs were included in the analysis. Their data included 277 women who underwent a VH, with the local analgesia (LA) group patients, or those receiving preemptive local infiltration analgesia, consisting of 139 patients, whereas the control group (patients in the non-LA group who received no preemptive LA) included 138 patients. The main analgesic regimen was 0.5% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine followed by 0.5% ropivacaine. Total anesthetic injection amounts ranged from 20 to 50 mL from study to study. In addition, injection sites exhibited variation, but the uterosacral ligaments were the most prevalent sites of local analgesic injection. Also, opioid-based consumption up to 24 hours postoperatively was significantly reduced in the LA group when compared with the non-LA group (197 patients). Overall, the average postoperative scores at both 30 minutes to 2 hours and 3 to 6 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the LA group when compared with the non-LA group. Despite this, the postoperative pain scores later up to 24 hours postoperatively did not differ between groups. A major strength of the study was the authors' choice to set aside data restrictions to eliminate data losses. This study is the first to present outcomes from existing RCTs of local infiltration analgesia use before surgical incision during VH. Limitations of the study include a limited number of existing studies from which data were pulled, thereby hindering the ability to draw safe conclusions. The relatively small level of evidence could hinder accurate summaries of local anesthetic effects, with the possibility of overestimation/underestimation on the identified effects. The authors included some studies that were not yet published at the time of review. An additional weakness was the variation of the methodological quality of recruited studies due to design differences, included populations, and methodology. Significant heterogeneity was detected in areas such as analgesic regimens utilized, injected dosage, injection locations, and indication for surgery. Preemptive application of LA in patients undergoing VH for PFDs appears as a safe and beneficial use of anesthetic in terms of hospital stay, opioid use, and short-term postoperative pain. However, additional studies would be required to identify dosages, the optimal anesthetic regimen, and application sites to achieve the peak postoperative benefit.",,,,,"Grigoriadis, Themistoklis/AAJ-2269-2021; Kathopoulis, Nikolaos/AAK-1373-2021","Grigoriadis, Themistoklis/0000-0002-4301-8775; Kathopoulis, Nikolaos/0000-0002-0031-809X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0029-7828,1533-9866,,,,JAN,2023,78,1,,,,,22,23,,10.1097/OGX.0000000000001118,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/OGX.0000000000001118,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000916521100009,View Full Record in Web of Science

The objective of the present study was to characterize the metabolic profiles underpinning the associations between POPs and endometriosis risk. Methodology: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in France to recruit women with and without surgically confirmed deep endometriosis. Women's serum was analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to high -resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to measure the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) and per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). A comprehensive metabolomic profiling was conducted using targeted HRMS and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) to cover polar and non -polar fractions. A meet -in -the -middle statistical framework was applied to identify the metabolites related to endometriosis and POP levels, using multivariate linear and logistic regressions adjusting for confounding variables. Results: Fourteen PCBs, six OCPs and six PFAS were widely found in almost all serum samples. The pesticide trans-nonachlor was the POP most strongly and positively associated with deep endometriosis risk, with odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) of 2.42 (1.49; 4.12), followed by PCB180 and 167. Women with endometriosis exhibited a distinctive metabolic profile, with elevated serum levels of lactate, ketone bodies and multiple amino acids and lower levels of bile acids, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), cortisol and hippuric acid. The metabolite 2hydroxybutyrate was simultaneously associated to endometriosis risk and exposure to trans-nonachlor. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive metabolome-wide association study of endometriosis, integrating ultra -trace profiling of POPs. The results confirmed a metabolic alteration among women with deep endometriosis that could be also associated to the exposure to POPs. Further observational and experimental studies will be required to delineate the causal ordering of those associations and gain insight on the underlying mechanisms.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,MAR 25,2024,918,,,,,,,,170678,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170678,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2024.170678,,FEB 2024,,,,,,38316313,,,,,WOS:001178870400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, its effects on immunity of marine invertebrates at environmentally realistic levels are still largely unknown. In this study, the immunotoxicity of PCP to a representative bivalve species was evaluated. In addition, its impacts on metabolism, energy supply, detoxification, and oxidative stress status were also analysed by physiological examination as well as comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to reveal potential mechanisms underpinning. Results illustrated that the immunity of blood clams was evidently hampered upon PCP exposure. Additionally, significant alterations in energy metabolism were detected in PCP-exposed clams. Meanwhile, the expressions of key detoxification genes and the in vivo contents (or activity) of key detoxification enzymes were markedly altered. Exposure to PCP also triggered significant elevations in intracellular ROS and MDA whereas evident suppression of haemocyte viability. The abovementioned findings were further supported by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses.

Although its neurotoxicity has been reported, the underlying mechanism and subsequent detoxification remain unclear. In this study, embryos and adult zebrafish were exposed to PCP to determine its potential neurotoxic mechanism and protective indicators. The survival rate, heart rate, mobility time, active status and moving distance were significantly decreased in larvae after 30 mu g/L PCP exposure. Likewise, the mobile time, latency to the first movement, velocity and moving distance of adult zebrafish were significantly reduced by PCP exposure. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of larvae revealed that arginine and proline metabolism was the primary pathway affected by PCP exposure, reflected by increased proline and decreased citrulline (CIT) contents, which were confirmed by quantitative data. PCP exposure suppressed the conversion from arginine to CIT in larvae by downregulating the expression of nos1 and nos2a. Ornithine content was increased in the brains and intestines of adult zebrafish after PCP exposure, which inhibited ornithine catabolism to CIT by downregulating otc, resulting in reduced CIT. Intriguingly, CIT supplementation significantly restored the neurobehavioral defects induced by PCP in larvae and adult zebrafish. CIT supplementation upregulated the expression of ef1 alpha and tuba1 in larvae and inhibited the downregulation of ef1 alpha in the brains of adult zebrafish.

This has led to the development of new analytical and multi-class analysis methods for the assessment of a broad range of organic pollutants in various population groups, ranging from small-scale studies to advanced studies with a large number of participants based on different exposure settings. This meta-analysis summarizes the existing literature on the assessment of organic pollutants in hair in terms of residue levels, the correlation of hair residue levels with those of other biological matrices and socio-demographic factors, the reliability of hair versus other biomatrices for exposure assessment, the use of segmental hair analysis for chronic exposure evaluation and the effect of external contamination on hair residue levels. Significantly high concentrations of organic pollutants such as pesticides, flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were reported in human hair samples from different regions and under different exposure settings. Similarly, high concentrations of pesticides (from agricultural activities), flame retardants (E-waste dismantling activities), dioxins and furans were observed in various occupational settings. Moreover, significant correlations (p < 0.05) for hair and blood concentrations were observed in majority of studies featuring pesticides and flame retardants. While among sociodemographic factors, gender and age significantly affected the hair concentrations in females and children in general exposure settings, whereas adult workers in occupational settings. Furthermore, the assessment of the hair burden of persistent organic pollutants in domestic and wild animals showed high concentrations for pesticides such as HCHs and DDTs whereas the laboratory-based studies using animals demonstrated strong correlations between exposure dose, exposure duration, and measured organic pollutant levels, mainly for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, terbuthylazine, aldrin, dieldrin and pyrethroid metabolites.

Exposure to environmental factors such as air pollution and heavy metals has been linked to low BMD. This study aimed to review the emerging evidence investigating the associations between exposure to environmental chemicals and human bone mineral density or the risk of osteoporosis. A comprehensive electronic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase up to March 3, 2022. Beta coefficients were extracted with 95% confidence intervals to calculate pooled mean differences for BMD in random effect models. For data synthesis, main exposure groups were identified using the Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Overall, 3181 records were identified. We reviewed 27 English articles with an analytical observational study design. In quantitative analysis, exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was significantly associated with low spinal BMD among women (mean difference = - 0.01 g/cm2, 95% CI - 0.02 to - 0.004 g/cm2). Up to date, there is supportive evidence for the inverse associations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and phthalates with BMD. The association of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with BMD seems to vary by specific urinary PAHs and bone sites.

Micro-plastics and nano-plastics remain major emerging pollutants and threaten the environment, ecosystem, human health, and well-being. Micro-nanoplastics (MNPs) are also exposed to humans through cosmetics, inhalation, ingestion, drinking water, dietary sources, and drug formulations. Oral uptake is the major among the different exposure routes of MNPs to humans. After entry, it gets absorbed due to its nano size (<100 nm) and easily distributed to all parts of the body through blood, affecting multiple organs, especially vital organs of the human body leading to severe diseases. It causes cancer, heart, liver, and kidney diseases, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and affects the brain. Its adsorption with protein leads to multi-layered corona formation in human blood plasma. MNPs interact with immune cells and induce pro-inflammatory mediators, inflammatory reactions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and associated cytotoxicity. MNPs suppress T lymphocyte activity which results in a lack of immune regulation leading to autoimmune diseases. Hence, it is necessary to understand the impact of MNPs exposure on humans. Strict control measures for the production and use of plastics and developing appropriate strategies for safe disposal would prevent MNPs-mediated toxicity in humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2069-5837,,,,,AUG 15,2023,13,4,,,,,,,381,10.33263/BRIAC134.381,http://dx.doi.org/10.33263/BRIAC134.381,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000885522800019,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the impacts of various bromide ion (Br-) concentrations on the phytotoxicity, uptake and fate of SAs in plant growth and physiological metabolism of plants have not been well understood. Our research demonstrated that low concentrations of Br- (0.1, 0.5 mM) promoted the uptake and degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) in wheat and attenuated the phytotoxicity of SDZ. Additionally, we proposed a degradation pathway and identified the brominated product of SDZ (SDZBr), which attenuated the dihydrofolate synthesis inhibition by SDZ. The primary mechanism was that Br-reduced the level of reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) and alleviated oxidative damage. The production of SDZBr and the high consumption of H2O2 suggest the potential generation of reactive bromine species, contributing to the degradation of the electron-rich SDZ and thus reducing its toxicity. Moreover, metabolome analysis of wheat roots indicated that low concentrations of Br- stimulated the production of indoleacetic acid under SDZ stress, promoting growth and enhancing the uptake and degradation of SDZ. Conversely, high Br- (1 mM) concentration produced a deleterious effect. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic removal, suggesting a potentially novel approach to plant-based antibiotic remediation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,OCT 1,2023,893,,,,,,,,164857,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164857,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164857,,JUN 2023,,,,,,37321499,,,,,WOS:001025912000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The key photosynthesis related genes (PsaA, PsaB, PsbA, PsbB, PsbC, and PsbD) were significantly down-regulated. The ultrastructure of mesophyll cells was destroyed with chloroplast swelling, membrane surface blurring, irregular thylakoid lamellar structure, and number of peroxisomes increased. PS-MPs mitigated FF toxicity, and the IBR index values showed that 10 mg & BULL;L-1 PS-MPs were more effective. Metabolomic analysis revealed that the abundance of metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered by FF, was greater than the combined MPs-FF contamination. The metabolism of amino acids, sugars, and organic acids were severely interfered. Among these, 15 metabolic pathways were significantly altered, with the most significant effects on phenylalanine metabolism and the citric acid cycle (p < 0.05).",,,,,"Wen, Yue/GYQ-5844-2022; Wen, Yuezhong/A-7651-2011","Wen, Yuezhong/0000-0002-7871-7699",,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3894,1873-3336,,,,OCT 5,2023,459,,,,,,,,132176,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132176,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2023.132176,,JUL 2023,,,,,,37523959,,,,,WOS:001052114600001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, antibiotics promote antibiotic-resistance bacteria (ARB) which represent another emerging pollutant. However, the interaction between antibiotic and ARB in the obesogenic effects remained unexplored. In the present study, the obesogenic effects of tetracycline antibiotic (TCH) and ARB containing tetA were studied on C. elegans, and E. coli OP50 (OP50) was referred as a normal bacterial food. Results showed that TCH stimulated nematode triglyceride contents, while ARB alone had no significant influences. The combination of TCH and ARB showed less obesogenic effects than TCH alone, showing antagonism. Biochemical assays showed that the combination of TCH and ARB showed similar effects to ARB alone, and had less increases in lipid metabolism enzymes or metabolites than those of TCH or ARB alone, supporting the antagonism. In the nontargeted metabolomic analysis, TCH with ARB showed less significantly changed metabolites (SCMs) in the nematodes than TCH or ARB alone, partially explaining the antagonism. The metabolomic results also pointed out the significant involvement of amino acids, the carboxylic acids and derivatives, and also the benzene and substituted derivatives in the obesogenic effects of TCH and ARB.

The degradation performance of CBZ by UV driven bisulfite process was investigated in this work. The kinetics results indicated that CBZ was high-efficiently degraded by UV/bisulfite following a pseudo first-order kinetic model (K-obs = 0.0925 min(-1)). SO4 center dot- and center dot OH were verified as the reactive oxidants by EPR test and the radicals scavenging experiment using MeOH and TBA. SO4 center dot- played a dominant role for CBZ degradation. The Density functional theory (DFT) and LC-qTOF-MS/MS clarified that hydroxylation, ketonation, ring opening reaction, and ring contraction were main transformation patterns of CBZ. As to influence factors, CBZ degradation was significantly hindered in presence of CO32-, HPO42- and NOM. Toxicological analysis derived from metabonomics suggested that the remarkable alteration of metabolic profile was triggered by exposure to intermediates mixture. CBZ intermediates interfered in several key metabolic pathways, including pentose phosphate, amino acids, lysine degradation, glycerophospholipid, glutathione, nucleotides and carbohydrate, which was alleviated after UV/bisulfite treatment.

Research on microplastics was first conducted in oceans, and in recent years, inland water, especially lakes, has gradually become a hot spot. This paper systematically reviews the sampling, separation, purification, and identification technologies used to assess microplastics in lakes and summarizes the occurrence of lake microplastics worldwide. The results show that microplastics are widespread in lake water and sediment. There are obvious geographical differences in the occurrence of microplastics. The abundance of microplastics in different lakes varies greatly. The forms are mostly fibrous and fragments, and the main polymers are polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). Previous papers have failed to comment in as much detail on the microplastic sampling techniques employed within lake systems. The sampling and analysis methods are critical to accurately evaluating contamination results. Due to the widespread presence of microplastics and the lack of uniform standards, there are various sampling methods. Trawls and grabs are most widely used in the sampling of lake water bodies and sediment, and sodium chloride and hydrogen peroxide are the most widely used media for flotation and digestion, respectively.

There is a dose-dependent relationship between antimicrobial use (AMU) and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. As most AMU in Canada is related to animal agriculture, there is a need to reduce overall AMU, which could be accomplished through surveillance of AMU in animal agriculture, including the dairy industry. The objective of this study was to quantify AMU on dairy farms across Canada. This study had two parts: a description of data collected in 2019-2020, and a meta-analysis comparing this data to previous estimates of AMU in the Canadian dairy industry. The first included a garbage can audit (GCA) on 107 farms in four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Nova Scotia) in 2020; AMU data were converted to the dose-based metrics of defined course doses (DCD) and defined daily doses (DDD). Mixed-effect linear models were fit to determine the relationship between province and use of different classes of antimicrobials. On average, for every 100 animals on the farm, 117 DCD of antimicrobials were administered per year (IQR: 55, 158). These treatments amounted to 623 DDD / 100 animal-yr (IQR: 302, 677 DDD/100 animal-years). Penicillins were the most used class of antimicrobials, followed by first-and third-generation cephalosporins. Farms in Ontario used more third-generation cephalosporins than other provinces. The second part of this study compared AMU in 2020 to previously reported Canadian studies through a meta-analysis. A GCA was conducted in 2007-2008 in Alberta, Ontario, Quebec, and the Maritime provinces (Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia); another GCA was conducted in Quebec in 2018.

Current studies mainly focused on the individual effects of microplastics or antibiotics on methane generation. However, there may also be complex reactions between them and their combine effects on anaerobic digestion remain unclear. This study revealed the combined influencing mechanism of polyamide and ofloxacin through batch and semi-continuous tests. Brief exposure to ofloxacin was detrimental to methane production. The coexistence of polyamide enabled partial adsorption of ofloxacin, which effectively mitigates the inhibitory effect of ofloxacin at low concentrations. Polyamide also facilitated the colonization of hydrolytic bacteria and acidogens, such as Hydrogenispora, and promoted the conversion of organic matter to acetate. However, polyamide could not effectively alleviate the inhibitory effect of excess ofloxacin on anaerobic digestion. Ofloxacin at high concentrations stimulated the release of humic acid, reduced methane production by more than 80%, and changed the predominant methanogenesis pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Acidogenesis and methanogenesis pathways were restructured to further explore the effect of ofloxacin on the metabolic potentials of microorganisms. Metagenomic analysis revealed that most of functional genes associated with glycolysis, amino acid metabolism and methanogenesis were down regulated under longterm stress of high concentration of ofloxacin.

Thus, this review aims to analyze the current knowledge on sources, spread, and the fate of emerging micropollutants, antibiotic-resistance genes, and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in microbial communities of greywater and downstream recipients. The fate of antimicrobial resistance and emerging micropollutants from greywater in the environment has not been determined. More studies are needed to identify the mechanism/s involved in the degradation of emerging micropollutants and the presence of transformation pathways in the microbial metagenome. In the review, we aim to describe the link between the persistence of emerging micropollutants and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. We showed that the effect of irrigation with treated wastewater was variable. In addition, we tried to summarize the impact of emerging micropollutants on bacteria and their fate in the soil microbiome, demonstrating that emerging micropollutants induce changes in the diversity of soil bacteria.

This work comprehensively revealed the hormesis effects of PHMG occurred in waste activated sludge (WAS) on the generation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during anaerobic fermentation. The low level of PHMG (100 mg/g TSS) significantly promoted the VFAs generation (1283 mg COD/L, compared with 337 mg COD/L in the control) via synchronously facilitating the solubilization, hydrolysis, and acidification steps but inhibiting methanogenesis. Metagenomic analysis showed that the functional anaerobe ( i.e., Bacteroides, Macellibacteroide and Parabacteroide) and corresponding genetic expressions responsible for extracellular hydrolysis (i.e., clpP), membrane transport (i.e., ffh and gspF), intracellular substrates metabolism (i.e., ald and paaF) and VFAs biosynthesis (i.e., ACACA and FASN) were enhanced in the optimal presence of PHMG. Moreover, the anaerobic species could respond and adapt to low PHMG stimuli via quorum sensing (i.e., cqsA, rpfC and rpfG), and thus maintain the high microbial metabolic activities. However, they were unable to tolerate the toxicity of excessive PHMG, resulting in the extremely low VFAs production.

Biodegradation represents a potentially crucial pathway to dissipate TC contamination. However, few efficient TC-degrading bacteria have been isolated and a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TC degradation is still lacking. In this study, a novel TC-degrading bacterium, designated as Sphingobacterium sp. WM1, was successfully isolated from activated sludge. Strain WM1 exhibited a remarkable performance in degrading 50 mg/L TC within 1 day under co-metabolic conditions. Genomic analysis of the strain WM1 unveiled the presence of three functional tetX genes. Unraveling the complex molecular mechanisms, transcriptome analysis highlighted the role of upregulated transmembrane transport and acceler-ated electron transport in facilitating TC degradation. Proteomics confirmed the up-regulation of proteins involved in cellular biosynthesis/metabolism and ribosomal processes. Crucially, the tetX gene-encoding protein showed a significant upregulation, indicating its role in TC degradation. Heterologous expression of the tetX gene resulted in TC dissipation from an initial 51.9 mg/L to 4.2 mg/L within 24 h. The degradation pathway encompassed TC hydroxylation, transforming into TP461 and subsequent metabolites, which effectively depleted TC's inhibitory activity.

This substance has already been detected in rivers, air, soil, plants and even in different human biological samples, such as plasma, umbilical cord blood and breast milk, revealing a great concern to human populations. Thus, in the current study we investigated whether prior exposure of murine melanoma B16-F1 cells to BDE-209 modulates in vivo progression and malignancy of melanoma. B16-F1 cells were cultured and exposed in vitro to BDE-209 (0.01, 0.1 e 1 nM) for 15 days and then inoculated, via caudal vein, in C57BL/6 mice for experimental metastasis analysis after 20 days. Inoculation of BDE-209-exposed cells resulted in 82% increase of metastasis colonized area in the lungs of mice, downregulation of tumor suppressors genes, such as Timp3 and Reck, decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of systemic and local inflammatory response. These findings are related to melanoma progression. Additionally, the histopathological analysis revealed greater number of focal points of metastases in the lungs and invasiveness of metastases to the mice brain (89%). The results showed that exposure to BDE-209 may alter the phenotype of B16-F1 cells, worsening their metastatic profile. Current data showed that BDE-209 may interfere with the prognosis of melanoma by modulating cells with less invasiveness capacity to a more aggressive profile.",,,,,"Oliveira Ribeiro, Ciro Alberto de/A-5199-2008; Neto, Francisco Filipak/J-8915-2012","Oliveira Ribeiro, Ciro Alberto de/0000-0002-3168-9272; Neto, Francisco Filipak/0000-0003-2838-2242; Moggio, Erick/0009-0006-3713-6229; de Marchi, Micheli/0000-0002-6337-155X; Biscaia, Stellee Marcela Petris/0000-0002-4110-4354; Zablocki da Luz, Jessica/0000-0002-9379-4625",,,,,,,,,,,,,0278-6915,1873-6351,,,,FEB,2024,184,,,,,,,,114350,10.1016/j.fct.2023.114350,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.fct.2023.114350,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38097007,,,,,WOS:001138027500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Among the known cardiometabolic risk factors are compounds that induce endocrine and metabolic dysfunctions, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). To date, how EDCs influence molecular programs and cardiometabolic risks has yet to be fully elucidated, especially considering the complexity contributed by species-, chemical-, and dose-specific effects. Moreover, different experimental and analytical methodologies employed by different studies pose challenges when comparing findings across studies. To explore the molecular mechanisms of EDCs in a systematic manner, we established a data-driven computational approach to meta-analyze 30 human, mouse, and rat liver transcriptomic datasets for 4 EDCs, namely bisphenol A (BPA), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), tributyltin (TBT), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Our computational pipeline uniformly re-analyzed preprocessed quality-controlled microarray data and raw RNAseq data, derived differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological pathways, modeled gene regulatory networks and regulators, and determined CMD associations based on gene overlap analysis. Our approach revealed that DEHP and PFOA shared stable transcriptomic signatures that are enriched for genes associated with CMDs, suggesting similar mechanisms of action such as perturbations of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR gamma) signaling and liver gene network regulators VNN1 and ACOT2. In contrast, TBT exhibited highly divergent gene signatures, pathways, network regulators, and disease associations from the other EDCs. In addition, we found that the rat, mouse, and human BPA studies showed highly variable transcriptomic patterns, providing molecular support for the variability in BPA responses. Our work offers insights into the commonality and differences in the molecular mechanisms of various EDCs and establishes a streamlined data-driven workflow to compare molecular mechanisms of environmental substances to elucidate the underlying connections between chemical exposure and disease risks.",,,,,,"Zamora, Zacary/0000-0002-9166-4106",,,,,,,,,,,,,0160-4120,1873-6750,,,,JAN,2024,183,,,,,,,,108339,10.1016/j.envint.2023.108339,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2023.108339,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38043319,,,,,WOS:001133067400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This review systematically summarises the factors affecting biofilm degradation of microplastics and proposes feasible methods to improve the efficiency of microplastic biofilm degradation. Environmentally insensitive microorganisms were screened, optimized, and commercially cultured to facilitate the practical application of this technology. For strain screening, technology should focus on microorganisms/strains that can modify the hydrophobicity of microplastics, degrade the crystalline zone of microplastics, and metabolise additives in microplastics. The biodegradation mechanism is also described; microorganisms secreting extracellular oxidases and hydrolases are key factors for degradation. Measuring the changes in molecular weight distribution (MWD) enables better analysis of the biodegradation behaviour of microplastics.

However, the dynamic root uptake and fate of emerging pollutants in plants, along with their effects on plant characteristics, have received limited research attention. This study explores the potential of Chrysopogon zizanioides (Vetiver) and Colocasia esculenta (Taro) in mitigating pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs)- metronidazole (MNZ), naproxen (NAP), and methylparaben (MeP), under hydroponic conditions. Both plants demonstrated similar specific uptake potentials for the target pollutants (5.23 to 5.76 mg/g of biomass dry weight), with pollutant accumulation in plants remaining very low (<10 %). Notably, a substantial fraction of pollutants (66.27 % to 78.42 %) underwent metabolism. Qualitative analysis identified five MNZ and NAP metabolites and six MeP metabolites in plant tissues. Over a 28-day PPCPs exposure, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulted in reduced chlorophyll content, root activity, protein, and carbohydrates, alongside increased oxidative stress levels. The study highlighted distinct accumulation patterns, with NAP (anion) primarily in roots and MeP (cation) and MNZ (neutral) predominantly in aerial parts. Phloroglucinol staining confirmed the intact endodermis (Casparian Strips) in Vetiver roots, indicating symplastic transport of PPCPs to aerial parts. Moreover, significant morphological alterations were observed in plant roots exposed to target pollutants. During recuperation, a decrease in accumulated ROS indicates partial self-recovery from oxidative damage. In conclusion, both Vetiver and Taro emerge as promising candidates for removing specified PPCPs, emphasizing the critical role of addressing emerging contaminants for sustainable development and preserving the environment and human wellbeing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1385-8947,1873-3212,,,,MAR 1,2024,483,,,,,,,,149180,10.1016/j.cej.2024.149180,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cej.2024.149180,,FEB 2024,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001178844300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This study proposed corroborating this trend, analyzing the available literature on the subject to verify how experts in the AOP area investigated this integration during 2015-2023. For this purpose, a sample of publications was treated by applying the Systematic Review (SR) methodology. This resulted in an extract of 83 studies that adopted life-cycle logic to estimate environmental impacts and process costs or evaluated them as complementary to the technical dimension of each treatment technology. This analysis found that both dimensions can be used for selecting or sizing AOPs at the design scale. However, the appropriate choice of the impact categories for the environmental assessment and establishing a methodology for cost analysis can make the approach still more effective. In addition, a staggering number of processes would broaden the reality and applicability of the estimates, and adopting multicriteria analysis methodologies could address essential aspects of decision-making processes during the design of the arrangements.

Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) are threatened by microplastics. Although substantial studies have explored the dynamics and threats of microplastics in BCEs, the fate and driving factors of microplastics in BCEs on a global scale remain largely unknown. Here, the occurrence, driving factors, and risks of microplastics in global BCEs were investigated by synthesizing a global metaanalysis. The results showed that the abundance of microplastics in BCEs has notable spatial differences worldwide, with the highest microplastic concentrations in Asia, especially in South and Southeast Asia. Microplastic abundance is influenced by the vegetation habitat, climate, coastal environment, and river runoff. The interaction of geographic location, ecosystem type, coastal environment, and climate enhanced the effects of microplastic distribution. In addition, we found that microplastic accumulation in organisms varied according to feeding habits and body weight. Significant accumulation was observed in large fish; however, growth dilution effects were also observed. The effect of microplastics on the organic carbon content of sediments from BCEs varies by ecosystem; microplastic concentrations do not necessarily increase organic carbon sequestration. Global BCEs are at a high risk of microplastic pollution, with high microplastic abundance and toxicity driving the high pollution risk. Finally, this review provides scientific evidence that will form the basis for future microplastic research, focusing on the transport of microplastics in BCEs; effects on the growth, development, and primary productivity of blue carbon plants; and soil biogeochemical cycles.",,,,,"Yang, Xiaofan/L-6472-2015; Chen, Tao/ISU-2767-2023; Li, Xue/HPE-4649-2023","Li, Xueying/0000-0002-8566-5428",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,JUN 20,2023,878,,,,,,,,163048,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163048,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163048,,APR 2023,,,,,,36990230,,,,,WOS:000974397200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In contrast, the impacts of nonantibiotic drugs have been largely overlooked, and their regulation mechanism in anammox system remains unclear. In this study, the single and combined effects of typical antibiotic (doxycycline) and non-antibiotic drug (propranolol) on anammox consortia were evaluated and compared from process performance, community succession, metabolic and gene regulation perspectives. Significant reduction in the nitrogen removal efficiency (49.0 +/- 0.5%) was only observed in the anammox process stressed by propranolol and doxycycline, but it was reversible. Metabolome results showed that anammox consortia upregulated amino acid metabolism under propranolol stress, while the abundance of pyrimidine and purine metabolic pathways significantly increased under doxycycline and multidrug stress. Microorganisms adapted to these stresses by changing the utilization preference for metabolites. Metagenomic analyses indicated that doxycycline and propranolol induced the high frequency of gene transfer through increasing oxidative stress level, membrane permeability, pili and efflux pumps. Significant correlations between ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), especially intI1, demonstrated the conjugative transfer of ARGs. Furthermore, structural equation models showed that microbial community, bacterial metabolism, MGEs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and corresponding SOS response were key driving factors for ARGs transfer in the anammox systems.

Benzophenone-8 (BP-8) is one of the main metabolites of BP-3 in organisms. Current reports show that BP-8 may be more toxic than BP-3. However, difference of their toxicities on embryonic development has rarely been reported. In this study, zebrafish embryos were chosen as the target organism to explore the developmental toxicities of BP-3 and BP-8. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis was performed to compare their modes of action. Results showed that BP-8 exposures led to higher bioaccumulation and lower hatching rate of zebrafish larvae than BP-3. Both BP-8 and BP-3 exposures caused behavioral abnormalities of zebrafish larvae, but no significant difference was found between them. At the metabolome level, 1 mu g/L BP-3 and 1 mu g/L BP-8 exposures altered neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and FoxO signaling pathway, respectively, which might be involved in the abnormal behaviors in zebrafish larvae. For higher exposure groups (30 and 300 mu g/L), both BP-3 and BP-8 exposures changed metabolism of cofactors and vitamins of zebrafish larvae. Exposure of BP-3 altered the metabolism by pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway, while BP-8 exposure changed riboflavin metabolism and folate biosynthesis.

Frontier molecular orbital (FMO), density of states (DOS), and electronic band structure results demonstrated that transition metaldoped oxTAM causes a significant reduction in the energy band gap (Eg) value of pristine oxTAM, with the highest decrease (30.14 %) in the case of Mn@oxTAM. It was found that transition metal doping onto oxTAM leads to an increase in the adsorption energies (1.20-2.64 eV) and charge density between transition metal and IBU. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed that charge was effectively transferred from the IBU towards the transition metal, which was further analyzed by charge decomposition analysis (CDA). Furthermore, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), interaction region indicator (IRI), electron localization function (ELF), and radial distribution function (RDF) analyses revealed that the IBU is adsorbed on the Sc@oxTAM surface via covalent interactions, while electrostatic with partially covalent interactions are dominated in other IBU/TM@oxTAM complexes.

However, the underlying mechanisms and regulatory targets of cardiomyocyte ferroptosis remains to be understood. This study demonstrated that the up-regulation of ferroptosis associated proteins genes were accompanied with the down-regulation of AMPKa2 phosphorylation in DOX treated mouse heart or neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). AMPKa2 knockout (AMPKa2-/-) significantly exacerbated mouse cardiac dysfunction, increased mortality, promoting ferroptosis associated mitochondrial injuries, enhanced ferroptosis associated proteins and genes expression, and lead to accumulation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mouse serum and hearts respectively. Ferrostatin-1 administration markedly improved cardiac function, decreased mortality, inhibited mitochondrial injuries and ferroptosis associated proteins and genes expression, and depressed accumulation of LDH and MDA in DOX treated AMPKa2- /-mouse. Moreover, Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 AMPKa2 (AAV9-AMPKa2) or AICAR treatment mediated AMPKa2 activation could significantly improve cardiac function and depress ferroptosis in mouse. AMPKa2 activation or silence could also inhibit or promote ferroptosis associated injuries in DOX treated NRCMs respecitively.

Exposure to these pollutants has been shown to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming, activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances, and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods. It is also important to consider more pollutants-both individually and in combination-such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and microplastics, due the increasing relevance of these pollutants of emerging concern. In line with this, cichlid fish species with reduced native distributions are suitable study species to provide information for the conservation of freshwater environments.",,,,,,"Olivares-Rubio, Hugo F./0000-0002-7082-4588; Arce, Elsah/0000-0002-9815-2525",,,,,,,,,,,,,0378-1909,1573-5133,,,,MAY,2023,106,5,,,SI,,1149,1176,,10.1007/s10641-022-01376-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10641-022-01376-9,,DEC 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000894730100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

MPs are found in varying concentrations in RAS, especially in fish tissues, raising concerns about fish health. Heavy metals in RAS, originating from feed, pipe corrosion, and make-up water, accumulate, posing risks to fish and necessitating stringent control measures. Antibiotics persist in RAS water and sediment, contributing to ARGs, posing a threat to both fish and human health. Research gaps persist in the removal of MPs, efficient heavy metals control, and addressing antibiotics and ARGs pollution in RAS.

They are also one of the interfering matrices during the analysis of metal ions and contaminants in water samples. Currently, conventional analytical techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) are used for the detection of NPs, but such techniques require bulky instrumentation and are difficult to be automated for online analysis. In this study, we aim to develop a nanoparticle-imprinted hydrogel (NPIH, NANOGEL) to detect and capture NPs in water samples. The principle of the Nanogel originates from the well-known concept of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Cadmium sulfide/Selenide/Zinc sulfide core/shell quantum dots (QDs) were used as the template NP, creating specific pore cavities in the Nanogel that can selectively bind to certain analytes. Quantification of NPs detected in water samples was then made possible by transducing this selective detection process into an analytical signal using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The Nanogel was shown to demonstrate good repeatability, reproducibility, and stability in terms of its performance. The high selectivity of the Nanogel was determined to be attributed to the size of cavities and their surface characteristics. Ionic interference was present and, heavy metal cations showed an affinity for the NANOGEL synthesized; however, they were demonstrated to be minimized by the selection of porogenic solvents during the synthesis of NANOGEL. We believe that the Nanogel would provide a highly selective and sensitive approach for the detection of NPs in aqueous samples and the removal of NPs from contaminated water resources.

The present study was conducted to assess the toxic effects of heavy metals (Cd, Pb) and antibiotics (TC) on Triticum aestivum (T. aestivum, common wheat) based on studies conducted in the past 22 years. Data pertaining to the growth and development of T. aestivum were extracted and analyzed from 89 publications spanning from 2000 to 2022. Our results showed that Pb, Cd and TC significantly reduced growth and development by 11 %, 9 %, and 5 %, respectively. Additionally, significant accumulation of Cd (42 %) and Pb (17 %) was observed in T. aestivum samples, although there was little change in TC accumulation, which showed limited absorption, accumulation, and translocation of TC in wheat plants. Pb had the greatest impact on the yield of T. aestivum, followed by Cd, while TC had no apparent effect. Furthermore, exposure to Cd, Pb and TC reduced the photosynthetic rate due to chlorophyll reduction, with Cd having the most pronounced effect (58 %), followed by Pb (37 %) and TC (8 %). Cd exposure also significantly enhanced gaseous exchange (37 %) compared to TC and Pb, which reduced gaseous exchange by 4 % and 10 %, respectively.

MPs are emerging pollutants in croplands and water systems with significant ecological risks, particularly over the long term. In the soil systems, MPs polymer type, thinness, shape, and size induces numerous effects on soil aggregates, dissolved organic carbon (C), rapidly oxidized organic C, microbial biomass C, microbial biomass nitrogen (N), microbial immobilization, degradation of organic matter, N cycling, and production of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), thereby posing a significant risk of impairing soil physical and biochemical properties over time. Further, toxic chemicals released from polyethylene mulching (PMs) might indirectly harm plant growth by affecting soil wetting-drying cycles, releasing toxic substances that interact with soil matrix, and suppressing soil microbial activity. In the environment, accumulation of MPs poses a risk to human health by accelerating emissions of GHGs, e.g., methane and carbon dioxide, or directly releasing toxic substances such as phthalic acid esters (PAEs) into the soils. Also, larger sizes MPs can adhere to root surface and block stomata could significantly change the shape of root epidermal cells resulting in arrest plant growth and development by restricting water-nutrient uptake, and gene expression and altering the biodiversity of the soil pollutants. In this review, we systematically analyzed the potential risks of MPs to the soil-plant and human body, their occurrence, abundance, and migration in agroecosystems.

Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, physiological and biochemical characterization, and genome-based average nucleotide identity calculation, RL-GZ01 was identified as Rhodococcus pyridinivorans. Strain RL-GZ01 showed high DEHP degradation in alkaline conditions and good tolerance of salinity and organic solvents. The degradation of DEHP by RL-GZ01 fitted well with a modified Gompertz model (R-2 = 0.9985). Metabolic intermediates of DEHP were identified via UHPLC-MS/MS analysis and the catabolic pathway was proposed thereafter. Genes and gene clusters contributed to the utilization of DEHP were analyzed through genomic analysis. Analysis of KEGG nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated that nitrate and nitrite were further transformed into ammonium which was further used for the biosynthesis of L-glutamine and L-glutamate. Strain RLGZ01 was further identified as a denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism which can accumulate phosphate by generating polyphosphate.

Research has shown that persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and phthalate metabolites, are associated with a higher risk of abnormal blood lipid levels in humans. However, the key molecules involved in dyslipidemia and the mecha-nisms are not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the biomarkers that mediate the relationships between blood lipids and four groups of POPs and revealed their potential mechanisms. Specifically, in 278 male blood samples, blood lipid and POPs levels were measured and metabolites were detected using untargeted metabolomics. Spearman's correlation analysis and binary logistic regression were employed to assess the relationship between POPs and lipid indexes. We observed that PFASs were associated with a higher risk of abnormal total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), while other POPs displayed little association with abnormal lipid indexes. Among all the PFASs, 6:2Cl-PFESA was associated with the fewest metabolites. A metabolome-wide association study combined with a meet-in-the-middle approach was used to identify potential biomarkers that mediate the association between POPs and abnormal blood lipids. The mediation analysis pointed to 105 significant mediators as potential biomarkers mediating the association between PFASs and TC, and 82 significant mediators were potential biomarkers that mediated the association between PFASs and LDL. 24-Hydroxycholesterol, 3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-al, PC(18:0/0:0), PC(22:5/0:0), GPCho (18:1/18:1), LysoPC(22:2(13Z,16Z)), LysoPC(16:0), 9(S)-HODE, 9,10-DHOME, L-glutamate, 4-hydroxybutyric acid, cytosine, PC(14:1(9Z)/18:0), sphinganine, and (S)-beta-aminoisobutyrate were identified as important biomarkers.

No statistical difference was found in their fracture healing time, postoperative Harris scores, and malunion rate. The use of a Traction repositor could reduce the set-up time [SMD, - 2.48; 95% CI (- 4.91, - 0.05); P < 0.00001].ConclusionsCompared with manual traction, the traction table in femoral intramedullary nailing surgery lengthened operative time and preoperative set-up time. At the same time, it did not show significant advantages in reducing blood loss volume and fluoroscopy time, or improving prognosis. In clinical practice, the optimal surgical plan must be made on a case-by-case basis to avoid unnecessary traction table use.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1749-799X,,,,,APR 5,2023,18,1,,,,,,,277,10.1186/s13018-023-03659-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13018-023-03659-y,,,,,,,,37020232,,,,,WOS:000963722600003,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this experiment, a whole-body exposure system was used to simulate the real atmospheric environment, and three exposure concentrations combined with the actual environmental concentration were selected to explore the effects of airborne NPs on metabolic diseases. Based on histological analyses, metabolic studies, gene expression, metabolites, and molecular signaling analyses, mice exposed to airborne NPs were observed to show a phenotype of systemic inflammation and complete insulin resistance featuring excessive drinking and eating, weight loss, elevated blood glucose, and decreased triglyceride levels. After airborne NPs exposure, mice were intolerant to glucose and tolerant to insulin. In addition, airborne NPs exposure could result in long-term irreversible hyperglycemia.

Identifying and validating these exposures are of paramount importance to modify disease risk. We previously reported that persistent organic pollutants (POPs) associate with ALS risk and survival and aimed to replicate these findings in a new cohort.Method Participants with and without ALS recruited in Michigan provided plasma samples for POPs analysis by isotope dilution with triple quadrupole mass spectrometry. ORs for risk models and hazard ratios for survival models were calculated for individual POPs. POP mixtures were represented by environmental risk scores (ERS), a summation of total exposures, to evaluate the association with risk (ERSrisk) and survival (ERSsurvival).Results Samples from 164 ALS and 105 control participants were analysed. Several individual POPs significantly associated with ALS, including 8 of 22 polychlorinated biphenyls and 7 of 10 organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). ALS risk was most strongly represented by the mixture effects of OCPs alpha-hexachlorocyclohexane, hexachlorobenzene, trans-nonachlor and cis-nonachlor and an interquartile increase in ERSrisk enhanced ALS risk 2.58 times (p<0.001).

Among PhACs, the anti-inflammatory ibuprofen (IBU) and the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) are two of the most used compounds whose presence has been reported in different aquatic environments worldwide. However, there is still scarce information about the cellular and molecular alterations provoked by IBU and OTC on aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms as microalgae, even more if we refer to their potential combined toxicity. To test the cyto- and genotoxicity provoked by IBU, OTC and their binary combination on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a flow cytometric panel was performed after 24 h of single and co-exposure to both contaminants. Assayed parameters were cell vitality, metabolic activity, intracellular ROS levels, and other programmed cell death (PCD)-related biomarkers as cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potentials and caspase-like and endonuclease activities. In addition, a nuclear DNA fragmentation analysis by comet assay was carried out. For most of the parameters analysed (vitality, metabolic activity, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potentials, and DNA fragmentation) the most severe damages were observed in the cultures exposed to the binary mixture (IBU+OTC), showing a joint cyto- and genotoxicity effect. Both PhACs and their mixture caused a remarkable decrease in cell proliferation and metabolic activity and markedly increased intracellular ROS levels, parallel to a noticeable depolarization of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, a strong increase in both caspase and endonuclease activities as well as a PCD-related loss of nuclear DNA integrity was observed in all treatments. Results analysis showed that the PhACs caused cell death on this non-target organism, involving mitochondrial membrane depolarization, enhanced ROS production and activation of PCD process. Thus, PCD should be an applicable toxicological target for unraveling the harmful effects of co-exposure to PhACs in aquatic organisms as microalgae.",,,,,"Seoane, Marta/HNS-3254-2023; Seoane, Marta/H-3974-2016; Esperanza, Marta/F-8657-2016","Seoane, Marta/0000-0001-5752-5041; Esperanza, Marta/0000-0003-3974-5344",,,,,,,,,,,,,0166-445X,1879-1514,,,,APR,2023,257,,,,,,,,106455,10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106455,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aquatox.2023.106455,,FEB 2023,,,,,,36841069,,,,,WOS:000993850100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Micro/nanoplastics can adhere to terrestrial plant surfaces, be absorbed and transported by plants, and accumulate in the edible parts of plants, leading to the possibility of enrichment and transmission through the food chain and threatening human health. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. With increased studies on the internalization of micro/nanoplastics in terrestrial plants, a comprehensive and systematic review summarizing the current research trends and progress is warranted to provide a reference for further relevant research. Based on bibliometric analysis, this study focused on the mechanisms, study methods, and reduction techniques of micro/nanoplastics adherence, uptake, and translocation by terrestrial plants. The results showed that micro/nanoplastics can adhere to the surfaces of plant tissues such as seeds, roots, and leaves. Root uptake (root-to-leaf translocation) and foliar uptake (leaf-to -root translocation) are the two simultaneous internalization pathways of MNPs in plants. The observation methods included scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), pyrolysis -gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).

Without this knowledge, health-based consumption advisories can not be determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations, Asian and Pacific Islander community members, and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo[a]pyrene [BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered.

Food contamination with pesticide residues (PRs) is a serious concern, especially in developing countries. Several research reports revealed that some Brazilian farmers spray pesticides on fruits and vegetables in large quantities, generating PRs after harvest. Thus, ingestion of food contaminated with PRs can cause adverse health effects. Based on information obtained through a systematic review of essential information from 33 articles, we studied the assessment of potential health risks associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in children and adults from Brazilian states. This study identified 111 PRs belonging to different chemical groups, mainly organophosphates and organochlorines, in 26 fruit and vegetable samples consumed and exported by Brazil. Sixteen of these PRs were above the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) established by local and international legislation. We did not identify severe acute and chronic dietary risks, but the highest risk values were observed in Sa tilde o Paulo and Santa Catarina, associated with the consumption of tomatoes and sweet peppers due to the high concentrations of organophosphates. A high long-term health risk is associated with the consumption of oranges in Sa tilde o Paulo and grapes in Bahia due to chlorothalonil and procymidone. We also identified that 26 PRs are considered carcinogenic by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), and the carcinogenic risk analysis revealed no severe risk in any Brazilian state investigated due to the cumulative hazard index (HI) < 1. However, the highest HI values were in Sa tilde o Paulo due to acephate and carbaryl in sweet pepper and in Bahia due to dichlorvos. This information can help regulatory authorities define new guidelines for pesticide residue limits in fruits and vegetables commonly consumed and exported from Brazil and monitor the quality of com-mercial formulations.",,,,,"de Andrade, Jelmir Craveiro/IXX-0498-2023; Conte-Junior, Carlos Adam/J-5815-2014; Galvan, Diego/AAS-4855-2020","de Andrade, Jelmir Craveiro/0000-0002-4886-302X; Conte-Junior, Carlos Adam/0000-0001-6133-5080; Galvan, Diego/0000-0001-8394-3431",,,,,,,,,,,,,0045-6535,1879-1298,,,,MAY,2023,322,,,,,,,,138244,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138244,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138244,,FEB 2023,,,,,,36841459,,,,,WOS:000949881700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

VL is transmitted by different species of sandflies and key strategies against VL rely on the control of the vectors. This systematic review assesses the efficacy and community effectiveness of indoor residual spraying (IRS) in controlling sandflies and VL occurrence among humans. After a revision of 8822 initial hits, 21 studies were included in this systematic review.Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts by up to 95% for at least one month. DDT has been used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over time. Combinations of different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as key issues for control programmes. No human transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS on human transmission,-although by modelling studies an effect of IRS on human transmission can be demonstrated. Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is one of the interventions to control the vectors of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Different insecticides are used in affected countries, also in the Regional Initiative for the Elimination of VL in South-East Asia. This systematic review assesses all available studies analysing the effectiveness of IRS on the key vectors of VL. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, with a broad search strategy, applied to seven key databases. Inclusion criteria were studies focusing on 1) Visceral leishmaniasis 2) Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) or synonyms, and 3) all primary research methods. 21 studies were included, five cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), one randomised controlled trial (RCT), 11 intervention studies, also included were three modelling studies and one survey. 19 out of 21 included studies were published between 2009 and 2020. 18 of the studies were conducted in the context of the Regional Initiative. Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, confirmed in terms of effectiveness and by the availability of studies. Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts, and/or Phlebotomus argentipes counts by up to 95% with an effect of a minimum of one month. Prolonged effects are not regularly seen. DDT has been used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over time. Two intervention studies, embedded in larger programmes in 2019 and 2020, replaced DDT with alpha-Cypermethrin throughout the study. Combinations of different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as key issues for programmes. No human transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS-although modelling studies confirm the effect of IRS on human transmission. Concluding, IRS continues to be an effective intervention for Phlebotomus argentipes control. Delivery requires constant monitoring and quality assurance. Further studies need to assess IRS in different geographical areas affected by VL and combinations of interventions.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1935-2735,,,,,MAY,2022,16,5,,,,,,,,10.1371/journal.pntd.0010391,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pntd.0010391,,,,,,,,35587498,,,,,WOS:000944355200014,View Full Record in Web of Science

Industrial park wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treat large amounts of comprehensive wastewater derived from industrial production and park human activity, which is possible a source of ARGs and pathogens. Therefore, this study investigated the occurrence and prevalence of ARGs, ARGs hosts and pathogens and assesses the ARGs health risk in the biological treatment process in a large-sale industrial park WWTP using metagenomic analysis and omics-based framework, respectively. Results show that the major ARG subtypes are multidrug resistance genes (MDRGs), macB, tetA(58), evgS, novA, msbA and bcrA and the ARGs main hosts were genus Acidovorax, Pseudomonas, Mesorhizobium. In particular, all determined ARGs genus level hosts are pathogens. The total removal percentage of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens were 12.77 %, 12.96% and 25.71% respectively, suggesting that the present treatment could not efficiently remove these pollutants. The relative abundance of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens varied along biological treatment process that ARGs and MDRGs were enriched in activated sludge and pathogens were enriched in both secondary sedimentation tank and activated sludge. Among 980 known ARGs, 23 ARGs (e.g., ermB, gadX and tetM) were assigned into risk Rank I with characters of enrichment in the human-associated environment, gene mobility and pathogenicity. The results indicate that industrial park WWTPs might serve as an important source of ARGs, MDRGs, and pathogens.

In addition, function (e.g., CAZy, eggNOG and KEGG) is also an important biotic factor; however, how function correlates to ARGs and thus contributes to the antibiotic resistome remains ambiguous. This work explores the effect of sulfonamides (SAs) on ARGs and MGEs by a metagenomic analysis, a principal component analysis (PCA), and a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS). Then, the work establishes a correlation between ARGs and function with a co-occurrence network and reveals the contribution and positive (negative)/direct (indirect) effect of taxonomy, MGEs, and function to the antibiotic resistome by variation partitioning analysis (VPA) and partial least-squares-path modeling (PLS-PM). The results show that the soil has diverse ARGs and several MGEs and SAs impose significant effects on them. Further, CAZy, eggNOG, and KEGG (including pathway and orthology) show strong and significant correlation with ARGs on the basis of the co-occurrence network; however, in our system it seems that only the KEGG pathway promotes the interpretation of ARGs and should be regarded as the priority function on considering the role of function in structuring the antibiotic resistome.

Male factors are estimated to be responsible for up to 40-50% of these cases. While the cause of these reproductive disorders is still unclear, the exposure to a family of ubiquitous compounds in our daily life, named endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) could be involved. This paper was aimed at performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of population studies exploring whether human male exposure to EDCs affects male fertility. Clinical and observational studies assessing the exposure to EDCs along with sperm quality, the most common reproductive disorders, sperm DNA damage, sperm oxidative stress, fertilization rate, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate were included. The quality assessment tool from the NHLBI-NIH was used to assure that studies met standardized quality criteria. Sensitivity analysis and heterogeneity among studies was assessed. Overall, the 32 selected articles, including 7825 individuals in the systematic review, explored 12 families of EDCs. The results revealed a high heterogeneity among studies in relation to the association between exposure to EDCs and the endpoints analyzed. Meta-analyses were performed with data from 7 articles including 479 individuals, 4 articles assessing the association between BPA in urine and sperm quality, and 3 articles evaluating PCB153 in serum and sperm quality. In the meta-analysis, we identified an unpredicted significant positive association between PCB153 exposure and sperm concentration. However, it would not be clinically relevant. No positive or inverse associations were found neither for BPA, nor for PCB153 and the rest of sperm parameters analyzed.

Derrick; Limbeck, Andreas",,,Capabilities of simultaneous 193 nm - LIBS/LA-ICP-MS imaging for microplastics characterization,TALANTA,,,,,,,,,,,,"Microplastics (MPs) are currently one of the major environmental challenges within our society. With the awareness of the impact of MPs on the environment increasing over the last years, the need for increased monitoring as well as comprehensive analysis to better understand the fate and impact of MPs has become more and more important. A major aspect of MP characterization is the assignment of the polymer type of individual particles. Here, per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), originating from fluor-containing polymers, have gained a lot of attention due to the severe environmental impact. Additionally, quantitative analysis of the metal content is of great interest in the field, since MPs are prone to either leaching (in)organic additives into the environment or taking up and accumulating hazardous components (e.g., heavy metals). In this work we demonstrate the capabilities of a simultaneous LIBS/LA-ICP-MS setup for the analysis of MPs. In the first part, we demonstrate the potential of targeted LIBS analysis for the imaging of fluor-containing polymers. Using a laser spot size of 5 mu m combined with highly sensitive ICCD detection enables analysis of particles in the low mu m range. In the second part we combine the polymer-identification capabilities of LIBS with the high sensitivity of ICP-MS to perform matrix-matched quantification of the metal content of individual MPs. In this case we use a spot size of 50 mu m facilitating polymer classification with a broadband spectrometer, resulting in detection limits of 0.72 mu g/g for Pb and 9.5 mu g/g for Sn simultaneously measured using ICP-MS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0039-9140,1873-3573,,,,MAR 1,2024,269,,,,,,,,125500,10.1016/j.talanta.2023.125500,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.talanta.2023.125500,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38070285,,,,,WOS:001140002300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

While earlier research indicated a potential connection between phthalate exposure and blood pressure (BP) during pregnancy, the results of these studies remain inconclusive. The objective of this meta-analysis was to elucidate the relationship between phthalate exposure and BP in pregnancy. A comprehensive literature search was carried out with PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, and pertinent studies published up until 5 March 2023 were reviewed. Random-effects models were utilized to consolidate the findings of continuous outcomes, such as diastolic and systolic BP, as well as the binary outcomes of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP). The present study included a total of 10 studies. First-trimester MBP exposure exhibited a positive association with mean systolic and diastolic BP during both the second and third trimesters (beta = 1.05, 95% CI: 0.27, 1.83, I-2 = 93%; beta = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.05, 0.74, I-2 = 71%, respectively). Second-trimester monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP) exposure was positively associated with systolic and diastolic BP in the third trimester (beta = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.01, 1.13, I-2 = 0; beta = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.27, 1.13, I-2 = 0, respectively). Conversely, first-trimester mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (MEHP) exposure demonstrated a negative association with mean systolic and diastolic BP during the second and third trimesters (beta = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.60, -0.05, I-2 = 0; beta = -0.32, 95% CI: -0.60, -0.05, I-2 = 0, respectively). Additionally, monoethyl phthalate (MEP) exposure was found to be associated with an increased risk of HDP (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.23, I-2 = 26%). Our study found that several phthalate metabolites were associated with increased systolic and diastolic BP, as well as the risk of HDP across pregnancies. Nevertheless, given the limited number of studies analyzed, additional research is essential to corroborate these findings and elucidate the molecular mechanisms linking phthalates to BP changes during pregnancy.",,,,,"zhang, xinyu/JKI-8403-2023; zhao, lin/JJF-0406-2023; li, wenjing/JMP-7498-2023; YI, J/JJE-7713-2023; Wang, Jin/KAM-5595-2024; liu, xingyu/JXW-9444-2024; zheng, yan/JKJ-3632-2023; Liu, Joyce/KEI-8953-2024; Zhang, Yusi/JNS-2335-2023; wang, jiaqi/JSL-7112-2023; Guo, Lin/KFS-9366-2024; Zhang, Wenxiao/KCK-3295-2024; zhang, can/KHC-5357-2024; chen, chen/JGD-3057-2023; Lin, Xiaoqi/KFS-5750-2024; LIU, LIYING/KAM-4121-2024","Hu, Cheng-Yang/0000-0002-0052-9030",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2218-1989,,,,JUL,2023,13,7,,,,,,,812,10.3390/metabo13070812,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/metabo13070812,,,,,,,,37512519,,,,,WOS:001036309700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The Workshop arose from a previous workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on 'Late Lessons from Early Warnings' (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those agents. Results: Workshop participants used recent case studies including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency - Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations, which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public's health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence of financial conflicts of interest. Conclusion: The recommendations should enhance the production of actionable evidence,  that is, reliable evaluations of the scientific evidence to support timely actions to protect health and environments from exposures to hazardous agents.

The purine metabolites such as inosine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were increased in patient serum. TCGA database samples were collected, and the correlation between purine metabolism-related genes and ICC clinical features was analyzed using R language to obtain the differential genes including PPAT, PFAS, ATIC, and IMPDH2. High PPAT expression was associated with poor ICC prognosis. A PPAT silencing model in HCCC-9810 cells was constructed. The cell phenotype was examined by qRT-PCR, CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry, showing a decrease in IMPDH1 expression, colony and invasive cells numbers, and an increase in apoptosis. Guanosine reversed IMPDH1 expression in HCCC-9810 cells, promoting the secretion of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-8, OPN, VEGF, and VCAM-1 and intensifying epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression in the cells. In nude mice, the IMPDH1 inhibitory drug MMF inhibited tumor growth and reduced the expression of tumor stem cell characteristic markers CD133 and SOX2.

The healthy FT provides the biological environment for successful fertilization and facilitates the subsequent movement of the conceptus to the endometrial cavity. However, when the FT is damaged, as with salpingitis, pyosalpinx, and hydrosalpinx, it may increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition. Decidualization refers to a multifactorial process by which the endometrium changes to permit blastocyst implantation. The decidualization reaction is vital for endometrial receptivity during the window of implantation. To date, no comprehensive review that collates evidence on decidualization in the human FT has been conducted. Therefore, the aim of this review is to compile the current evidence on cellular decidualization occurring in the healthy and pathological FT in women of reproductive age. A literature search was conducted using five databases and identified 746 articles, 24 of which were analyzed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The available evidence indicates that the FT are able to undergo decidual changes under specific circumstances; however, the exact mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which decidualization can occur in the FT.

Background Treatment failure is considered to be an important factor in relation to the increase in scabies incidence over the last decade. However, the regional and temporal differences, in addition to the predictors of therapy failure, are unclear.Objectives We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the prevalence of treatment failure in patients with scabies and investigation of associated factors.Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 2021 for randomized and quasi-randomized trials, in addition to observational studies that enrolled children or adults diagnosed with confirmed or clinical scabies treated with permethrin, ivermectin, crotamiton, benzyl benzoate, malathion, sulfur or lindane, and measured treatment failure or factors associated with treatment failure. We performed a random effects meta-analysis for all outcomes reported by at least two studies.Results A total of 147 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. The overall prevalence of treatment failure was 15.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-17.6; I2 = 95.3%, moderate-certainty evidence] with regional differences between World Health Organization regions (P = 0.003) being highest in the Western Pacific region (26.9%, 95% CI 14.5-41.2).

The aim of this systematic review is to assess contaminants present in DHM samples that preterm and critically ill infants consume. The data sources used include PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science. A search of the data sources targeting DHM and its potential contaminants yielded 426 publications. Two reviewers (S. T. and D. L.) conducted title/abstract screening through Covidence software, and predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded 26 manuscripts. Contaminant types (bacterial, chemical, fungal, viral) and study details (e.g., type of bacteria identified, study setting) were extracted from each included study during full-text review. Primary contaminants in donor human milk included bacterial species and environmental pollutants. We found that bacterial contaminants were identified in 100% of the papers in which bacterial contamination was sought (16 papers) and 61.5% of the full data set (26 papers), with the most frequently identified genera being Staphylococcus (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) and Bacillus (e.g., Bacillus cereus). Chemical pollutants were discovered in 100% of the papers in which chemical contamination was sought (eight papers) and 30.8% of the full data set (26 papers). The most frequently identified chemical pollutants included perfluoroalkyl substances (six papers), toxic metal (one paper) and caffeine (one paper).

J,"Li, DY; Sun, CX; Liu, X; Dai, YH; Zhao, J",,,,"Li, Diying; Sun, Chunxiao; Liu, Xia; Dai, Yanhui; Zhao, Jian",,,Interaction between per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and microorganisms,CHINESE SCIENCE BULLETIN-CHINESE,,,,,,,,,,,,"Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are fluorinated substances that contain at least one completely fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon atom (without any H/Cl/Br/I connected to the carbon atom). Because of the excellent thermal stability, high surface activity, lipophobicity and hydrophobicity, they are widely used in different fields such as non-stick coatings, dental floss, and aqueous film-forming foams. PFASs inevitably enter the environments by industrial and domestic emissions, and exist stably in the environment. In recent years, PFASs pollution becomes a global environmental problem. Microorganisms are an indispensable part of the ecosystems, acting as an important participant in the material cycle and energy flow. Both microbial surfaces and PFASs are relatively hydrophobic, and hydrophobic interaction facilitates PFASs to contact microorganisms, which further inhibit their activity. In turn, microorganisms could affect the transformation and fate of PFASs. Therefore, it is of importance to systematically summarize the interaction between PFASs and microorganisms in order to provide critical information for better understanding the environmental risks of PFASs. This review systematically expounded the interaction between PFASs and environmental microorganisms. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of PFASs to bacteria was highlighted. It was found that PFASs could promote the synthesis and release of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and affect the composition and structure of EPS, thereby inhibiting the activity of extracellular enzymes or destroying the integrity of biofilm. In addition, hydrophobic interaction promoted the penetration of PFASs to the phospholipid bilayer, increasing the fluidity and permeability of the membrane. Furthermore, the increase of membrane permeability caused bacterial metabolism disorder, which resulted in the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS could oxidize unsaturated fatty acids to malondialdehyde (MDA), and induce crosslinking of nucleic acids and lead to DNA damage. Secondly, this review elucidated the impact of PFASs on the microbial communities in the environments. In the soil and freshwater environments, the changes of bacterial abundance are mainly regulated by PFASs concentrations. It is worth noting that PFASs at high concentration (>10 mg/kg) reduced the abundance of bacteria related to soil nitrogen transformation and phosphorus metabolism, thus posing a potential threat to the cycling capacities of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. Additionally, sulfur cycle and nitrification process in freshwater environment are inhibited by high-concentration PFASs (>10 mg/L). In terms of the marine environment, the impact of PFASs on microbial communities was much lower than that of environmental parameters (e.g., nutrient substances and salinity). Finally, the microbial transformation pathway of PFASs was discussed. The biofilm formed by microorganisms and their extracellular secretions could adsorb and transform/degrade PFASs by different reactions (e.g., Feammox, desulfurization and hydrolysis), mediating by extracellular enzymes (e.g., C-SO3- bond lyase, phosphatase and polyurethane enzyme), thus affecting the toxicity and fate of PFASs. Moreover, the challenges and future perspectives were addressed. PFASs in the biofilm could be transferred to the organisms at higher trophic level through the parasitic or predatory food chains. Therefore, the risk of PFASs along the microbe-based food chain should be further investigated. In addition, microorganisms existed in the environments usually in the form of community. Current research on the molecular mechanisms of PFASs on microbial quorum sensing is relatively lacking, and deserves an in-depth investigation. Finally, due to the lack of some metabolite standards and instrument detection limit, there are still unidentified transformation products in the biotransformation pathways of PFASs. The issues highlighted above are suggested to be focused on the further investigations.",,,,,"Zhao, Jian/D-2798-2012",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0023-074X,2095-9419,,,,,2023,68,8,,,,,872,885,,10.1360/TB-2022-0948,http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2022-0948,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000956995200004,View Full Record in Web of Science

Studies have reported the toxicity of combined pollutants on the performance and mi-crobial community in sequencing batch reactors. However, the influence of combined pollutants on nitrogen removal in wetlands remains unclear. Here, an 84 d exposure experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of cadmium (Cd) and doxycycline (DC) on nitrogen metabolism in ecological ditches using metagenomic anal-ysis. The results showed that adding 50 mg L-1 DC at 5 mg L-1 Cd stress deteriorated nitrogen removal per-formance and significantly increased N2O emissions and lactate dehydrogenase release. However, a low level of Cd (0.5 mg L-1) significantly reduced N2O emissions under the high DC concentration pressure (50 mg L-1). The increasing Cd concentration markedly weakened the inhibition of DC (1 mg L-1) on the relative abundances of the dominant genera. Moreover, high concentrations of mixed Cd/DC showed stronger inhibitory effects on glucokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase. NADH had a higher tolerance to mixed Cd/DC than ATP. However, low levels of mixed Cd/DC led to a higher abundance of key denitrifying enzymes and genes. The assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway increased under the mixture of Cd/DC stress, accompanied by an increase in ferredoxin-nitrite/nitrate reductase and the abundance of nasA and nirA genes. Our results indicate that the presence of low-level Cd could alleviate the impact of DC on nitrogen removal and N2O emissions in ecological ditches by altering microbial community and enzymatic activity associated with transport, metabolism, and gene expression. However, the increasing Cd concentration at DC stress could intensify the combined toxicity. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the ecological toxicity of emerging combined pollutants and their impact on biological nitrogen transformation in wastewater treatment systems.",,,,,"Liu, Yilin/JWP-9153-2024; Wang, Guang/JFS-8374-2023; Liu, Gui/JHU-8707-2023; Chen, Yuxuan/IWL-8267-2023; Yang, Mei/JNS-2225-2023; Zhang, Lijuan/KAM-0174-2024; zhang, zheng/KBQ-7815-2024; wang, zhenhui/JMQ-0550-2023; xuan, li/JNI-7432-2023; Jia, Li/JVN-3095-2024; Ding, Yang/JUV-4842-2023; XIE, WANYING/JNR-9259-2023","Liu, Yilin/0000-0002-7581-3933; Ma, Lin/0000-0002-9857-5253",,,,,,,,,,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,FEB 10,2023,387,,,,,,,,135807,10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135807,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.135807,,JAN 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000923567300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Pollution from toxic synthetic chemicals, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical substances etc. adversely affect aquatic ecosystem. It also make the polluted water unusable for human contact or consumption. Pollution from heavy metal namely, arsenic, cadmium, nickel, mercury, chromium, zinc, lead etc. is becoming a major health risk. Many diseases like gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders, skin lesions, vascular damage, immune system dysfunction, birth defects, and cancer are associated with heavy metal poisoning. Adsorption-based methods are highly popular and advantageous because of their low cost, high retention time, and good recyclability. Carbon dots are emerging as green adsorbents of recent times for various categories of water contaminants including heavy metals. The use of bio sources as a green precursor to carbon dot synthesis is opening a huge opportunity to fabricate inexpensive materials for heavy metal remediation in the future. With very high surface functionalities and large speific surface area, the adsorption of heavy metals as high as 2000 mg g-1 is achievable. In this review, recent development about the use of carbon dot-composites with materials such as biopolymers, zeolites, layered double hydroxides, spinels and metal-organic frameworks has been discussed. Such matrix enhance the water stability of the carbon dots as well as synergistically improve the kinetics and thermodynamics of the interaction process making it an efficient material for heavy metal remediation. The review discusses the synthesis protocols of fabricating different carbon dot composites. It lists the various advantages of carbon dot-composite over other materials used for heavy metal remediation viz. low-cost as most of them are synthesized from biomass. Hence, they are biogenic, possessing many functional moieties making them efficient and eco-friendly in the removal of heavy metals. In addition, the review lists many advantages associated with green carbon dot based composites like methods of regeneration and reusability.

To provide a comprehensive overview of the association between environmental pollutants and GDM, we per-formed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Several electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline and Cochrane) were searched for related epidemiological and experimental studies up to September 2022. For epidemiological studies, a meta-analysis was carried out to appraise the effect of environmental pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), phenols, phthalates (PAEs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and par-abens exposure on GDM. Moreover, we also summarized possible biological mechanisms linking pollution exposure and GDM based on the included experimental studies. A total of 80 articles were enrolled, including 38 epidemiological studies and 42 experimental studies. Meta-analysis results showed that exposure to PAEs [OR (95%CI) = 1.07 (1.00, 1.14)], PFASs [OR (95%CI) = 1.10 (1.01, 1.19)], as well as PCBs [OR (95%CI) = 1.18 (1.02, 1.36)] and PBDEs [OR (95%CI) = 1.33 (1.17, 1.50)] significantly increased the risk of GDM, but no significant effects were found for phenols, OCPs, and parabens. In addition, experimental studies suggested that the potential biological mechanisms of environmental pollutants contributing to GDM may involve insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, neurohormonal dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetic modification, and alterations in gut microbiome. In conclusion, long-term environmental pollutants exposure may induce the development of GDM, and there may be a synergistic effect between the homologs.

This is compounded by the increasing pollution levels with increasing population and industrialization. Activated carbon remains the most widely used adsorbent for the removal of chemical pollutants in both drinking water and wastewater treatment processes due to its unique chemical properties and a plethora of precursor materials for development. However, to date, no available literature has systematically summarized the advances in Africa on the adsorptive removal of contaminants using activated carbons and research issues such as data acquisition and presentation, analysis approaches, citations, inconsistencies and adsorption experimental setups remain largely undocumented. In this paper, adsorption studies from Africa focusing on activated carbons for the removal of various contaminants are reviewed, from 2007 to 2022. The study focused on a literature-based approach by searching key terms in selected databases. The adsorption data were mostly best described by the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models for dyes, anions, metal ions pesticides, and pharmaceutical compounds. According to the pooled data, the highest adsorption capacity was 1552.5 mg g-1 for PFOS adsorbed onto H3PO4-activated maize tassel-based carbon. The majority of the studies relied on linearized adsorption isotherm and kinetic models with coefficient of determination (R2) as the sole criterion for determining best-fitting models. Additionally, the majority of the studies are batch mode and laboratory-scale studies with no desorption and recyclability evaluations. Researchers should be careful to present accurate equations and units of parameters with proper citations. Pilot -scale and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the reported new materials represent an aspect largely unexplored. The fact that studies from most African countries, dating beyond 2007, could be obtained implies that activated carbons present an accessible and possibly sustainable technology for emerging economies.",,,,,,"SHIKUKU, VICTOR/0000-0002-2295-293X",,,,,,,,,,,,,2666-5239,,,,,DEC,2023,18,,,,,,,,100501,10.1016/j.apsadv.2023.100501,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apsadv.2023.100501,,NOV 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001124298000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The synthesized nanomaterials were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques, such as TEM, FTIR, UV-vis, XRD, and SEM-EDX-mapping to confirm the formation of nanocomposite material. The synthesized materials were explored as photocatalysts for the degradation of xylenol orange (XO) under a visible light source and a comparative study was explored to check the efficiency of the bimetallic co-doped nanocomposite to the pristine metal tungstate NPs. XRD analysis proved that reinforcement of Co2+ in ZnWO4 lattice results in a reduction in interplanar distance from 0.203 nm to 0.185 nm, which is reflected in its crystallite size, which reduced from 32 nm to 24 nm. Contraction in crystallite size reflects on the optical properties as the energy bandgap of ZnWO4 reduced from 3.49 eV to 3.33 eV in Zn0.5Co0.5WO4, which is due to the formation of a Z-scheme for charge transfer and enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency. The experimental results suggested that ZnWO4, CoWO4, and Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 NPs achieved a photocatalytic efficiency of 97.89%, 98.10%, and 98.77% towards XO in 120 min of visible solar light irradiation.

Fractal theory can realize the fractal structure characterization of fault structures and the spatial distribution of mineral deposits, which is helpful for mineral exploration. However, the fault fractal research and prospecting application are still seldom covered in the EGMB. We used fractal theory to determine fine-scale fractal structure characteristics of fault structures and ore deposits in the EGMB, and Fry analysis to delineate favorable metallogenic areas. The results show that within a scale range of 3.670-58.716 km, the integrated faults capacity dimension (CPD) is 1.5095, the information dimension (IND) is 1.5391, and the correlation dimension (CRD) is 1.5436, indicating fault structures with high maturity, which are conducive to the migration and accumulation of ore-forming fluids. The multi-fractal spectrum width and height are 0.3203 and 1.5355, respectively, implying a significant metallogenic potential.

This study explores how DDTs enable value creation in the prevention of SSIs. This study follows a systematic literature review approach and the PRISMA statement to analyse peer-reviewed articles from seven databases. Fifty-nine articles were included in the review and were analysed through a descriptive and a thematic analysis. The findings suggest a growing interest in DDTs in SSI prevention in the last 5 years, and that machine learning and smartphone applications are widely used in SSI prevention. DDTs are mainly applied to prevent SSIs in clean and clean-contaminated surgeries and often used to manage patient-related data in the postoperative stage. DDTs enable the creation of nine categories of value that are classified in four dimensions: cost/sacrifice, functional/instrumental, experiential/hedonic, and symbolic/expressive.

From these chemicals, 14 compounds, namely, 17 beta-estradiol (E2), ethinylestradiol (EE2), tamoxifen (TAM), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), 17 beta-trenbolone (TRB), flutamide (FLU), vinclozolin (VIN), triiodothyronine (T3), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), terephthalic acid (TPA), trifloxystrobin (TRF), ketoconazole (KTC), and prochloraz (PCZ), were selected as references and used for the identification of apical endpoints within the EATS modalities. Among these endpoints, during classification, priorities are given to sex reversal (masculinization of females and feminization of males), gonad histology (testis-ova or ovotestis), secondary sex characteristics (anal fin papillae of males), plasma and liver vitellogenin (VTG) contents in males, swim bladder inflation during larval development, hepatic vitellogenin (vtg) and choriogenin (chg) genes in the liver of males, and several genes, including estrogen-androgen-thyroid receptors in the hypothalamus-pituitary-gonad/thyroid axis (HPG/T). After reviewing 205 articles, we identified 108 (52.68%), 46 (22.43%), 19 (9.26%), 22 (17.18%), and 26 (12.68%) papers that represented studies on estrogen endocrine disruptors (EEDs), androgen endocrine disruptors (AEDs), thyroid endocrine disruptors (TEDs), and/or steroidogenesis modulators (MOS), respectively. Most importantly, among 128 EDCs, 32 (25%), 22 (17.18%), 15 (11.8%), and 14 (10.93%) chemicals were classified as EEDs, AEDs, TEDs, and MOS, respectively. We also identified 43 (33.59%) chemicals as high-priority candidates for tier 2 tests, and 13 chemicals (10.15%) show enough potential to be considered EDCs without any further tier-based studies. Although our literature search was unable to identify the EATS targets of 45 chemicals (35%) studied in 60 (29.26%) of the 205 articles, our approach has sufficient potential to further move the laboratory-based research data on Japanese medaka for applications in regulatory risk assessments in humans.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2673-3080,,,,NOV 27,2023,5,,,,,,,,1272368,10.3389/ftox.2023.1272368,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/ftox.2023.1272368,,,,,,,,38090358,,,,,WOS:001121854500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Recent accidental explosion incidents and the associated damages have demonstrated the importance of hydrogen safety against potential explo-sions. This article presents a systematic review on hydrogen explosions. Potential explo-sion scenarios including the existence of impurities and rich-oxygen environment in the production, storage with extreme-high pressure and ultra-low temperature, trans-portation, and consumption processes are reviewed. Different types of hydrogen-air cloud explosion include expansion and deflagration, detonation, and deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT). Existing studies on hydrogen explosion covering laboratory and field blasting test, numerical simulation utilizing various computational approaches, and theoretical derivation are reviewed and summarized. CFD modeling is currently one of the main research methods because of its cost effectiveness, though challenges existing in simulation hydrogen-air cloud detonation comparing with testing results. Apart from the properties of hydrogen-air cloud such as concentration, size and heterogeneity, environ-mental factors such as ignition, ventilation and obstacle are found to strongly influence the loading characteristics of hydrogen-air cloud explosion. Existing prediction approaches for estimating blast loading from hydrogen-air cloud explosion including the TNT equivalent method (TNT-EM), TNO multi-energy method (TNO MEM), and Baker-Strehlow-Tang method (BST) are primarily empirical based. Because of the inherited difference of hydrogen-air cloud from solid explosives and conventional flammable gases, the accu-racies of these approaches are still doubtable, which requires further study.

Delirium assessment is difficult because it involves the alteration of different mental functions in patients of any age who have serious medical-surgical conditions or dementia. Therefore, concrete assessment tools for specific needs are required. This systematic review synthetizes the information about the tools available in Spanish for delirium clinical assessment. Materials and methods. This is a systematic review that follows the PRISMA Diagnostic Test Accuracy guideline. Using a search algorithm, two researchers assessed five scientific indexing systems and searched for additional papers and grey literature. Other two researchers recorded in a standardized way the data of the papers included. The quality of translations, cultural adaptations, and validations were assessed. Results. We identified 21 reports on translation, cultural adaptation, or validation of 14 tools for 1) detailed evaluation, diagnosis, and quantification of severity by experts, 2) assessment of concrete aspects of delirium, 3) screening in adults, 4) pediatric screening, and 5) diagnosis and weighting of severity by treating staff. 78.6% of translations and all adaptations are of good quality. 52.9% of validations have a low risk of bias, 41.2% have a moderate risk, and only 5.9% have a high risk.

Over 1400 research articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of this test. Methods The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects-mainly from a patient-perspective. Results A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? Conclusions Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1755-8166,,,,AUG 19,2022,15,1,,,,,,,36,10.1186/s13039-022-00612-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13039-022-00612-2,,,,,,,,35986330,,,,,WOS:000842035900002,View Full Record in Web of Science

Moreover, the emerging issue of multi-resistance against traditional antibiotics obligates specialists to turn to new alternative agents. However, cases of Fosfomycin-resistant strains are being detected at a rising rate worldwide, among humans and animals. The objective of this review is to collect, present and analyze studies related to Fosfomycin resistance in isolates from companion animals and specifically dogs and cats. Variable articles were collected and data for the relevant strains were scanned and evaluated. Since Fosfomycin is an agent not routinely used by veterinarians, the detection of Fosfomycin-resistant strains in canine and feline samples indicates possible dissemination of these strains among humans, pets, and the environment, reinforced by other factors. Concerning the origin, the species, and the resistance patterns of the related bacteria, useful conclusions were drawn, about the presence, the spreading, and possibly the causes of Fosfomycin resistance among companion animals and between them and their environment. Fosfomycin is an old antibacterial agent, which is currently used mainly in human medicine, in uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs). The purpose of this review is to investigate the presence and the characteristics of Fosfomycin resistance in bacteria isolated from canine or feline samples, estimate the possible causes of the dissemination of associated strains in pets, and underline the requirements of prospective relevant studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search of current literature in two databases. A total of 33 articles were finally included in the review. Relevant data were tracked down, assembled, and compared. Referring to the geographical distribution, Northeast Asia was the main area of origin of the studies. E. coli was the predominant species detected, followed by other Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococci, and Pseudomonas spp. FosA and fosA3 were the more frequently encountered Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARGs) in the related Gram-negative isolates, while fosB was regularly encountered in Gram-positive ones. The majority of the strains were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and co-carried resistance genes against several classes of antibiotics and especially beta-Lactams, such as bla(CTX-M) and mecA. These results demonstrate the fact that the cause of the spreading of Fosfomycin-resistant bacteria among pets could be the extended use of other antibacterial agents, that promote the prevalence of MDR, epidemic strains among an animal population. Through the circulation of these strains into a community, a public health issue could arise.

The research on atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and water, but AMPs' potential environmental impacts are explored in an even wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m(-2) d(-1) or 0 to 1583 n m(-3). The distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the diversity of AMPs' shape and composition are higher in the places near to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What's noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs' transport path is mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality, change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport, resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs' environmental behaviors, the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and environmental and ecological impacts. It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to study the physiological and ecological status of human body and ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution.",,,,,"HU, Min/D-1037-2011","HU, Min/0000-0003-4816-9123; Xu, Libo/0000-0002-2591-2300",,,,,,,,,,,,,0023-074X,2095-9419,,,,,2022,67,30,,,,,3565,3579,,10.1360/TB-2021-1236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2021-1236,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000899098900007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite ongoing research efforts, the impact of PS-MPs on mammalian behavior and the mechanisms driving these effects remain incompletely elucidated. Consequently, effective strategies for prevention have yet to be developed. To fill these gaps, C57BL/6 mice were orally administered with 5 & mu;m PS-MPs for 28 consecutive days in this study. The open-field test and the elevated plus-maze test were performed to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior, 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis were used to detect the changes of gut microbiota and serum metabolites. Our results indicated that PS-MPs exposure activated hippocampal inflammation and induced anxiety-like behavior in mice. Meanwhile, PS-MPs disturbed the gut microbiota, impaired the intestinal barrier, and aroused peripheral inflammation. Specifically, PS-MPs increased the abundance of pathogenic microbiota Tuzzerella, while lowered the abundance of probiotics Faecalibaculum and Akkermansia. Interestingly, eliminating the gut microbiota protected against the deleterious effects of PS-MPs on intestinal barrier integrity, reduced the levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorated anxiety-like behavior. Additionally, green tea's primary bioactive constituent, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), optimized gut microbial composition, improved intestinal barrier function, reduced peripheral inflammation, and exerted anti-anxiety effects by inhibiting the hippocampal TLR4/MyD88/NF-& kappa;B signaling cascade. EGCG also remodeled serum metabolism, especially modulated purine metabolism. These findings suggested that gut microbiota participates in PS-MPs-induced anxiety-like behavior by modulating the gut-brain axis, and that EGCG could serve as a potential preventive strategy.",,,,,"Wang, Peipei/JUF-6950-2023; zhang, hao/JOJ-7093-2023; wang, jun/JPY-3635-2023; LEI, LEI/JTS-4675-2023; Yang, Fan/JVO-8611-2024; liu, xinyi/KFB-4466-2024; Wang, Chao/JHT-6081-2023; zhang, zhang/KBQ-9978-2024; Liu, yujing/JQI-7225-2023; Zhang, yuxuan/JXM-9935-2024; Liu, Zhiyu/JNR-8043-2023; feng, feng/KBR-1814-2024; xiao, wei/KCK-6954-2024; Zhang, Zixuan/JSL-3603-2023; Chen, Zheng/KCY-2338-2024; wu, xiaokang/JUJ-4602-2023; yin, yue/JQV-9753-2023; liu, xingwang/KCY-1277-2024; xu, wei/JZD-2112-2024; li, mengyang/JWO-9551-2024; FENG, X/JPL-4188-2023; Liu, Zhe/KEJ-5299-2024; Li, Xinyue/JVN-4601-2024; liu, feng/KCL-0778-2024; li, rui/JVM-8999-2024; yang, zhou/KBB-6972-2024; wang, wenjuan/JGD-0428-2023; wang, jiaqi/JSL-7112-2023; Wei, Wei/JVM-8876-2024; li, liu/JXN-7328-2024; LIU, HUI/JPX-8014-2023; zhao, lin/JPK-8436-2023; zhang, can/KHC-5357-2024; Zhang, Bo/JVD-9890-2024; wang, wang/JQW-3034-2023; chen, yu/JUF-6847-2023; Chen, Xiao/KBD-1464-2024; Liu, qi/JZT-5038-2024; huang, libo/JMB-4345-2023; Wang, Zejun/KBB-8454-2024; Liu, Shaobo/JUU-5767-2023; Yang, Yifan/JTV-1487-2023; wang, qiang/IZW-1751-2023; Lu, Wang/JVO-0416-2024; Jing, Jing/JSK-6237-2023; Wu, Yun/JTV-1065-2023; wang, yingying/JSK-6741-2023; Liu, Xiong/JWO-1231-2024; Jin, Jin/JTV-5024-2023; Sun, Jia/JXM-0311-2024; LI, YUN/JTV-7108-2023; lei, lei/JSL-3106-2023; wang, xi/JNT-5162-2023; jing, wang/KCZ-2144-2024; ZHENG, YI/KAM-6536-2024; Yuan, Fang/JQV-7426-2023; Yang, Fan/JMA-9594-2023; chen, xu/JNT-3068-2023; chen, gang/JRX-1197-2023; wang, yue/ISA-4119-2023; Chen, Nuo/JZD-0344-2024; Liu, Zhihao/JUF-7651-2023; Wang, Chen/JZE-6385-2024; Wang, Xingyu/JNE-0602-2023; Lin, Lin/JTU-1595-2023; Ding, Yang/JUV-4842-2023; LI, LI/KCJ-5600-2024; wang, chen/JED-7289-2023; wang, hang/JND-8481-2023; yang, zhou/JKI-3744-2023; wang, Xiaoming/KBB-8854-2024","Liu, Zhiyu/0000-0001-8351-1268; wang, wenjuan/0000-0002-4220-8817; Wei, Wei/0000-0002-4109-3878; Liu, Xiong/0000-0001-9021-3031; Yang, Jian-Zheng/0000-0003-0659-9790",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,SEP 20,2023,892,,,,,,,,164619,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164619,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.164619,,JUN 2023,,,,,,37269995,,,,,WOS:001022338700001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb)were the metals examined. Soil analysis also was carried out for the same elements. The tissues and bones of the fishes were separated before further analysis was made. Drying process technique was used to determine the moisture content for all samples at 80 ? for 24 hours. Water content ranged between 70 & 77%. Triplicate samples were evaluated by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) to find out heavy metals concentration. Oven and Teflon beakers were used to fully digest all solid samples at 120 ? for 3 hours. Highest readings of Zn, Ni and Pb were found in the fish bone for the samples collected from both mentioned locations. However, different pattern was noticed for Cu where higher values were found in the tissues for the same samples. Values of Pb in the tissues were higher than the acceptable value in edible fish by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); 1 ppm and Malaysian Food Act (MFR) & World Health Organization (WHO); 2 ppm, whereas values of Cu, Zn were in the acceptable range set by the same organizations. No values recommended for Ni by MFR. In general heavy metals in the bones and tissues from both locations can be sorted in descending order as follows; Pb > Zn > Cu > Ni. Soil samples collected from both locations showed different pattern where high concentration was found for Zn followed by Pb then Cu and Ni. Moreover analysis for soil samples collected from Paka River showed higher content for all elements compared to Kijal.

Experiments were conducted using a batch technique, the fenobucarb-spiked paddy soils were shaken end-over-end with solutions of pH 7, pH 9, 25 mg L-1 DOC, and 1 critical micelle (cmc) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After each period (24, 48, 72, horizontal ellipsis 144 hours), the soil solutions were separated into the aliquot and the solid phase to analyze fenobucarb and intermediate metabolic products 2-sec-butyl phenol. The decrease of fenobucarb and the appearance of (2-sec-butyl-phenol) were the result of hydrolysis and biodegradation by fenobucarb-acclimatized microorganisms that were capable of degrading fenobucarb in the paddy soil. The degradation of fenobucarb in both the soil and water phases in the paddy soil-water system was enhanced in the experiment with pH 7, followed by those with pH 9, 25 mg L-1 DOC, and 1 cmc SDS. With pH 9, in addition to decomposition by bacteria present in the soil, fenobucarb was hydrolyzed under basic conditions. The presence of 25 mg L-1 DOC and 1 cmc SDS in the aqueous solution increased desorption and microbial activity in the soil and increased the biodegradation efficiency of fenobucarb in the paddy soil-water system. However, the degradation of fenobucarb in the 1 cmc SDS solution was inhibited because SDS solution may be preferentially utilized by microorganisms, and fenobucarb would have a competitive effect with SDS. Irrigation water for paddy fields often receives untreated domestic and industrial wastewater that may contain multiple compounds such as DOC and SDS. Therefore, it contributes to the elimination of fenobucarb insecticide in the paddy soil-water system.",,,,,"Strobel, Bjarne W./E-8980-2010","Strobel, Bjarne W./0000-0001-9680-1715",,,,,,,,,,,,,1532-0383,1549-7887,,,,JAN 2,2024,33,1,,,,,102,113,,10.1080/15320383.2023.2185449,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15320383.2023.2185449,,MAR 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000942694400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

For environmental epidemiological studies, measuring the metallic components of PM2.5 collected by personal samplers and quartz fiber filters (QFF) has two key advantages: reducing exposure misclassification and enabling analyses of multiple (organic and inorganic) components on a single filter. We developed a sensitive, low-sample-consumption method to quantify the metallic components of PM2.5 collected on QFFs using micro-synchrotron radiation Xray fluorescence (mu-SRXRF). Teflon filter is used here as a reference to test the substrate applicability of QFF. This method requires only a 5-mm-diameter portion of a QFF and can simultaneously quantify 15 metals with atomic numbers Z = 19-34 (i.e., K-Se, excluding Sc). The analysis time for each sample was 120-360 s, and the method detection limits were 0.04-36.6 ng/m3. We validated this method by performing cross-comparisons with two external methods: offline inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and online X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The slopes of the linear fits between the mu-SRXRF and offline ICP-MS methods varied from 0.40 to 1, with R2 values ranging from 0.62 to 0.98. The slopes of the linear fits between the mu-SRXRF and online XRF methods were between 0.29 and 0.89, with R2 values ranging from 0.39 to 0.80. We applied the proposed method to analyze 391 personal PM2.5 samples collected in an epidemiological study conducted in urban Beijing. By comparing the results with the ambient concentrations from a fixed monitoring site, we found that the con-centrations of some metallic components in personal PM2.5 samples were significantly different from those in the corresponding fixed-site samples, with up to an order of magnitude difference. Because personal sampling can reduce the potential for exposure misclassifications, the high-resolution temporal analysis of metallic compo-nents in personal samples using the mu-SRXRF method could be a useful approach for exploring the health risks and identifying the sources of metallic components of PM2.5.",,,,,"Zhang, Tianle/AFL-7285-2022; ZHU, TONG/H-6501-2011; Yao, Yuan/JSK-2558-2023","Zhang, Tianle/0000-0003-2611-9723; ZHU, TONG/0000-0002-2752-7924; Yao, Yuan/0000-0001-5981-2060",,,,,,,,,,,,,1352-2310,1873-2844,,,,FEB 1,2024,318,,,,,,,,120205,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.120205,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.120205,,NOV 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001125937500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The clinical features of PCOS include hyperandrogenemia and polycystic ovarian changes. Bailing capsule (BL), a proprietary Chinese medicine that contains fermented Cordyceps sinensis powder, has been applied to treat PCOS. However, the specific active ingredients of BL and its mechanisms of action are yet to be elucidated.MethodsInitially, the effectiveness of BL on PCOS model mice was evaluated. Subsequently, the active ingredients of BL were searched in the TCMSP and TCM Systems Pharmacology databases, and their targets were predicted using Swiss Target Prediction and SEA databases. Furthermore, the GEO gene database was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to PCOS. Data from Gene Card, OMIM, DDT, and Drugbank databases were then combined to establish a PCOS disease gene library. Cross targets were imported into the STRING database to construct a protein-protein interaction network. In addition, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape and DAVID databases and visualized using Cytoscape software and R 4.2.3. The core targets were docked with SYBYL-X software, and their expressions in PCOS mice were further verified using qPCR.ResultsThe core active ingredients of BL were identified to be linoleyl acetate, cholesteryl palmitate, arachidonic acid, among others. Microarray data sets from four groups containing disease and normal samples were obtained from the GEO database. A total of 491 DEGs and 106 drug-disease cross genes were selected. Estrous cycle and ovarian lesions were found to be improved in PCOS model mice following BL treatment. While the levels of testosterone, progesterone, and prolactin decreased, that of estradiol increased. qPCR findings indicated that the expressions of JAK2, PPARG, PI3K, and AKT1 were upregulated, whereas those of ESR1 and IRS1 were downregulated in PCOS model mice. After the administration of BL, the expressions of associated genes were regulated. This study demonstrated that BL exerted anti-PCOS effects via PIK3CA, ESR1, AKT, PPARG, and IRS1 targets affecting PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.DiscussionThis research clarified the multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel action of BL and provided a theoretical reference for further investigations on its pharmacological basis and molecular mechanisms against PCOS.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2662-7671,,,,DEC 15,2023,23,1,,,,,,,458,10.1186/s12906-023-04280-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12906-023-04280-6,,,,,,,,38102584,,,,,WOS:001125495000003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Sixteen EP and their corresponding NP were excised from the brain-dead voluntary organ donors with no clinical history of low back pain, and 12 herniated and 8 degenerated NP tissues isolated from the patients undergoing spinal surgery were subjected to study the alteration in the microbial diversity. Objective(s)To understand in normal IVD, whether the colonization of bacteria to the NP is through the EP in discs with intact annulus fibrosus. To identify significantly differing microbial population(s) between normal and diseased IVD (NP). Background of the studyThere is increasing evidence for subclinical infection by fastidious low, growing bacteria to be a cause of disc degeneration. Although the presence of bacteria in NP has been reported well in literature, the source of bacteria is not clearly proved as the disc is avascular in healthy condition. Documentation of similar bacterial populations in the EP and NP may add proof that bacterial inoculation of NP occurs via the EP. Materials and methodsSixteen EP and their corresponding NP excised from brain-dead voluntary organ donors with no history of back pain and 20 diseased discs collected from patients undergoing microdiscectomy/fusion surgery were used for profiling microbiome through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing using primers specific for V1-V9 hypervariable regions. Changes in bacterial diversity and abundance were analysed to identify the key microbial populations in normal IVD NP and EP tissues and those significantly altered in diseased IVD (NP). ResultsNP and EP shared a similar spectrum of microbiome but with varying abundance. The five dominant phyla identified were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, OD1, and Bacteroidetes. Proteobacteria was found to be the most abundant phyla in both NP (62%) and EP (53%) of the normal IVD. This was followed by Firmicutes (16%), Actinobacteriota (11%), OD1 (Parcubacteria) (7.6%), and Bacteroidetes (2%) in NP and Firmicutes (23.4%), OD1 (Parcubacteria) (17.6%), Actinobacteriota (2.8%), and Bacteroidetes (2.6%) in EP, respectively. Under diseased conditions, Proteobacteria (68%) was dominant when compared with other phyla. However, there was no significant difference in the abundance of Proteobacteria between the normal and diseased discs. Interestingly, the other dominant phyla such as Firmicutes (Normal-NP: 16.2%; Diseased-NP: 4.02%) and Actinobacteria (Normal-NP: 11%; Diseased-NP: 0.99%) showed a significant reduction in degenerated discs. To understand the key microbial populations that are significantly altered during disease, correlation analysis was performed among the three phyla, which revealed a negative correlation in the ratio of Actinobacteria + Firmicutes vs. Proteobacteria (p = 0.001) in DD. ConclusionResults of our study clearly demonstrated a similar bacterial diversity but with varying abundance between the EP and NP, suggesting the existence of the endplate-nucleus pulposus axis in the normal IVD microbiome. Further, our results have indicated that the changes in the abundance of Actinobacteria + Firmicutes vs. Proteobacteria during DDD need further investigation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2297-055X,,,,,SEP 28,2022,9,,,,,,,,927652,10.3389/fcvm.2022.927652,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fcvm.2022.927652,,,,,,,,36247458,,,,,WOS:000868249400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In this review, we systematically assessed the occurrence of PFAA precursors in agricultural soils, taking into account their sources and biodegradation pathways. In addition, we summarized the findings of the relevant literature on the uptake and biotransformation of PFAA precursors by agricultural plants. The applications of biosolids/composts and pesticides are the main sources of PFAA precursors in agricultural soils. The physicochemical properties of PFAA precursors, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, and plant species are the key factors influencing plant root uptakes of PFAA precursors from soils.

A meta-analysis to explore their relationship was conducted. Given the high correlation and overlap of MetS with diabetes, analysis of diabetes risk, was used as a supplement to compare with MetS. Seven studies included MetS, 15 studies for diabetes, and one study included both outcomes. It was found that PCBs may not be a risk factor for MetS, but their high heterogeneity indicates that they are under-represented. In addition, our results showed that total PCBs might be a protective factor against diabetes. In the whole blood subgroup, which can reflect the accumulation of more than one body load, heterogeneity was reduced, and its OR value suggested that PCBs increased the risk of MetS in the whole blood biomaterial. DL-PCBs were positively associated with MetS and diabetes, while NDL-PCBs were negatively associated with diabetes. In the subgroup analysis of PCBs homologs, DL-PCB-126 and DL-PCB-118 were risk factors for MetS and diabetes, respectively. In addition, PCB153 and 180 showed a dose-response relationship between them and diabetes mellitus, respectively. The results of total analysis of MetS and diabetes mellitus and subgroup analysis of PCBs were mixed, and this reason might be attributed to the different mechanisms of action and effect sizes of different PCBs, so based on subgroup results and in vivo and in vitro experiments, we considered PCBs to be a risk factor for MetS and diabetes. Due to various reasons, there are still many shortcomings in the evaluation of PCBs impact on human health, and more high-quality research are needed to further explore the role of PCBs of different species and congeners in MetS and diabetes.",,,,,"xu, lingzhi/JVZ-8748-2024","Gao, Xin/0009-0005-1263-4021; Zhai, Jinxia/0000-0003-3742-4125",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,NOV 20,2023,900,,,,,,,,165773,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165773,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165773,,AUG 2023,,,,,,37506918,,,,,WOS:001051886400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

J,"Dong, SM; Hickman, LC",,,,"Dong, Shirley M.; Hickman, Lisa C.",,,Current opinion: postpartum urinary disorders,CURRENT OPINION IN OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic [1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment [2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8% of patients reporting these issues [2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility [3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence [2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling [5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations [6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation [7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction [6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence [3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles [3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45% [9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically [3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void [3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down [3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention [5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture [3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery [8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs [5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume [11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) [12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities [12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer [14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation [15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities [16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan [17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.[3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17. 1% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education [18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR [19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery [19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment [20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying [20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination [21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR [22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life [24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64% of pregnancies and 15-30% of individuals in the first year postpartum [25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference [4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value [26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period [9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established [2,27,28]. Simple questions such as Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine? may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence [9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience [27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients [24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy [29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence [30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith [31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith [31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum [32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum [32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery [33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections [34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas [34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage [35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic [1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment [2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8% of patients reporting these issues [2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility [3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence [2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling [5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations [6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation [7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction [6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence [3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles [3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45% [9].

Many metals and toxic elements, along with poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known to induce immunomodulation and have previously been linked to increased pathogen prevalence and infectious disease severity. In this study, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) was investigated at the coast of Helgeland in northern Norway. This population is commonly infected with the parasitic nematode gapeworm (Syngamus trachea), with a prevalence of 40-60 % during summer months. Gapeworm induces severe respiratory disease in birds and has been previously demonstrated to decrease survival and reproductive success in wild house sparrows. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a higher exposure to pollution with PFASs, metals and other elements influences gapeworm infection in wild house sparrows. We conducted PFASs and elemental analysis on whole blood from 52 house sparrows from Helgeland, including analyses of highly toxic metals such as lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As). In addition, we studied gapeworm infection load by counting the parasite eggs in faeces from each individual. We also studied the expression of microRNA 155 (miR155) as a key regulator in the immune system. Elevated blood concentrations of Pb were found to be associated with an increased prevalence of gapeworm infection in the house sparrow. The expression of miR155 in the plasma of the house sparrow was only weakly associated with Pb. In contrast, we found relatively low PFASs concentrations in the house sparrow blood ( n-ary sumation PFASs 0.00048-354 mu g/L) and PFASs were not associated to miR155 nor infection rate.

Perfluoroalkyl exposure aberrantly modulates lipid, metabolite, and bile acid levels, increasing susceptibility to onset and severity of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. To date, most studies in humans have focused on perfluoroalkyl-exposure effects in adults. In this study we aimed to show if perfluoroalkyls are present in the human fetal liver and if they have metabolic consequences for the human fetus. Methods In this cross-sectional study, human fetal livers from elective termination of pregnancies at the Aberdeen Pregnancy Counselling Service, Aberdeen, UK, were analysed by both targeted (bile acids and perfluoroalkyl substances) and combined targeted and untargeted (lipids and polar metabolites) mass spectrometry based metabolomic analyses, as well as with RNA-Seq. Only fetuses from normally progressing pregnancies (determined at ultrasound scan before termination), terminated for non-medical reasons, from women older than 16 years, fluent in English, and between 11 and 21 weeks of gestation were collected. Women exhibiting considerable emotional distress or whose fetuses had anomalies identified at ultrasound scan were excluded. Stringent bioinformatic and statistical methods such as partial correlation network analysis, linear regression, and pathway analysis were applied to this data to investigate the association of perfluoroalkyl exposure with hepatic metabolic pathways. Findings Fetuses included in this study were collected between Dec 2, 2004, and Oct 27, 2014. 78 fetuses were included in the study: all 78 fetuses were included in the metabolomics analysis (40 female and 38 male) and 57 fetuses were included in the RNA-Seq analysis (28 female and 29 male). Metabolites associated with perfluoroalkyl were identified in the fetal liver and these varied with gestational age. Conjugated bile acids were markedly positively associated with fetal age. 23 amino acids, fatty acids, and sugar derivatives in fetal livers were inversely associated with perfluoroalkyl exposure, and the bile acid glycolithocholic acid was markedly positively associated with all quantified perfluoroalkyl. Furthermore, 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, a marker of bile acid synthesis rate, was strongly positively associated with perfluoroalkyl levels and was detectable as early as gestational week 12. Interpretation Our study shows direct evidence for the in utero effects of perfluoroalkyl exposure on specific key hepatic products. Our results provide evidence that perfluoroalkyl exposure, with potential future consequences, manifests in the human fetus as early as the first trimester of gestation. Furthermore, the profiles of metabolic changes resemble those observed in perinatal perfluoroalkyl exposures. Such exposures are already linked with susceptibility, initiation, progression, and exacerbation of a wide range of metabolic diseases.

Leveraging a larger set of literature searches conducted to synthesize results from longitudinal studies of potentially modifiable risk factors for childhood ADHD, we present meta-analytic results from 66 studies that examined the associations between early chemical exposures and later ADHD diagnosis or symptoms. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the chemical exposure occurred at least 6 months prior to measurement of ADHD diagnosis or symptomatology. Included papers were published between 1975 and 2019 on exposure to anesthetics (n = 5), cadmium (n = 3), hexachlorobenzene (n = 4), lead (n = 22), mercury (n = 12), organophosphates (n = 7), and polychlorinated biphenyls (n = 13). Analyses are presented for each chemical exposure by type of ADHD outcome reported (categorical vs. continuous), type of ADHD measurement (overall measures of ADHD, ADHD symptoms only, ADHD diagnosis only, inattention only, hyperactivity/impulsivity only), and timing of exposure (prenatal vs. childhood vs. cumulative), whenever at least 3 relevant effect sizes were available. Childhood lead exposure was positively associated with ADHD diagnosis and symptoms in all analyses except for the prenatal analyses (odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.60 to 2.62, correlation coefficients (CCs) ranging from 0.14 to 0.16). Other statistically significant associations were limited to organophosphates (CC = 0.11, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.19 for continuous measures of ADHD outcomes overall), polychlorinated biphenyls (CC = 0.08, 95% CI: 0.02-0.14 for continuous measures of inattention as the outcome), and both prenatal and childhood mercury exposure (CC = 0.02, 95% CI: 0.00-0.04 for continuous measures of ADHD outcomes overall for either exposure window). Our findings provide further support for negative impacts of prenatal and/or childhood exposure to certain chemicals and raise the possibility that primary prevention and targeted screening could prevent or mitigate ADHD symptomatology. Furthermore, these findings support the need for regular review of regulations as our scientific understanding of the risks posed by these chemicals evolves.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1389-4986,1573-6695,,,,2023 DEC 18,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s11121-023-01601-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11121-023-01601-6,,DEC 2023,,,,,,38108946,,,,,WOS:001126023000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

They can have adverse effects on the morphology, physiology, growth, and development of different organs and systems, among these bone health can be affected too. EDCs work as agonists or antagonists on hormonal receptors in hormone-sensitive cells, influence gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms, stimulate or inhibit cell maturation, and affect the synthesis and metabolism of hormones. This review aims to summarize current evidence on the effects of exposure to EDCs on bone from early gestational to birth and long-term adverse effects. Single and mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals can disrupt bone structure by modifying differentiation, increasing osteoclast activity, inhibiting pre-osteoblasts differentiation into mature osteoblasts and osteocytes, inducing changes in signaling pathways downstream of receptors, and ultimately remodeling and modifying the equilibrium between bone resorption and formation leading to increased bone resorption, morphological, and functional changes in bone maturation. EDCs can affect the IGF system, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin gene expression. Findings are relative to both in vitro and in vivo studies. Studies have shown that prenatal exposure to EDCs leads to growth retardation, delayed ossification, and changes in bone length and size and in bone geometry with a lowering of bone mineral density and area-adjusted bone mineral content. Current knowledge on bone health, growth, mineral content, and development from molecular to clinical findings highlights how endocrine-disrupting chemicals can negatively affect these processes. Mechanisms, however, are not fully understood and need further investigation.",,,,,,"Shulhai, Anna-Mariia/0000-0002-7849-4560",,,,,,,,,,,,,2451-9766,2451-9685,,,,2023 NOV 28,2023,,,,,,,,,,10.1007/s12403-023-00607-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12403-023-00607-3,,NOV 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001107453300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

In some studies, these neurotoxicants impact males and females differently. We aimed to examine the sex-specific effects of exposure to developmental neurotoxicants on intelligence (IQ) in a systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodWe screened abstracts published in PsychINFO and PubMed before December 31st, 2021, for empirical studies of six neurotoxicants (lead, mercury, PCBs, PBDEs, OPPs, and phthalates) that (1) used an individualized biomarker; (2) measured exposure during the prenatal period or before age six; and (3) provided effect estimates on general, nonverbal, and/or verbal IQ by sex. We assessed each study for risk of bias and evaluated the certainty of the evidence using Navigation Guide. We performed separate random effect meta-analyses by sex and timing of exposure with subgroup analyses by neurotoxicant.ResultsFifty-one studies were included in the systematic review and 20 in the meta-analysis. Prenatal exposure to developmental neurotoxicants was associated with decreased general and nonverbal IQ in males, especially for lead. No significant effects were found for verbal IQ, or postnatal lead exposure and general IQ. Due to the limited number of studies, we were unable to analyze postnatal effects of any of the other neurotoxicants.ConclusionDuring fetal development, males may be more vulnerable than females to general and nonverbal intellectual deficits from neurotoxic exposures, especially from lead. More research is needed to examine the nuanced sex-specific effects found for postnatal exposure to toxic chemicals.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1476-069X,,,,NOV 17,2023,22,1,,,,,,,80,10.1186/s12940-023-01029-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12940-023-01029-z,,,,,,,,37978510,,,,,WOS:001103508100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

There is, however, no comprehensive, regulatory, post-market monitoring for human health effects of plastic-associated chemicals or particles and it is unclear how many of these have been investigated for effects in humans, and therefore what the knowledge gaps are. Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of peer-reviewed human studies investigating the potential effects of exposure to plastic-associated particles/chemicals on health to identify research gaps and provide recommendations for future research and regulation policy. Methods: Medline and Embase databases were used to identify peer-reviewed primary human studies published in English from Jan 1960 - Jan 2022 that investigated relationships between exposures to included plasticassociated particles/chemicals measured and detected in bio-samples and human health outcomes. Plasticassociated particles/chemicals included are: micro and nanoplastics, due to their widespread occurrence and potential for human exposure; polymers, the main building blocks of plastic; plasticizers and flame retardants, the two most common types of plastic additives with the highest concentration ranges in plastic materials; and bisphenols and per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances, two chemical classes of known health concern that are common in plastics. We extracted metadata on the population and study characteristics (country, intergenerational, sex, age, general/special exposure risk status, study design), exposure (plastic-associated particle/ chemical, multiple exposures), and health outcome measures (biochemical, physiological, and/or clinical), from which we produced the interactive database 'Plastic Health Map' and a narrative summary. Results: We identified 100,949 unique articles, of which 3,587 met our inclusion criteria and were used to create a systematic evidence map. The Plastic Health Map with extracted metadata from included studies are freely available at https://osf.io/fhw7d/ and summary tables, plots and overall observations are included in this report. Conclusions: We present the first evidence map compiling human health research on a wide range of plasticassociated chemicals from several different chemical classes, in order to provide stakeholders, including researchers, regulators, and concerned individuals, with an efficient way to access published literature on the matter and determine knowledge gaps. We also provide examples of data clusters to facilitate systematic reviews and research gaps to help direct future research efforts. Extensive gaps are identified in the breadth of populations, exposures and outcomes addressed in studies of potential human health effects of plastic-associated chemicals. No studies of the human health effects of micro and/or nanoplastics were found, and no studies were found for 26/1,202 additives included in our search that are of known hazard concern and confirmed to be in active production. Few studies have addressed recent substitution chemicals for restricted additives such as organophosphate flame retardants, phthalate substitutes, and bisphenol analogues. We call for a paradigm shift in chemical regulation whereby new plastic chemicals are rigorously tested for safety before being introduced in consumer products, with ongoing post-introduction biomonitoring of their levels in humans and health effects throughout individuals' life span, including in old age and across generations.",,,,,"Solomons, Terena/Q-9917-2017","Solomons, Terena/0000-0002-7741-2260",,,,,,,,,,,,,0160-4120,1873-6750,,,,NOV,2023,181,,,,,,,,108225,10.1016/j.envint.2023.108225,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envint.2023.108225,,NOV 2023,,,,,,37948868,,,,,WOS:001112339200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Objectives: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of human observational studies using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) framework to explore the association of per ten-fold increase of pesticide concentrations in maternal biological samples during pregnancy with risk of preterm birth and length of gestational age at birth. Data source: Five English (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus) and 3 Chinese databases (China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)) were searched till Jan 18th, 2023. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: To be included, pesticide exposure should be measured in maternal biological samples during pregnancy and in log-transformed forms. The primary outcome was preterm birth and the secondary outcome was gestational age at birth. Study appraisal, synthesis methods and confidence assessment: Quality of studies was evaluated using OHAT Risk of Bias Tool. Evidence was quantitatively synthesized with Correlated and Hierarchical Effects (CHE) model. The confidence rating in the body of evidence was done using OHAT. Results: A total of 21 studies reported by 18 papers were included, with 7 studies for preterm birth and 19 for gestational age at birth. The meta-analysis found a ten-fold increase of pesticide concentrations was potentially associated with risk of preterm birth (pooled OR = 1.28; 95%CI: 0.93, 1.78) and shortened gestational age at birth (beta = -0.10; 95%CI: -0.21, 0.01).

This systematic review of epidemiological studies examined the association between maternal exposure to EDCs during pregnancy and the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the offspring.Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception to November 17, 2022, for studies investigating the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and outcomes related to ASD. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023389386).Results: We included 27 observational studies assessing prenatal exposure to phthalates (8 studies), polychlorinated biphenyls (8 studies), organophosphate pesticides (8 studies), phenols (7 studies), perfluoroalkyl substances (6 studies), organochlorine pesticides (5 studies), brominated flame retardants (3 studies), dioxins (1 study), and parabens (1 study). The number of examined children ranged from 77 to 1,556, the age at the assessment of autistic traits ranged from 3 to 14 years, and most studies assessed autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale. All but one study was considered to have a low risk of bias. Overall, there was no association between maternal exposure to specific ECDs during pregnancy and the occurrence of autistic traits in offspring.Conclusions: Findings from the epidemiological studies evaluated here do not support an association between prenatal exposure to ECDs and the likelihood of autistic traits in later in life. These findings should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of the absence of neurodevelopment effects of EDCs affecting ASD risk, given the limitations of current studies such as representative exposure assessment, small sample sizes, inadequacy to assess sexually dimorphic effects, or the effects of EDC mixtures. Future studies should carefully address these limitations.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1664-2392,,,,,JUN 9,2023,14,,,,,,,,1184546,10.3389/fendo.2023.1184546,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2023.1184546,,,,,,,,37361542,,,,,WOS:001017604000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, there are controversial outcomes in RRD cases involving the lower quadrants. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PPV combined air tamponade in patients with RRD compared with PPV combined gas tamponade and whether it could be a safe alternative to PPV combined gas tamponade. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases published until September 2022 were comprehensively searched for studies that compared PPV combined with air tamponade and gas tamponade in patients with RRD. The rate of primary treatment success, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and postoperative complications were extracted from the final eligible studies. The mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR) were calculated for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively, with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 8 studies with 668 eyes in the air tamponade group and 944 in the gas tamponade group were included. There was no significant difference in the rate of primary treatment success between the air tamponade group and the gas tamponade group (RR = 1.00, P = 0.79). In addition, the subgroup analysis suggested that whether retinal breaks were located above or below, there was no significant difference in either rate of primary treatment success (RR = 0.99, P = 0.89; RR = 1.02, P = 0.45). There was no significant difference in mean BCVA 3 months after surgery (MD = -0.02, P = 0.50). For postoperative complications, mean postoperative IOP was lower in the air tamponade at one day (MD = -4.24, P < 0.001), and there was no significant difference between the two groups at 7 days (MD = -0.45, P = 0.71), one month (MD = -0.69, P = 0.33), and 3 months (MD = 0.69, P = 0.35) after surgery. The rate of epiretinal membrane (ERM) development was lower in the air tamponade group (RR = 0.48, P = 0.04).

A systematic meta-analysis of literature about passive moss biomonitoring,ENVIRONMENT DEVELOPMENT AND SUSTAINABILITY,,,,,,,,,,,,"Surging incidents of air quality-related public health hazards, and environmental degradation, have prompted the global authorities to seek newer avenues of air quality monitoring, especially in developing economies, where the situation appears most alarming besides difficulties around 'adequate' deployment of air quality sensors. In the present narrative, we adopt a systematic review methodology (PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) around recent global literature (2002-2022), around moss-based passive biomonitoring approaches which might offer the regulatory authorities a complementary means to fill 'gaps' in existing air quality records. Following the 4-phased search procedure under PRISMA, total of 123 documents were selected for review. A wealth of research demonstrates how passive biomonitoring, with strategic use of mosses, could become an invaluable regulatory (and research) tool to monitor atmospheric deposition patterns and help identifying the main drivers of air quality changes (e.g., anthropogenic and/or natural). Besides individual studies, we briefly reflect on the European Moss Survey, underway since 1990, which aptly showcases mosses as 'naturally occurring' sensors of ambient air quality for a slew of metals (heavy and trace) and persistent organic pollutants, and help assessing spatio-temporal changes therein. To that end, we urge the global research community to conduct targeted research around various pollutant uptake mechanisms by mosses (e.g., species-specific interactions, environmental conditions, land management practices). Of late, mosses have found various environmental applications as well, such as in epidemiological investigations, identification of pollutant sources and transport mechanisms, assessment of air quality in diverse and complex urban ecosystems, and even detecting short-term changes in ambient air quality (e.g., COVID-19 Lockdown), each being critical for the authorities to develop informed and strategic regulatory measures. To that end, we review current literature and highlight to the regulatory authorities how to extend moss-based observations, by integrating them with a wide range of ecological indicators to assess regional environmental vulnerability/risk due to degrading air quality. Overall, an underlying motive behind this narrative was to broaden the current regulatory outlook and purview, to bolster and diversify existing air quality monitoring initiatives, by coupling the moss-based outputs with the traditional, sensor-based datasets, and attain improved spatial representation. However, we also make a strong case of conducting more targeted research to fill in the 'gaps' in our current understanding of moss-based passive biomonitoring details, with increased case studies.",,,,,,"Chaudhuri, Sriroop/0000-0002-0380-6128",,,,,,,,,,,,,1387-585X,1573-2975,,,,MAR,2024,26,3,,,,,5735,5773,,10.1007/s10668-023-03043-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10668-023-03043-0,,FEB 2023,,,,,,37363020,,,,,WOS:000940295800002,View Full Record in Web of Science

After 252 d and 330 d of incubation with PFPiAs in Soil N and Y respectively, the levels of PFPiAs decreased distinctly, accompanied by the increasing perfluorohexaphosphonic acid (PFHxPA) or perfluorooctanophosphonic acid (PFOPA) formation, magnifying PFPiAs were susceptible to C-P cleavage, which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. The half-lives of the PFPiAs were longer than one year, while generally shorter in Soil N than in Soil Y and that of C6/C6 was shorter than C8/C8 PFPiA (392 d and 746 d in Soil N, and 603 and 1155 d in Soil Y, respectively).

These exposures often represent a complex mixture of different stressors, challenging the ability to delineate the mechanisms and risk factors underlying exposure-disease relationships. The use of omics measurement approaches that enable characterization of biological marker patterns provide internal indicators of molecular alterations, which could be used to identify bioeffects following exposure to a toxicant. Metabolomics is the comprehensive analysis of small molecule present in biological samples, and allows identification of potential modes of action and altered pathways by systematic measurement of metabolites. Objectives The aim of this study is to review the application of metabolomics studies for use in occupational health, with a focus on applying metabolomics for exposure monitoring and its relationship to occupational diseases. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published up to 2021. Results Most of reviewed studies included worker populations exposed to heavy metals such as As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn and organic compounds such as tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, trichloroethylene, polyfluoroalkyl, acrylamide, polyvinyl chloride. Occupational exposures were associated with changes in metabolites and pathways, and provided novel insight into the relationship between exposure and disease outcomes.

J,"Eberle, C; Stichling, S",,,,"Eberle, Claudia; Stichling, Stefanie",,,Environmental health influences in pregnancy and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus: a systematic review,BMC PUBLIC HEALTH,,,,,,,,,,,,"Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy complications globally. Environmental risk factors may lead to increased glucose levels and GDM, which in turn may affect not only the health of the mother but assuming hypotheses of fetal programming, also the health of the offspring. In addition to traditional GDM risk factors, the evidence is growing that environmental influences might affect the development of GDM. We conducted a systematic review analyzing the association between several environmental health risk factors in pregnancy, including climate factors, chemicals and metals, and GDM. Methods We performed a systematic literature search in Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science Core Collection databases for research articles published until March 2021. Epidemiological human and animal model studies that examined GDM as an outcome and / or glycemic outcomes and at least one environmental risk factor for GDM were included. Results Of n = 91 studies, we classified n = 28 air pollution, n = 18 persistent organic pollutants (POP), n = 11 arsenic, n = 9 phthalate n = 8 bisphenol A (BPA), n = 8 seasonality, n = 6 cadmium and n = 5 ambient temperature studies. In total, we identified two animal model studies. Whilst we found clear evidence for an association between GDM and air pollution, ambient temperature, season, cadmium, arsenic, POPs and phthalates, the findings regarding phenols were rather inconsistent. There were clear associations between adverse glycemic outcomes and air pollution, ambient temperature, season, POPs, phenols, and phthalates. Findings regarding cadmium and arsenic were heterogeneous (n = 2 publications in each case). Conclusions Environmental risk factors are important to consider in the management and prevention of GDM. In view of mechanisms of fetal programming, the environmental risk factors investigated may impair the health of mother and offspring in the short and long term.

PCBs have been of concern due to their anti/estrogen-like effects, which make them more toxic to the female reproductive system. However, there is still a lack of systematic reviews on the reproductive toxicity of PCBs in females, so the adverse effects and mechanisms of PCBs on the female reproductive system were summarized in this paper. Our findings showed that PCBs are positively associated with lower pregnancy rate, hormone disruption, miscarriage and various reproductive diseases in women. In animal experiments, PCBs can damage the structure and function of the ovaries, uterus and oviducts. Also, PCBs could produce epigenetic effects and be transferred to the offspring through the maternal placenta, causing development retardation, malformation and death of embryos, and damage to organs of multiple generations. Furthermore, the mechanisms of PCBs -induced female reproductive toxicity mainly include receptor -mediated hormone disorders, oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and epigenetic modifications. Finally, we also present some directions for future research on the reproductive toxicity of PCBs.

A meta-analysis was complementarily analysed through the literature to map out the occurrence and fate of MPs and 10 different groups of OCs. The data demonstrate that MPs (54.7% occurrence rate) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants (44.2% occurrence rate) account for the highest prevalence of contaminants in biosolids. In turn, dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs) have the lowest rates (<0.01%). The occurrence of several OCs (e.g., dioxin, perand polyfluoroalkyl substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceutical and personal care products, ultraviolet filters, phosphate flame retardants) in Europe appear at higher rates than in Asia and the Americas. However, MP concentrations in biosolids from Australia are reported to be 10 times higher than in America and Europe, which required more measurement data for in-depth analysis. Amongst the OC groups, brominated flame retardants exhibited exceptional sorption to biosolids with partitioning coefficients (log Kd) higher than 4.

Despite this prevalence, limited information is available regarding its hepatotoxicity biomarkers. In this study, toxicokinetic simulations indicated that under repeated treatment, HFPO-DA in mice serum reached a steady state by the 4th day. To assess its subacute hepatic effects and identify potential biomarkers, mice were administered HFPO-DA orally at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 12.5, or 62.5 mg/kg/d for 7 d. Results revealed that the lowest observed adverse effect levels were 0.5 mg/kg/d for hepatomegaly and 2.5 mg/kg/d for hepatic injury. Serum metabolomics analysis identified 34, 58, and 118 differential metabolites in the 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mg/kg/d groups, respectively, compared to the control group. Based on weighted gene coexpression network analysis, eight potential hepatotoxicity-related metabolites were identified; among them, kynurenic acid (KA) in mouse serum exhibited the highest correlation with liver injury. Furthermore, liver-targeted metabolomics analysis demonstrated that HFPO-DA exposure induced metabolic migration of the kynurenine pathway from KA to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, resulting in the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway. Notably, pretreatment with KA significantly attenuated liver injury induced by HFPO-DA exposure in mice, highlighting the pivotal roles of KA in the hepatotoxicity of HFPO-DA.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-936X,1520-5851,,,,JAN 16,2024,58,4,,,,,1842,1853,,10.1021/acs.est.3c08033,http://dx.doi.org/10.1021/acs.est.3c08033,,,,,,,,38228288,,,,,WOS:001154872900001,View Full Record in Web of Science

This development is inconsistent with the initiative of carbon neutrality. Despite the growing numbers of published papers on EAOPs, there is still a lack of guidelines regarding carbon neutral wastewater treatment, thus hampering efforts to achieve sustainable development of EAOPs and attain carbon neutrality. This review systematically summarized recent advances of EAOPs and the potential strategies for developing carbon neutral wastewater treatment. The mechanisms, performance, and defects of recent developed EAOPs via improving electrodes, catalysts and processes were discussed systematically. The effective strategies including energy conservation, material savings, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and mineralization mitigation were presented in detail. To conserve energy, the review also investigated the power supply capacity, degradation efficiency and costs in transforming renewable energy into electric energy for EAOPs operation. The wind turbines and photovoltaic cells (PVCs) could performe better than fuel cells and triboelectricity nanogenerators (TENGs). Furthermore, the review explored the carbon offset potential of EAOPs by combining with CO2RR. The carbon offset factor ranged from <1% to similar to 88%.

Since many waste facilities are located adjacent to densely populated areas, these fires could potentially expose large populations to the emitted pollutants. However, at the moment there are only few field studies investigating the impact of waste fire emissions on air quality since the unpredictable nature of these events makes them challenging to capture. This study investigated the impact of a large and persistent un-prescribed fire in a waste storage facility in Stockholm county, Sweden, on the local air quality of two residential areas in close proximity to the fire. In-situ measurements of particulate matter, black carbon and nitrogen oxide concentrations were conducted both during open burning and after the fire was fully covered. In addition, filter samples were collected for offline analysis of organic composition, metal content and toxicity. Strongly increased concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and black carbon were found during the open burning period, especially when the wind was coming from the direction of the fire. In addition, elevated concentrations of particulate heavy metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons were observed in the air during the open burning period.

These variations in different animal models and conditions might have an impact on extrapolating experimental results to humans. Hence, by the meta-analysis, we aimed to clarify and elucidate the species differences in hepatoxicity induced by PBDE exposure in rats and mice across different conditions and moderators. Fourteen in vivo studies that utilized rats and mice models were identified, and data such as author names, year of publication, type of PBDE congeners, rodent species, life stage of exposure, dosage, duration, and hepatoxicity indicators were extracted. The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95% confidence interval (95% CI) was used to evaluate the association between hepatoxicity and PBDE exposure across multiple approaches of measurement. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and interaction analysis were utilized to elucidate the species-related differences among the results of the involved studies. The pooled SMD of hepatoxicity of PBDE exposure in the involved in vivo studies was 1.82 (p = 0.016), indicating exposure to PBDE congeners and mixtures is associated with a significant increase in liver toxicity in rodents. Moreover, findings showed that rats were more sensitive to PBDEs than mice with the BDE-209 had the highest SMD value. Among the life stages of exposure, embryonic stage was found to be the most sensitive to hepatoxicity induced by PBDE congeners. Positive relationships were found between the incidence of hepatoxicity with dosage and duration of exposure to PBDE. Interaction analyses showed significant interactions between rodent species (rats or mice), dosage, length of exposure, and hepatotoxicity endpoints. Rats demonstrated an increased susceptibility to variations in organ weight, histopathological changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress markers. Conversely, mice showed pronounced lipid accumulation and modifications in liver enzyme expression levels. However, significant differences were not found in terms of endoplasmic reticular stress as a mechanistic endpoint for hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, this meta-analysis showed that there might be some species-related differences in hepatoxicity induced by PBDE exposure in rats and mice depending on the parameters used.

The population of the Canary Islands has been studied in terms of its levels of chemical contamination, with numerous biomonitoring studies, which makes it necessary to characterise its exposome and its consequences in terms of disease, in order to implement specific corrective measures to minimize the impact on its health. METHODS // A review of scientific literature (MEDLINE and Scopus) was made, according to PRISMA criteria and PICO methodology, to include studies on biomonitoring of pollutants, or evaluating the effect of pollutants on diseases prevalent in the archipelago. RESULTS //Twenty-five studies, both population-based and hospital-based, were selected. The results show that the exposome is made up of at least 110 compounds or elements, 99 of which appear to be present from the intrauterine stage. The presence of chlorinated pollutants and metals stands out, which seems to be related to the high incidence of metabolic diseases (diabetes), cardiovascular diseases (hypertension) and certain types of neoplasms (breast cancer). In short, the consequences are conditioned by the genome of the exposed population, reinforcing the enormous importance of genome-exposome interactions in the development of pathologies.

Omics technologies become increasingly common to identify early biological changes before the apparition of clinical symptoms, to explore toxic mechanisms and to increase biological plausibility of epidemiological associations. This scoping review systematically summarises the application of omics in epidemiological studies assessing EDCs-associated biological effects to identify potential gaps and priorities for future research. Ninety-eight human studies (2004-2021) were identified through database searches (PubMed, Scopus) and citation chaining and focused on phthalates (34 studies), phenols (19) and PFASs (17), while PAHs (12) and recently-used pesticides (3) were less studied. The sample sizes ranged from 10 to 12,476 (median = 159), involving non-pregnant adults (38), pregnant women (11), children/adolescents (15) or both latter populations studied together (23). Several studies included occupational workers (10) and/or highly exposed groups (11) focusing on PAHs, PFASs and pesticides, while studies on phenols and phthalates were performed in the general population only. Analysed omics layers included metabolic profiles (30, including 14 targeted analyses), miRNA (13), gene expression (11), DNA methylation (8), microbiome (5) and proteins (3). Twenty-one studies implemented targeted multi-assays focusing on clinical routine blood lipid traits, oxidative stress or hormones. Overall, DNA methylation and gene expression associations with EDCs did not overlap across studies, while some EDCassociated metabolite groups, such as carnitines, nucleotides and amino acids in untargeted metabolomic studies, and oxidative stress markers in targeted studies, were consistent across studies. Studies had common limitations such as small sample sizes, cross-sectional designs and single sampling for exposure biomonitoring. In conclusion, there is a growing body of evidence evaluating the early biological responses to exposure to EDCs.

The ecological impact and toxicity of this anthropogenic dissolved organic carbon (ADOC) is not related to the presence of a single compound but to the co-occurrence of a myriad of synthetic chemicals with largely unknown effects on heterotrophic microbial communities. We have analyzed the metabolic capacity of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of natural oceanic communities from the north Pacific (Costa Rica dome) and Atlantic oceans challenged with environmentally relevant levels of ADOC. In the Atlantic, ADOC-exposed MAGs responded transcriptionally more strongly compared to controls than in the Pacific, possibly mirroring the higher relevance of ADOC compounds as carbon source in oligotrophic environments. The largest proportions of transcripts originated from MAGs belonging in the families Rhodobacteraceae and Flavobacteriaceae, known to play a role on consumption of several OPs. In the Atlantic, archaeal Poseidoniales showed the highest transcription levels after 2 h of ADOC exposure, although no increase of relative abundances in the DNA pool was recorded after 24 h, whereas Methylophaga showed the opposite pattern. Both taxa are suggested to be actively involved in the consumption of biogenic alkanes produced by cyanobacteria. We observed similar gene expression profiles of alkane degradation and methylotrophy signature genes.

These regions are exposed to the presence of contaminants resulting from human activity (local and global), which, in turn, represent a challenge for life forms in these environments. Anthropogenic pollution by semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in polar ecosystems has been documented since the 1960s. Currently, various studies have shown the presence of SVOCs and their bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the polar regions with negative effects on biodiversity and the ecosystem. Although the production and use of these compounds has been regulated, their persistence continues to threaten biodiversity and the ecosystem. Here, we summarize the current literature regarding microbes and SVOCs in polar regions and pose that bioremediation by native microorganisms is a feasible strategy to mitigate the presence of SVOCs. Our systematic review revealed that microbial communities in polar environments represent a wide reservoir of biodiversity adapted to extreme conditions, found both in terrestrial and aquatic environments, freely or in association with vegetation. Microorganisms adapted to these environments have the potential for biodegradation of SVOCs through a variety of genes encoding enzymes with the capacity to metabolize SVOCs. We suggest that a comprehensive approach at the molecular and ecological level is required to mitigate SVOCs presence in these regions. This is especially patent when considering that SVOCs degrade at slow rates and possess the ability to accumulate in polar ecosystems. The implications of SVOC degradation are relevant for the preservation of polar ecosystems with consequences at a global level.",,,,,"Galbán-Malagón, Cristobal/B-2170-2017; Castro-Nallar, Eduardo/I-5925-2019; Galban Malagon, Cristobal/J-2384-2015","Castro-Nallar, Eduardo/0000-0003-4384-8661; Galban Malagon, Cristobal/0000-0001-8397-5804",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,JUN 25,2023,879,,,,,,,,163046,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163046,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.163046,,MAR 2023,,,,,,36965736,,,,,WOS:000969142100001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, they pose a severe threat to ecosystems and human health due to their easy bioaccumulation and high toxicity. Periphyton is ubiquitous in the submerged substrates surface. It plays a crucial role in carbon, nutrients elements cycling and contaminants transformation in environment. Periphyton can remove OCPs through bioadsorption, bioaccumulation and biodegradation, which alters the fate of OCPs in environment. This review presents a comprehensive summary of OCPs occurrence, global cycle, potential harm in environment, and their removal by periphyton. The OCPs residual have been detected frequently in different environmental medias such as water, soil, atmosphere, sediment, and organisms. Their harm is depending on their physicochemical properties and the exposure route. The main compositions and functions of periphyton have been summarized. Moreover, the artificial cultivation methods of periphyton in laboratory and in-situ field are compared. In addition, the mechanisms of periphyton-mediated OCPs removal and the main factors impacting OCPs removal are also discussed. Periphyton could self-regulate its biological communities to adapt to the OCPs and environment, and then regenerate new species to degrade OCPs. Finally, the prospect of OCPs removal by periphyton and future studies are also proposed.

However, the pathogenic mechanism of PM in poultry houses on respiratory diseases has not been clarified due to its complexity and lack of accurate assays.

Embryos might be particularly exposed through the maternal offloading of contaminants, possibly leading to disruptions during critical developmental phases. Yet, knowledge on biochemical outcomes of prenatal exposure in elasmobranchs is notably limited. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to contaminants in embryos of the critically endangered Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals and per-sonal care products, and metals were determined in embryos. Additionally, glutathione S-transferase activity (GST), glutathione (GSH), and metallothionein levels (MT) were analyzed. Finally, lipid peroxidation levels (LPO) and protein carbonyl groups (PCO) were assessed. Embryonic exposure depended on yolk consumption, which was conspicuous in earlier development. We observed a dilution effect of contaminants levels, potentially related to biotransformation of these compounds throughout the embryonic development. Nevertheless, GST was not correlated to contaminant concentrations. The multivariate relationship between antioxidant components (GSH and GST) and LPO and PCO was negative, suggesting the lack of efficient defense of these biomarkers in early development, leading to oxidative damage. In this context, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to contaminants might impact the redox status in embryos of P. horkelii, leading to oxidative damage.

Moreover, it is difficult to assess the full impact of human exposure to EDCs because adverse effects develop latently and manifest at different ages, even if preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that developing fetus and neonates are most vulnerable to endocrine disruption.Conclusion EDCs represent a major environmental and health issue that has a role in cancer development. There are currently some EDCs that can be considered as carcinogenic, like dioxin and cadmium for breast and thyroid cancer; arsenic, asbestos, and dioxin for prostate cancer; and organochlorines/organohalogens for testicular cancer.

After duplicate removal and screening, only 237 papers were included (corresponding to 268 records). EDCs were grouped from the most frequently (pesticides) to the least frequently studied (salts). The most tumourigenic EDC groups were phthalates (63%), heavy metals (54%), particulate matter (47%), and pesticides (46%). Pesticides group comprised the highest number of retrieved studies (n = 133). Increased neoplasia risk was found in 43-67% of the studies, with a lower value for ovary (43%) and a higher value for thyroid (67%).Conclusions: The innovative nature of our review comes from including human studies of six endocrine-related neoplasia aiming to understand the contribution of specific EDCs groups to each organ's tumourigenesis. Thy-roid was the organ presenting the highest cancer risk after EDC exposure which may explain the increasing thyroid cancer incidence. However, detailed and controlled works reporting the effects of EDCs are scarce, probably justifying conflicting results. Multinational and multicentric human studies with biochemical analysis are needed to achieve stronger and concordant evidence.",,,,,"Soares, Paula/B-6054-2008; Boaventura, Paula/H-8709-2019; Miranda-Alves, Leandro/D-9932-2014","Soares, Paula/0000-0001-9607-6998; Boaventura, Paula/0000-0003-4869-8148; Macedo, Ana Sofia/0000-0001-7752-998X; Miranda-Alves, Leandro/0000-0001-7832-8717; Teixeira, Elisabete/0000-0002-2133-6369; Bordeira Gaspar, Tiago/0000-0002-7410-7869",,,,,,,,,,,,,0013-9351,1096-0953,,,,FEB 1,2023,218,,,,,,,,114869,10.1016/j.envres.2022.114869,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.envres.2022.114869,,DEC 2022,,,,,,36460069,,,,,WOS:000921379800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

The project aims to provide urban planners with information on the remediation of vacant lands using urban runoff pollutant removal techniques. To find the most effective removal method, relevant scholarly papers and case studies are reviewed to see what types of vacant land have many urban runoff pollutants and how to effectively remove contaminants from stormwater runoff in the city by SCMs. The results show that previously developed/used land (but now vacant) has been identified as contaminated sites, including prior residential, commercial, industrial, and parking lot land use from urban areas. SCMs are effective management approaches to reduce nonpoint source pollution problems runoff. It is an umbrella concept that can be used to capture nature-based, cost-effective, and eco-friendly treatment technologies and redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive, economically viable, and with good public acceptance. Among these removal techniques, a bioretention system tends to be effective for removing dissolved and particulate components of heavy metals and phosphorus. Using different plant species and increasing filter media depth has identified the effectiveness of eliminating nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). A medium with a high hydraulic conductivity covers an existing medium with low hydraulic conductivity, and the result will be a higher and more effective decrease for phosphorus (P) pollutants. In addition, wet ponds were found to be highly effective at removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with removal rates as high as 99%. For the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) pollutants, despite the implementation of SCMs in urban areas to remove PFAAs and particulate-related contaminants in stormwater runoff, the current literature has little information on SCMs' removal of PFAAs. Studies have also found that VUL's size, shape, and connectivity are significantly inversely correlated with the reduction in stormwater runoff. This paper will help planners and landscape designers make efficient decisions around removing pollutants from VUL stormwater runoff, leading to better use of these spaces.",,,,,,"Wang, Yang/0000-0001-7743-6089",,,,,,,,,,,,,,2071-1050,,,,OCT,2022,14,19,,,,,,,12906,10.3390/su141912906,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/su141912906,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000867189000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Early life (from pregnancy through childhood) is a vulnerable window for exposure. Therefore, interventions in low-and middle-income countries to prevent or reduce early life exposure to cadmium may be relevant for improving public health.Methods We systematically reviewed five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Global Health Medicus, Greenfile, and PubMed). Synthesis without meta -analy-sis (narrative synthesis) was used for data analysis due to the wide heterogeneity of included studies. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using modified GRADE criteria. Results 4098 articles were returned by the search and a total of 26 studies from 21 LMICs were included in this review, ranging from policies to clinical treat-ment, rehabilitation and clean-up methods for agricultural soil, interventions for nutrition and cooking, and anti-pollution strategies at the household level. The interventions targeted children, pregnant and postpartum women, and/or women of childbearing age. While several studies provided some evidence of ef-fectiveness, none appeared to offer a realistic solution for cadmium pollution at scale. Agricultural and food preparation studies were relatively frequent, partic-ularly related to rice. Studies on air filtration during pregnancy indicated some effectiveness in reducing indoor cadmium exposures.Conclusions Cadmium pollution is a persistent and widespread threat to chil-dren's health with few identified solutions.

Faced with the potentially harmful effects of ECs on humans, regulatory agencies around the world require the integration of epidemiological, in vivo toxicological, and in vitro mechanistic data to provide the necessary information for hazard classification, labeling, and risk management of chemicals. However, animal studies have time-consuming and high-cost defects and ethical problems. High-throughput in vitro assays are also unable to provide systematic toxicological information for chemical hazard classification for over 100000 chemicals in commerce. Recently, computing resources and artificial intelligence have innovatively improved the accuracy and speed of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the structural biology and deep learning (DL) algorithms (e.g., AlphaFold2 and AF2Complex) have incrementally resolved a large number of biomolecular crystal structures. Thus, the use of computational toxicology techniques in environmental toxicology has increased significantly. It is estimated that computational toxicology techniques can perform virtual screening of millions of compounds in a limited amount of time for the contaminant-biomolecule interaction process. Thus, computational toxicology techniques can reduce the initial experimental cost of identifying environmental emerging contaminants, increase information on the toxicity mechanisms of ECs, and improve the efficiency of hazard identification of ECs by regulatory authorities. This study systematically reviews computational toxicology techniques commonly used to analyze ECs-biomolecule interactions, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and machine learning-based modelling. Molecular docking is a well-established molecular simulation method that explores the interactions between biomolecules and small molecules to predict their binding modes and binding affinities. MD can simulate the flexible binding process of contaminant-biomolecule and the dynamic conformational shift process of contaminant-biomolecule complexes, providing more comprehensive information on the interaction mechanism. Machine learning-based modelling is a novel computational toxicology technique that is completely different from molecular simulation. It mainly uses publicly available structural information and in chemico, in vitro, and in vivo bioactivity data to construct (quantitative) structure-activity relationships (Q)SARs based on ML algorithms, and uses (Q)SAR models to rapidly improve the efficiency of virtual screening of ECs targeted at biomolecules, and further deepen the analysis of contaminant-biomolecule interaction mechanisms in complex biological contexts. In this paper, the main applications of these techniques in the field of environmental toxicology in recent years are systematically reviewed, including the mechanistic studies of contaminant-biomolecule interactions and high-throughput virtual screening. The advantages and limitations of these techniques in terms of ligand-receptor interaction, explainability, training efficiency, computational depth, and biological processes are discussed. Results showed that MD simulations, which can deeply explore contaminant-biomolecule interactions, are unable to achieve the high-throughput virtual screening of ECs. Machine learning-based modelling, which can reflect the complex biological processes and achieve high accuracy prediction, unable to effectively interpret the prediction results due to the 'black box' defects. Molecular docking, which has the potential to be a high throughput virtual screening method, is limited by local sampling and approximate scoring function deficiencies. These problems limit the ability of molecular docking to analyze more comprehensive mechanisms of ECs-biomolecule interactions. Therefore, only the combination of multiple computational toxicology techniques to develop an integrated workflow for mechanistic analysis and virtual screening can compensate for their respective shortcomings and obtain optimal results. However, how to increase the computational throughput screening while maintaining the mechanism analysis remains a key issue to be addressed in the future.",,,,,"zhang, xiaowei/GQH-5387-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,0023-074X,2095-9419,,,,,2022,67,35,,,,,4180,4191,,10.1360/TB-2022-0613,http://dx.doi.org/10.1360/TB-2022-0613,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000899164300012,View Full Record in Web of Science

Although avian colouration plays many functions, including concealment, thermoregulation, or advertisement as a distasteful prey, a quality-signalling role in sexual selection has attracted most research attention. Sexually selected ornaments are thought to be more susceptible to external stressors than naturally selected traits, and as such, they might be used as a test for environmental quality. For this reason, the last two decades have seen numerous studies on the impact of anthropogenic pollution on the expression of various avian colour traits. Herein, we provide the first meta-analytical summary of these results and examine whether there is an interaction between the mechanism of colour production (carotenoid-based, melanin-based and structural) and the type of anthropogenic factor (categorised as heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, urbanisation, or other). Following the assumption of heightened condition dependence of ornaments under sexual selection, we also expected the magnitude of effect sizes to be higher in males. The overall effect size was close to significance and negative, supporting a general detrimental impact of anthropogenic pollutants on avian colouration. In contrast to expectations, there was no interaction between pollution types and colour-producing mechanisms. Yet there were significant differences in sensitivity between colour-producing mechanisms, with carotenoid-based colouration being the most affected by anthropogenic environmental disturbances. Moreover, we observed no significant tendency towards heightened sensitivity in males. We identified a publication gap on structural colouration, which, compared to pigment-based colouration, remains markedly understudied and should thus be prioritised in future research. Finally, we call for the unification of methods used in colour quantification in ecological research to ensure comparability of results among studies.",,,,,"Janas, Katarzyna/HJO-9787-2023; Drobniak, Szymon/K-4954-2015","Janas, Katarzyna/0000-0002-0646-2543; Drobniak, Szymon/0000-0001-8101-6247",,,,,,,,,,,,,1464-7931,1469-185X,,,,2024 MAR 17,2024,,,,,,,,,,10.1111/brv.13067,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/brv.13067,,MAR 2024,,,,,,38494176,,,,,WOS:001185920300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Fish is an essential source of protein for humans, playing a crucial role in daily food intake. Until recently, MPs were addressed primarily as environmental pollutants, but they are now increasingly recognized as contaminants in the food supply. The present review has comprehended the current knowledge of MP contamination in freshwater and marine fishes of Asia, including 112 peer-reviewed sources from 2016 to 2023. The review recorded 422 Asian fishes (345 marine and 77 freshwater) to be contaminated with MPs. Clarias gariepinus and Selaroides leptolepi have shown maximum MP contamination in the freshwater and marine environments of Asia, respectively. Omnivorous and carnivorous fishes exhibited higher susceptibility to ingesting MPs. Benthopelagic, demersal, and reef-associated habitats were identified as more prone to MP accumulation. In both freshwater and marine environments, China has the highest number of contaminated species among all the countries. Pollution indices indicated high MP contamination in both freshwater and marine environments. A prevalence of fibers was recorded in all fishes. Black- and blue-colored MPs of <500 mu m-1 mm size were found dominantly. Polyethylene terephthalate and polyethylene were recorded as the prevalent plastic polymers in freshwater and marine fish, respectively. Overall, the review served as a comprehensive understanding of MP concentrations and variations between species, between feeding habits, and between geographic locations, which can be pivotal for addressing pressing environmental challenges, protecting human health, and fostering global sustainability efforts in the face of escalating plastic pollution.

Direct chalcogenation of C-H bonds has evolved as a step- and atom-economical method for the synthesis of chalcogen-bearing compounds. Nevertheless, direct C-H chalcogenation severely lags behind C-C, C-N and C-O bond formations. Moreover, compared with the C-H monochalcogenation, reports of selective mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive dichalcogenation of C-H bonds are relatively scarce. The past decade has witnessed significant advancements in selective mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive dichalcogenation of various C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(3))-H bonds via transition-metal-catalyzed/mediated, photocatalytic, electrochemical or metal-free approaches. In light of the significance of both mono- and dichalcogen-containing compounds in various fields of chemical science and the critical issue of chemoselectivity in organic synthesis, the present review systematically summarizes the advances in these research fields, with a special focus on elucidating scopes and mechanistic aspects. Moreover, the synthetic limitations, applications of some of these processes, the current challenges and our own perspectives on these highly active research fields are also discussed. Based on the substrate types and C-H bonds being chalcogenated, the present review is organized into four sections: (1) transition-metal-catalyzed/mediated chelation-assisted selective C-H mono-/dichalcogenation or exclusive dichalcogenation of (hetero)arenes; (2) directing group-free selective C-H mono-/dichalcogenation or exclusive dichalcogenation of electron-rich (hetero)arenes; (3) C(sp(3))-H dichalcogenation; (4) dichalcogenation of both C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(3))-H bonds.

It is regularly transported from developed to developing nations, where it is disassembled informally in search of precious metals, thus increasing human exposure to harmful compounds. Africa has a serious problem with e-waste, as there are significant facilities in Ghana and Nigeria where imported e-waste is unsafely dismantled. however, because they are in high demand and less expensive than new ones, old electronic and electrical items are imported in large quantities, just like in many developing nations. After that, these objects are frequently scavenged to recover important metals through heating, burning, incubation in acids, and other techniques. Serious health hazards are associated with these activities for workers and individuals close to recycling plants. At e-waste sites in Africa, there have been documented instances of elevated concentrations of hazardous elements, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy metals in dust, soils, and vegetation, including plants consumed as food. Individuals who handle and dispose of e-waste are exposed to highly hazardous chemical substances. This paper examines heavy metal risks around e-waste sites and comparable municipal dumpsites in major African cities. Elevated concentrations of these heavy metals metal in downstream aquatic and marine habitats have resulted in additional environmental impacts. These effects have been associated with unfavourable outcomes in marine ecosystems, such as reduced fish stocks characterized by smaller sizes, increased susceptibility to illness, and decreased population densities. The evidence from the examined studies shows how much e-waste affects human health and the environment in Africa.

The analysis was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, revealing notable concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cd, and Zn, with average levels of 6.85, 156.77, 0.41, and 3.37 mg/kg, respectively.Assessment of target hazard quotients for Pb, against recommended benchmark doses of observable effects, indicated levels 2 to 6 times higher than the recommended safety thresholds. The cumulative totals of target hazard quotients across multiple specimens exceeded 2 and, in some cases, reached up to 7, surpassing the safety cutoff of 1. The risk of cancer from Ni and Pb was calculated to be 1 in 10,000 on average for each, classifying it as a moderate risk. Quantitative analysis revealed that heavy metal concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cd, and Zn in most fish samples exceeded reference safety values. Simultaneously, hazard analysis identified critical concerns regarding Pb content in one sample, and cumulative toxin loads in almost every sample were deemed unsafe for regular consumption. In addition to quantitative assessments, a qualitative survey employed observation techniques, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews to investigate consumption behaviors and viewpoints on fish contamination.

The pathogenesis of endometriosis has been attributed to factors like genetics, environmental particles, and hormones. A comprehensive review of studies from July 2010 to July 2023 across multiple databases was done to aid in a better understanding of the same. The investigation focused on studies delineating the correlation between endocrine disruptors, microRNAs, and endometriosis. To optimize the search scope, keywords and subject headings were used as search terms. Then, two authors rigorously assessed studies using criteria, selecting 27 studies from various databases. Notably, dioxins, organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls exhibited a solid connection for endometriosis, while bisphenol A and phthalates yielded conflicting results. The heightened presence of bisphenol A, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalates was linked to altered gene expression, including genes like AKR1B10, AKR1C3, and FAM49B. MicroRNAs like miRNA-31, miRNA-144, and miRNA-145 emerged as vital factors in the onset of endometriosis and progression. Furthermore, elevated expression of miR-1304-3p, miR-544, and miR-3684 and reduced expression of miR-3935 and miR-4427 exert substantial influence on signaling pathways like NF-kappa B, MAPK, and Wnt/beta-catenin. Currently, literature shows an independent link between endocrine disruptor exposure and endometriosis and between microRNA dysregulation and endometriosis.

Autochthonous microorganisms in dumpsites exhibit various degrees of responses to contaminants. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of information on the types and concentration of pollutants and the array of microorganisms in these dumpsites which may play important roles in the metabolism of such pollutants or other community processes. Therefore, determining the microbial community structure in such contaminated sites across a municipality is essential for profiling the taxa that would serve as consensus degraders of the pollutants. In this study, soil samples from three dumpsites (Cele, CS; Solous, SS; and Computer Village, CVS) were characterized for geochemical properties using GC-MS, MP-AES, and other analytical protocols, while the dynamics of bacterial communities were evaluated based on their 16S rRNA gene barcodes. A significant difference in the bacterial communities was observed among the dumpsites in relation to the extent of pollution caused by POPs and HMs. CVS, with the highest HM contamination, was rich in Actinobacteria (41.7%) and Acidobacteria (10.2%), in contrast to CS and SS. Proteobacteria (34.1%) and Firmicutes (20%) were the dominant phyla in CS (highest POP contamination), while Bacteroidetes (45.5%) and Proteobacteria (39.9%) were dominant in SS soil. Bacillus was the dominant genus in the most polluted dumpsite. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and HMs shaped the structure of the bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the most polluted dumpsite. Out of a total of 706 OTUs, 628 OTUs exhibited a significant correlation (>50%) with benzo(b)fluoranthene, azobenzene, dibenzofurans, pyrene, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene, Cu, and Zn. In particular, Proteobacteria (Achromobacter sp. and Serratia sp.), Bacteroidetes (Zhouia sp.), and Firmicutes (Bacillus sp.) were suggested to be pivotal to the ecophysiology of dumpsite soils contaminated with POPs and HMs. The results generally underscored the importance of metagenomic and physicochemical analyses of polluted systems in enabling correlations for useful prediction of drivers of such ecosystems.

This research investigated the estrogens pollution levels in six mangroves located in the Southern China. The estrogen levels were found to be in the range of 5.3-24.9 ng/g dry weight, suggesting that these mangroves had been seriously contaminated. The bacterial communities under estrogen stress were further enriched by supplementing 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as the sole carbon source. The enriched bacterial communities showed an excellent E2 degradation capacity > 95 %. These communities were able to transform E2 into estrone (E1), 4-hydroxy-estrone, and keto-estrone, etc. 16 S rDNA sequencing and metagenomics analysis revealed that bacterial taxa Oleiagrimonas, Pseudomonas, Terrimonas, and Nitratireductor etc. were the main contributors to estrogen degradation. Moreover, the genes involved in E2 degradation were enriched in the microbial communities, including the genes encoding 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, estrone 4-hydroxylase, etc. Finally, the analyses of functional genes and binning genomes demonstrated that E2 was degraded by bacterial communities via dehydrogenation into E1 by 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. E1 was then catabolically converted to 3a alpha-H- 4 alpha(3'-propanoate)-7a beta-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione via 4,5-seco pathway.

Two-hundred and seven studies were used for analyses to determine the spatial and temporal trends of FR exposure. North America consistently had the highest concentrations of PBDEs, while Asia and Oceania dominated HBCDD exposure. BDE-49 and -99 indicated decreasing temporal trends in most regions. BDE-153, with a longer half-life than the aforementioned isomers, typically exhibited a plateau in breast milk levels. No conclusive trend could be established for HBCDD, and insufficient information was available to determine a temporal trend for BDE-209. Breakpoint analyses indicated a significant decrease in BDE-47 and -99 in Europe around the time that regulation has been implemented, suggesting a positive effect of regulation on FR exposure. However, very few studies have been conducted globally (specifically in North America) after 2013, during the time when the most recent regulations have been implemented.

To investigate the effect of increasing manganese accessibility on microbial nitrogen cycle, Mn-HA (Manganese-Humus chelates), a naturally occurring compound in the form of organochelate, was introduced into the conventional nitrification-denitrification process. The findings revealed that the addition of Mn-HA significantly facilitated the removal of ammonium and nitrate potentially by Mnammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation mediated by Mn (IV)-oxide reduction) and Mn-based autotrophic denitrification. Metagenomic analyses suggested the presence of manganese-redox microorganisms involved in nitrification and denitrification, indicating the occurrence of manganese redox-coupled nitrogen metabolism processes. Additionally, the production and consumption of bio-MnOx (bio-Manganese Oxides) were observed in conjunction with denitrification and nitrification. The production of unequal amounts of bio-MnOx suggested that bio-MnOx may have been deposited in the sediment. This was confirmed by the BCR sequential extraction experiment. Coupling Mn metabolism with N metabolism is an adaptive strategy for nitrogen metabolizing microorganisms. For Mn-sensitive populations, they gain respite from Mn-rich environments by adopting strategies such as manganese oxidation, regulating manganese transport, pumping out intracellular manganese and evolving other manganese resistance genes.",,,,,"Cao, Xin/L-7110-2019","Cao, Xin/0000-0003-1722-023X",,,,,,,,,,,,,0959-6526,1879-1786,,,,DEC 10,2023,430,,,,,,,,139666,10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139666,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2023.139666,,NOV 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001121159000001,View Full Record in Web of Science

HRAS, IFNG, CAT, CDH1, FASN, ACLY, CCL5, VCAM1, SCD and HMGCR were the key host factors related to ACE2. Tissue-specific enrichment and correlation analysis with ACE2 showed that SCD, CAT and FASN were highly expressed in the lung; and these 10 molecules were closely related to ACE2 and specifically expressed in multiple tissues. We also identified a series of drugs, such as estradiol, tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, resveratrol, cyclosporine, perfluorooctanoic acid and so on. Finally, the expression levels and diagnostic performance of HRAS and SCD showed statistical significance in external databases. This study explored the interaction networks of ACE2related host factors in COVID-19 and asthma and identified several potential drugs for COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity. Although our research needs further verification, it still informs the mechanisms and treatment of COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity.",,,,,,/0000-0002-2892-7145,,,,,,,,,,,,,1746-8094,1746-8108,,,,JAN,2024,87,,B,,,,,,105502,10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105502,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2023.105502,,OCT 2023,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001087056300001,View Full Record in Web of Science

All Technosols improved the unfavourable conditions of polluted soils by neutralising acidity, increasing the OC, reducing the mobility of most metal(loid)s, and stimulating both the soil enzymatic activities and growths of T. campestre and L. sativa. The origin of organic waste used in the Technosols strongly conditioned the changes induced in the polluted soils; in this sense, the Technosols composed of pruning and gardening vermicompost (T3 and T6) showed greater reductions in toxicity and plant growth than the other Technosols composed with different organic wastes.

Metabolome-wide association studies were performed for PBB-153 separately for each generation and Sigma PCB (PCB-118, PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-180) in the two generations combined, as both had direct PCB exposure. Metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations were evaluated following a well-established untargeted HRM workflow.Results: Mean levels were 1.75 ng/mL [standard deviation (SD): 13.9] for PBB-153 and 1.04 ng/mL (SD: 0.788) for Sigma PCB. Sixty-two and 26 metabolic features were significantly associated with PBB-153 in F0 and F1 [false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.2], respectively. There were 2,861 features associated with Sigma PCB (FDR p<0.2). Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis using a bioinformatics tool revealed perturbations associated with Sigma PCB in numerous oxidative stress and inflammation pathways (e.g., carnitine shuttle, glycosphingolipid, and vitamin B9 metabolism). Metabolic perturbations associated with PBB-153 in F0 were related to oxidative stress (e.g., pentose phosphate and vitamin C metabolism) and in F1 were related to energy production (e.g., pyrimidine, amino sugars, and lysine metabolism). Using authentic chemical standards, we confirmed the chemical identity of 29 metabolites associated with Sigma PCB levels (level 1 evidence).Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that serum PBB-153 is associated with alterations in inflammation and oxidative stress-related pathways, which differed when stratified by generation. We also found that Sigma PCB was associated with the downregulation of important neurotransmitters, serotonin, and 4-aminobutanoate.

However, our understanding of the associations among rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microorganisms, and POPs degradation in different plant growth stages is limited. We combined stable-isotope probing (SIP), high-throughput sequencing, and metabolomics to analyze changes in rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microbes, and BaP biodegradation in the early growth stages (tillering, jointing) and later stage (booting) of ryegrass. Microbial community structures differed significantly among growth stages. Metabolisms such as benzenoids and carboxylic acids tended to be enriched in the early growth stage, while lipids and organic heterocyclic compounds dominated in the later stage. From SIP, eight BaP-degrading microbes were identified, and most of which such as Ilumatobacter and Singulisphaera were first linked with BaP biodegradation. Notably, the relationship between the differential metabolites and BaP degra-dation efficiency further suggested that BaP-degrading microbes might metabolize BaP directly to produce benzenoid metabolites (3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene), or utilize benzenoids (phyllodulcin) to stimulate the co-metabolism of BaP in early growth stage; some lipids and organic acids, e.g. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, might provide nutrients for the degraders to promote BaP metabolism in later stage. Accordingly, we determined that certain rhizospheric metabolites might regulate the rhizospheric microbial communities at different growth stages, and shift the composition and diversity of BaP-degrading bacteria, thereby enhancing in situ BaP degradation.

Challenged by the extreme conditions of high-altitude environments, the strategies implemented by highland animals to adjust their diet and gut microbial composition and modulate their metabolic substrates remain largely unexplored. By employing a typical human commensal species, the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus, ETS), as a model species, we studied the differences in diet, digestive tract morphology and enzyme activity, gut microbiota, and metabolic energy profiling between highland (the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, QTP; 3230 m) and lowland (Shijiazhuang, Hebei; 80 m) populations. Our results showed that highland ETSs had enlarged digestive organs and longer small intestinal villi, while no differences in key digestive enzyme activities were observed between the two populations. The 18S rRNA sequencing results revealed that the dietary composition of highland ETSs were more animal-based and less plant-based than those of the lowland ones. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing results suggested that the intestinal microbial com-munities were structurally segregated between populations. PICRUSt metagenome predictions further indicatedthat the expression patterns of microbial genes involved in material and energy metabolism, immune system and infection, and xenobiotic biodegradation were strikingly different between the two populations. Analysis of liver metabolomics revealed significant metabolic differences between highland and lowland ETSs in terms of sub-strate utilization, as well as distinct sex-specific alterations in glycerophospholipids. Furthermore, the interplay between diet, liver metabolism, and gut microbiota suggests a dietary shift resulting in corresponding changes in gut microbiota and metabolic functions. Our findings indicate that highland ETSs have evolved to optimize digestion and absorption, rely on more protein-rich foods, and possess gut microbiota tailored to their dietary composition, likely adaptive physiological and ecological strategies adopted to cope with extreme highland environments.",,,,,,"Li, Dongming/0000-0003-2759-3435",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,DEC 20,2023,905,,,,,,,,167079,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167079,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167079,,SEP 2023,,,,,,37714349,,,,,WOS:001083140500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

So, this study aimed to investigate the PTEs concentration in the environment. In this cross-sectional study, Ahvaz city, the capital city of Khuzestan province, was divided into 5 areas. At each site, three-date palms were selected. Leaves and mesh fibers samples were collected from the young palm (3 years) with a maximum trunk height of 3-4 m. Plant leaves samples were separated from the middle section of the main leaves area of the plant and mesh fibers were selected from the different parts of the palm data trunk (top, middle, and bottom of the palm data trunk on all four sides of the palm). Then, data palm samples were divided into two groups of washed/unwashed. Soil samples were collected from the closest point to the palms date at a depth of 0-50 cm including at two depths (0-20 cm and 20-40 cm), and then combined to make a composite soil sample. After the preparation of samples, PTEs were measured by ICP-OES. The highest PTEs concentrations were found in industrial and high-traffic sites and the lowest was obtained at the control site. The largest bioconcentration factor (BCF) was related to copper (2.34-7.49) in mesh fibers samples and in the leaves (1.65) in the control area. Principal component analysis (PCA) results showed metal(loid)s (copper, nickel, zinc, lead, iron, arsenic, and cobalt) are mostly related to brake wear and tire of vehicles and asphalt and road dust, while the metals (Manganese, chromium, and cadmium) mostly originate from industrial sources.

Male donor mice were injected with a mixture of 10 POPs at concentrations of 0 x and 5 x lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL). Their adipose tissue (AT) containing the POP was then grafted onto the host mice and the metabolic change of the host mice was monitored for 3 or 21 days.

For the host mice engrafted with POP-containing fat pad, there was dysregulation of the fatty acids and glycerides observed in all the organs studied 3 days after the graft. However, there was no longer a significant change in the metabolites 21 days after the graft. The difference in significant values and metabolite regulation in each of the skeletal muscles showed that the POP mixture affects different types of skeletal muscle in a heterogeneous manner. Fold change analysis showed that certain metabolites in the kidney of host mice exposed to POPs for 3 days were greatly affected. Using multivariate analysis, apart from the plantaris, most treated groups exposed to POPs for 3 days are well distinguished from the control groups. However, for host mice exposed to POPs for 21 days, apart from the kidney and heart, groups are not well-distinguished from the control group.

Unraveling the phytotoxic mechanisms of POPs in crops is critical for evaluating their environmental risks. Herein, the molecular mechanism of POP-induced phytotoxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was analyzed using metabolic profile, enzyme activity, and gene expression as linkages, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalate esters. Despite no observable changes in phenotypic traits (e.g., biomass and length of aboveground), the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were promoted under stresses of the tested POPs, particularly 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Metabolomics analysis revealed that ROS contents positively correlated with metabolic perturbation levels (r = 0.83), among which the galactose metabolism was significantly inhibited when exposed to DBP, DEHP, or BDE-47. The a-Galactosidase (a-Gal) involved in galactose metabolism was targeted as the key enzyme for the phytotoxicity of DBP, DEHP, and BDE-47, which was revealed by the inhibition of saccharide levels (45.5-82.1%), the catalytic activity of a-Gal (18.5-24.3%), and the gene expression (28.5-34.5%). Molecular docking simulation suggested that the three POPs occupied the active sites of a-Gal and formed a stable protein-ligand complex, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of a-Gal. Partial least-squares regression analysis indicated that a-Gal activity was negatively associated with hydrogen bond acceptor, rotatable bond, and topological polar surface area of POPs.

Therefore, it is important to summarize the main findings of previous studies on DP in human tissues and to provide potential guidance for future studies. In this paper, DP levels in different populations and human tissues worldwide since 2009 were systematically reviewed. DP levels in human tissues of workers in e-waste dismantling sites in Guangdong Province, China (median 190 ng center dot g (-1) lw in serum) and DP manufacturing plants in Jiangsu Province, China (mean 857 ng center dot g (-1) lw in whole-blood) are the highest reported worldwide. DP levels in tissues of the general population in recent studies are close to those of residents near ewaste dismantling sites, which should be of concern. DP levels in different human tissues were found to be positively correlated with a pattern of blood > breast milk > adipose tissue. The distribution of DP in different human tissues is mainly lipid-driven and may also be influenced by the interaction of DP with proteins such as human serum albumin. Most of the past studies determined the isomer stereoselectivity of DP in human tissuesonly by comparing the composition of DP in commercial DP products and human tissues, which lacks evidence of mechanism. Recently, a significantly different affinity of DP isomers for proteins was found, which seems to confirm the isomer selectivity of DP in human tissues. We simulated the binding of DP to human serum albumin and DP to thyroid hormone receptor ss by molecular docking and found differences in the binding behavior of synDP and anti-DP to the selected proteins. Molecular docking seems to be a feasible approach for future studies to predict and reveal the mechanisms of DP behavior and health effects in human tissues.",,,,,"li, yingxia/AAO-6263-2020; Bao, Junsong/HJI-4246-2023","Bao, Junsong/0000-0002-6141-9628",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,DEC 10,2023,903,,,,,,,,166156,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166156,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166156,,AUG 2023,,,,,,37572901,,,,,WOS:001065854200001,View Full Record in Web of Science

Some studies have shown that the coexistence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microplastics (MPs) promotes the adsorption of heavy metal cations, but the mechanism of promoting the adsorption process has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, the effect of polystyrene microplastics (PSMPs) on the binding properties of Pb2+ onto humic acid (HA) in aquatic environments was investigated by spectral analysis and two-dimensional correlation (2D-COS) analysis. When PSMPs co-existed with HA, the adsorption capacity of Pb2+ increased. On the one hand, Pb2+ is directly adsorbed on HA through the mechanism of complexation reaction, ion exchange and electrostatic interaction. On the other hand, Pb2+ is first adsorbed on PSMPs by electrostatic action and indirectly adsorbed on HA in the form of PSMPs-Pb2+ owing to the interaction between HA and PSMPs, which increases the adsorption amount of Pb2+ on HA.

The metabolomics analysis showed indole-5-carbonitrile 3-benzoyl (C16H10N2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (C2H6OS), deoxyguanosine (C10H13N5O4), Leu (C6H13NO2), and N-nitroso-pyrrolidine were indole-degradated metabolites formed by A. towneri NTA1-2A while neurine (C5H13NO) and norvaline (C5H11NO2) are common metabolites of both strains. The two strains' degradation metabolites differed from those reported in other studies, demonstrating the diversity of the distinct microbial strains approach to the metabolism of indolic compounds. Extracellular enzymes released to culture medium by these bacteria were also identified. In conclusion, the two bacterial strains have a potential of converting notorious indole compound to non-toxic intermediates mediated by enzymes. Hence, future study should focus on biochemical pathway and genetic basis for indole-degradated metabolites in the two strains.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0003-6838,1608-3024,,,,AUG,2023,59,4,,,,,462,467,,10.1134/S0003683823040154,http://dx.doi.org/10.1134/S0003683823040154,,,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:001049277000007,View Full Record in Web of Science

Many studies have summarized the observed and potential environmental impacts associated with COVID-19, however, only a few have quantified and compared the effects of these unintended environmental impacts; moreover, whether COVID-19 policy stringency had the same effects on the main environmental topic (i.e., CO2 emissions) across the 3 years remains unclear. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of the recent literature and analyzed the main findings. We found that the positive environmental effects of COVID-19 have received more attention than the negative ones (50.6 % versus 35.7 %), especially in emissions reduction (34 % of total literature). Medical waste (14.5 %) received the highest attention among the negative impacts. Although global emission reduction, especially in terms of CO2, has received significant attention, the positive impacts were temporary and only detected in 2020. Strict COVID-19 policies had a more profound and significant effect on CO2 emissions in the aviation sector than in the power and industry sectors. For example, compared with 2019, international aviation related CO2 emissions dropped by 59 %, 49 %, and 25 % in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, while industry related ones dropped by only 3.16 % in 2020. According to our developed evaluation matrix, medical wastes and their associated effects, including the persistent pollution caused by antibiotic resistance genes, heavy metals and microplastics, are the main challenges post the pandemic, especially in China and India, which may counteract the temporary environmental benefits of COVID-19. Overall, the presented results demonstrate methods to quantify the environmental effects of COVID-19 and provide directions for policymakers to develop measures to address the associated environmental issues in the post-COVID-19 world.",,,,,,"Hernandez-Rodriguez, Enrique/0000-0001-8339-5826",,,,,,,,,,,,,0048-9697,1879-1026,,,,NOV 15,2023,899,,,,,,,,165581,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165581,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165581,,JUL 2023,,,,,,37482347,,,,,WOS:001050671500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

It was found by isothermal titration calorimetry that the metabolites and HSA spontaneously combined mainly through hydrogen bond and van der Waals interaction. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and circular dichroism spectra showed that the metabolites caused slight changes in the microenvironment and conformation of HSA. The above results were proved by molecular docking. The toxicity properties of the metabolites were further analyzed by software, and 4-F-3-PBA was found to be more toxic than 3-PBA.

The environmental risk of COPs was usually underestimated by the existing evaluation methods, such as without the consideration of the non-extractable residues (NER) and the multi-process coupling effect. Especially, the synergetic coupling asso-ciations between dechlorination and methanogenesis might increase the risk of methane emission that has barely been previously considered in previous risk assessment approaches.

These hazardous compounds include persistent organic pollutants (POPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals. This review searched papers addressing hazardous compounds emitted from e-waste recycling activities and their health effects in Vietnam. Based on the keywords searched in three electronic databases (PubMed, Psych Info, and Google scholar), we found 21 relevant studies in Vietnam. The review identifies extensive e-waste dismantling activities in Vietnam in the northern region. To measure the environmental exposure to hazardous compounds, samples such as e-waste recycling workshop dust, soil, air, and sediments were assessed, while human exposure levels were measured using participants' hair, serum, or breast milk samples. Studies that compared levels of exposure in e-waste recycling sites and reference sites indicated higher levels of PBDEs, PCBs, and heavy metals were observed in both environmental and human samples from participants in e-waste recycling sites. Among environmental samples, hazardous chemicals were the most detected in dust from e-waste recycling sites. Considering both environmental and human samples, the highest exposure difference observed with PBDE ranged from 2-48-fold higher in e-waste processing sites than in the reference sites. PCBs showed nearly 3-fold higher levels in e-waste processing sites than in reference sites. In the e-waste processing sites, age-specific higher PCB levels were observed in older recycler's serum samples. Among the heavy metals, Pb was highly detected in drinking water, indoor soil and human blood samples. While high detection of Ni in cooked rice, Mn in soil and diet, Zn in dust and As in urine were apparent. Exposure assessment from human biomonitoring showed participants, including children and mothers from the e-waste processing areas, had higher carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks than the reference sites.

Consumers state that foods labeled as organic are nutritionally superior and safer than their conventionally produced equivalent. The research question for this systematic review is as follows: is there a difference between the effects of sustainable agriculture and conventional farming methods on rice grain end-use quality, healthfulness, and safety? The studies (n = 23) examined for this review suggest that organic production practices don't influence most end-use quality (e.g., chalk, milling yield, pasting properties) and healthfulness (e.g., gamma-oryzanol fraction and tocols) traits studied, or if it does, it will be to a small degree. If differences in end-use quality traits are found, they will be associated with grain protein content, which varies along with the dose of nitrogen applied during rice growth. We conclude that the studies evaluated in this review found that organically produced rice grain was less likely to contain residues of the pesticides (e.g., organochlorine) examined in the study than the rice is grown using conventional methods. There was some evidence that organically grown rice is more likely to be contaminated with mycotoxin-producing fungi and some mycotoxins. Common shortcomings of the studies were that they were poorly designed, with limited to no details of the cultural management practices used to grow the rice studied, the length of time fields was under organic management not stated, cultivars were not named, and the data wasn't analyzed statistically.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2304-8158,,,,JAN,2023,12,1,,,,,,,73,10.3390/foods12010073,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/foods12010073,,,,,,,,36613289,,,,,WOS:000909299500001,View Full Record in Web of Science

However, the impact of Flu on complicated biochemical processes involving functional microbial community has been reported rarely. In this study, the facilitation of Flu on the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) generation executed by acidogenic microbial population during sludge acidogenic fermentation (37 degrees C, SRT = 8 d, pH = 10.0) was investigated. The accumulation of VFAs (particularly acetic acid) increased initially and then declined with the increasing of Flu concentration (0-500 mg/kg dry sludge), which reached a maximum (3211.1 mg COD/L) as Flu content was 200 mg/kg dry sludge. The Fluenhanced VFAs production was primarily attributed to the shift of hydrolysis/acidification, as well as the corresponding functional microbial community and the activity of enzymes. Based on the metagenomics analysis, the conversion of organic substrates, i.e. amino acid and monosaccharide, into VFAs embraced in hydrolysis/acidification shaped by Flu was constructed at the genetic level. The relative abundances of genes included in aminotransfer and deamination process of amino acid and glycolysis of monosaccharide into VFA-precursors (pyruvate, acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA), and the further formation of VFAs were improved due to the Flu presence.

When MPs/NPs enter different organisms, they transport various pollutants, including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, drugs, bacteria, and viruses, from the environment. On this basis, this paper summarizes the combined toxicity induced by MPs/NPs accumulating contaminants from the environment and entering organisms through a systematic review of 162 articles. Moreover, the factors influ-encing toxic interactions are critically discussed, thus highlighting the dominant role of the relative concen-trations of contaminants in the combined toxic effects. Furthermore, for the first time, we describe the threats posed by MPs/NPs combined with other pollutants to human health, as well as their cytotoxic behavior and mechanism. We found that the Trojan horse effect of nanoplastics can increase the bioaccessibility of envi-ronmental pollutants, thus increasing the carcinogenic risk to humans. Simultaneously, the complex pollutants entering the cells are observed to be constantly dissociated due to the transport of lysosomes. However, current research on the intracellular release of MP/NP-loaded pollutants is relatively poor, which hinders the accurate in vivo toxicity assessment of combined pollutants. Based on the findings of our critical review, we recommend analyzing the toxic effects by clarifying the dose relationship of each component pollutant in cells, which is challenging yet crucial to exploring the toxic mechanism of combined pollution.

Many causes of AMI exist, which usually begin with mucosal injury. Onset is insiduous and there is frequent diagnostic delay. Current treatments can only control established injury and prevent propagation, hence new interventions are needed. The prevention and treatment of AMI by intraluminal delivery of oxygen has yet to be investigated in the clinical setting. This article aims to systemically review experimental studies investigating this novel therapy. MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, searches of PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were performed up to June 2022. Two independent investigators extracted the data. ResultsThere were 20 experimental studies, 16 of which used an occlusive ischaemia reperfusion model. Six different formulations were used to deliver intraluminal oxygen, with perflurocarbon being the most common. Studies consistently showed local and systemic benefits. Intraluminal oxygen therapy improved histological severity of mucosal injury in all studies when oxygen was delivered during the ischaemia phase, but could cause harm if given during the reperfusion phase. Improvement was also demonstrated in endpoints assessing intestinal function, biomarkers of intestinal damage, measures of systemic physiological derangement and mortality.

Trophic position (TP) of species is the key parameter in TMFs assessment. Nitrogen stable isotopes (delta N-15) provide a powerful tool to estimate TP. However, some limitations could introduce considerable uncertainty into TP and TMFs assessment which mainly includes: 1) determination of Delta N-15 between two adjacent trophic positions; 2) determination of baseline species. Different from the widely used constant Delta N-15 (3.4%) between two adjacent trophic positions, which is called additive Delta N-15 framework, Delta N-15 gradually decreases as trophic position increases under scaled Delta N-15 framework, which has been confirmed by more and more laboratory studies and meta-analyses. In this study, we sampled in two similar littoral ecosystems separated by one natural dam, which is called Small Xingkai Lake and Xingkai Lake, analyzed the delta N-15 and totalmercury (THg) of each species. On the one hand, we compared the TP of species under the additive Delta N-15 framework and scaled Delta N-15 framework with the White shrimp (Exopalaemon modestus) as baseline species in two lakes respectively.

Trophic position (TP) of species is the key parameter in TMFs assessment. Nitrogen stable isotopes (delta 15N) provide a powerful tool to estimate TP. However, some limitations could introduce considerable uncertainty into TP and TMFs assessment which mainly includes: 1) determination of Delta 15N between two adjacent trophic posi-tions; 2) determination of baseline species. Different from the widely used constant Delta 15N (3.4 parts per thousand) between two adja-cent trophic positions, which is called additive Delta 15N framework, Delta 15N gradually decreases as trophic position increases under scaled Delta 15N framework, which has been confirmed by more and more laboratory studies and meta-analyses. In this study, we sampled in two similar littoral ecosystems separated by one natural dam, which is called Small Xingkai Lake and Xingkai Lake, analyzed the delta 15N and total mercury (THg) of each species. On the one hand, we compared the TP of species under the additive Delta 15N framework and scaled Delta 15N framework with the White shrimp (Exopalaemon modestus) as baseline species in two lakes respectively. On the other hand, we explored the possible changes in TMFs based on TP. Our results show, under the scaled Delta 15N framework, the trophic position of the same species is higher, while TMFs is lower compared with the additive Delta 15N framework; even if in the two interconnected lakes, dis-tributed the same baseline species, in the similar ecosystem, separate baselines should also be used.

This work aimed to study the degree, composition, and the sources of contamination in the blue shark (Prionace glauca) inhabiting the Northeast Atlantic, as well as the potential risk faced by human consumers. A total of 60 sharks were sampled in situ aboard fishing vessels, and the concentrations of a set of metals and POPs were analysed in various tissues and complemented with stable isotope analyses. High levels of contaminants were found in most sharks sampled. The concentrations of most metals were higher in the muscle when compared with the liver. Regarding the dangers to consumers posed by the concentrations of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb), over 75% of the sharks presented muscle concentrations of at least one contaminant above the legal limits for human consumption, and a risk assessment determined that consumption of meat of these sharks exceeding 0.07 Kg per week could potentially expose human consumers to dangerous amounts of methylmercury (MeHg). Additionally, the assessment of single contaminants may lead to an underestimation of the risk for the human health.

Their application in agricultural fields and homes increased environmental pollution. Studies showed their harmful effects on human health, specifically children, who are more vulnerable than adults. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has introduced several pesticides as carcinogens. This study aims to systematically summarize and review all studies related to pesticides and cancer. Methodology: This systematic review is based on PRISMA rules. Three central databases were employed to find studies on pesticide exposure and cancer correlation published from 2017 to September 2022. Results: After reviewing several studies, we found that most studies revealed a significant relationship between pesticide exposure and an increased cancer incidence rate. Among the most studied group of pesticides is organochlorine (OC) pesticides. OC pesticides and their residues could significantly increase cancer in children and adults. Mechanistic studies revealed that pesticides could increase the risk of different cancers by genetics, like an increased expression of some genes like p21, p53 or epigenetic impairments. Cell cycle impairments like expanding the G1 to S phase transition are another mechanism of causing cancer. DNA methylation and histone modifications increase the risk of numerous cancers. Conclusion: Based on epidemiological studies, pesticides are a significant concern to human health, specifically cancer development, and should be more restrained. Their most reported mechanism of action were genetic and epigenetic impairments which cause cancers.",,,,,"Abdollahi, Mohammad/B-9232-2008","Abdollahi, Mohammad/0000-0003-0123-1209",,,,,,,,,,,,,0041-008X,1096-0333,,,,DEC 1,2022,456,,,,,,,,116280,10.1016/j.taap.2022.116280,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.taap.2022.116280,,OCT 2022,,,,,,36257464,,,,,WOS:000880812400001,View Full Record in Web of Science

The resultant GAP-FP copolymers represent a unique hybrid binder system with tunable energy releasing and oxidizing potentials intended for metallized formulations. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the carbonaceous residue usually formed from the decomposition of GAP could be reduced significantly by the copolymerization with FP. Isoconversional method of kinetic analysis of the GAP-FP co-polymers revealed an increasing dependence of the effective activation energy on the extent of conversion.

Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling as well as higher levels of liver nucleotides were observed at 4 months after PCB 126 exposure in mice, independent of diet status. Inflammatory responses including higher levels of serum cytokines and adipose inflammatory gene expression caused by early life PCB 126 were observed only in HFD-fed mice in adulthood. Notably, early life PCB 126 exposure worsened HFD-induced impaired glucose homeostasis characterized by glucose intolerance and elevated gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux without worsening the effects of HFD related to adiposity in adulthood. Furthermore, early life PCB 126 exposure resulted in diet-dependent changes in bacterial community structure and function later in life, as indicated by metagenomic and metabolomic analyses.

The previously isolated phenanthrene-degrading bacterial consortium (PDMC) consists of the genera Sphingobium and Pseudomonas and can degrade a wide range of PAHs. To identify the degradation mechanism of PAHs in the consortium PDMC, metagenomic binning was conducted and a Sphingomonadales assembly genome with 100% completeness was obtained. Additionally, Sphingobium sp. SHPJ-2, an efficient degrader of PAHs, was successfully isolated from the consortium PDMC. Strain SHPJ-2 has powerful degrading abilities and various degradation pathways of high-molecular-weight PAHs, including fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, and chrysene. Two ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases, five cytochrome P450s, and a pair of electron transfer chains associated with PAH degradation in strain SHPJ-2, which share 83.0%-99.0% similarity with their corresponding homologous proteins, were identified by a combination of Sphingomonadales assembly genome annotation, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and heterologous expression. Furthermore, when coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with the appropriate electron transfer chain, PhnA1B1 could effectively degrade chrysene and benzo[a]anthracene, while PhnA2B2 degrade fluoranthene.

Some phthalate metabolites and parabens were measured in the urine of 252 participants, and information were collected about their food habits, life styles and home environment to identify some predictors of exposure. Concomitantly, an awareness campaign was initiated by the Provincial Authorities of Liege and spread over 2 years. Three years later (2018), 92 of the initial participants provided again urine samples, and the levels of phthalate metabolites, phthalate substitute (DINCH), parabens, bisphenol-A and bisphenol alternatives (bisphenol-S, -F,-Z,-P) were determined and compared to those obtained in 2015 to assess time trends. In 2015, methyl- and ethylparaben were the most abundant parabens (P50 = 9.12 mu g/L and 1.1 mu g/L respectively), while propyl- and butylparaben were sparsely detected. Except for mono-2-ethylhexyl phthalate and 6-OH-mono-propyl-heptyl phthalate, all other targeted phthalate metabolites were positively quantified in most of the urine samples (between 89 and 98%) with median concentrations ranging between 2.7 mu g/L and 21.3 mu g/L depending on the metabolite. The multivariate regression models highlighted some significant associations between urinary phthalate metabolite or paraben levels and age, rural or urban character of the residence place, and the use of some personal care products. However, all determination coefficients were weak meaning that the usual covariates included in the models only explained a small part of the variance. Between 2015 and 2018, levels of parabens and phthalate metabolites significantly decreased (from 1.3 to 2.5 fold) except for monoethyl phthalate which seemed to remain quite constant. Contrariwise, all bisphenol alternatives and DINCH metabolites were measured in higher concentrations in 2018 vs 2015 while BPA levels did not differ significantly.

Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) process has become one of the most dominant discharge sources of dioxins. A comprehensive discussion about dioxin formation mechanisms was reviewed in this paper, and the mechanisms of high-temperature gas-phase reaction and de novo synthesis were systematically illustrated in the form of diagrams. What's more, the effects of various influencing factors on the formation of PCDD/Fs were briefly analyzed in the form of a table. We believed that temperature, catalyst, chlorine source, carbon source, oxygen concentration and moisture were necessary factors for PCDD/Fs formation. Control technologies of dioxins in MSWI process were summarized subsequently from three stages: pre-combustion, in-combustion and post-combustion, and a device for synergistic removal of dioxins based on multi-field force coupling and technical routes for controlling dioxin emissions were proposed, so as to provide mechanisms and methods for effectively reducing the emission concentration of dioxins. An introduction was also conducted of dioxin control technologies in municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI-FA) in this paper, and their mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages and technical maturity were illustrated in the form of diagrams, which can provide theory and reference for in-depth research of follow-up scholars and industrial application of dioxin control technologies.

Shrimp waste is a potential raw material to generate green dispersants. The biodegradability of dispersed oil and dispersants themselves are key factors for the national consideration of the approval, stockpile, and usage of dispersants. However, it is unknown whether shrimp-waste-based dispersant (SWD) has high bioavailability or facilitates the biodegradation of dispersed oil. In this study, we tackled the biodegradation of oil dispersed by a purified SWD. Furthermore, the SWD biodegradability was evaluated by exploring the degradation genes via metagenomic sequencing, analyzing the enzymatic activities for dispersant biodegradation by molecular docking, and discussing the SWD toxicity. We discovered that the SWD facilitated the biodegra-dation of two crude oils (Alaska North Slope and Marine Fuel-No.6). The metagenomic analysis with molecular docking showed that fresh seawater had feasible enzymes to degrade the SWD to safety components. Addi-tionally, the SWD was low toxic and high bioactive. The findings helped confirm that the purified SWD is an effective and eco-sustainable marine oil spill treating agent and tracked the biodegradation of dispersed oil and the SWD.",,,,,"Zhang, Baiyu/AAG-1347-2019; Chen, Bing/D-2080-2013","Zhang, Baiyu/0000-0002-6997-4765; Chen, Bing/0000-0003-1041-4525; Song, Xing/0000-0003-0553-1196",,,,,,,,,,,,,0304-3894,1873-3336,,,,OCT 5,2022,439,,,,,,,,129617,10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129617,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhazmat.2022.129617,,JUL 2022,,,,,,35872457,,,,,WOS:000835652800006,View Full Record in Web of Science

Despite this, knowledge of the fate of plastic debris in estuaries is limited. Our study assesses the current state of knowledge on the distribution of microplastic debris in estuaries and their intertidal habitats. The literature is reviewed, and an estuarine plastics conceptual model is presented. The conceptual model is populated with data to show the globally averaged standing stocks of microplastic (< 5 mm) debris in estuarine waters and sediments. Estuarine plastic debris studies have previously focused on subtidal sediment and surface waters more than intertidal habitats. Estimated mean microplastic abundance is found to be greater (H = 53.136, P = 0.000175) per volume of sediment than per volume of water, although there are large standard deviations within habitats and some caveats regarding variation in methods and limited data in published studies. We found that the most commonly recovered microplastics align with the most commonly used polymers, and that the rates of microplastic transfer between estuarine compartments remain poorly understood. This study informs global plastic transport models by demonstrating the ability of estuaries to trap large quantities of microplastic debris, but substantial differences in the methodologies between estuarine microplastic studies limit the value of global assessments of estuarine microplastics. The main recommendations from this study focus on improving data availability and stand-ardisation to better enable study comparisons and to improve our ability to examine global trends.",,,,,,"Stead, Jessica/0000-0002-1613-659X; Biltcliff-Ward, Adam/0000-0002-8904-6042",,,,,,,,,,,,,0272-7714,1096-0015,,,,SEP 30,2022,275,,,,,,,,107963,10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107963,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecss.2022.107963,,JUL 2022,,,,,,,,,,,WOS:000827554500003,View Full Record in Web of Science

Z.",,,Microbial Remediation: A Promising Tool for Reclamation of Contaminated Sites with Special Emphasis on Heavy Metal and Pesticide Pollution: A Review,PROCESSES,,,,,,,,,,,,"Heavy metal and pesticide pollution have become an inevitable part of the modern industrialized environment that find their way into all ecosystems. Because of their persistent nature, recalcitrance, high toxicity and biological enrichment, metal and pesticide pollution has threatened the stability of the environment as well as the health of living beings. Due to the environmental persistence of heavy metals and pesticides, they get accumulated in the environs and consequently lead to food chain contamination. Therefore, remediation of heavy metals and pesticide contaminations needs to be addressed as a high priority. Various physico-chemical approaches have been employed for this purpose, but they have significant drawbacks such as high expenses, high labor, alteration in soil properties, disruption of native soil microflora and generation of toxic by-products. Researchers worldwide are focusing on bioremediation strategies to overcome this multifaceted problem, i.e., the removal, immobilization and detoxification of pesticides and heavy metals, in the most efficient and cost-effective ways. For a period of millions of evolutionary years, microorganisms have become resistant to intoxicants and have developed the capability to remediate heavy metal ions and pesticides, and as a result, they have helped in the restoration of the natural state of degraded environs with long term environmental benefits. Keeping in view the environmental and health concerns imposed by heavy metals and pesticides in our society, we aimed to present a generalized picture of the bioremediation capacity of microorganisms. We explore the use of bacteria, fungi, algae and genetically engineered microbes for the remediation of both metals and pesticides. This review summarizes the major detoxification pathways and bioremediation technologies; in addition to that, a brief account is given of molecular approaches such as systemic biology, gene editing and omics that have enhanced the bioremediation process and widened its microbiological techniques toward the remediation of heavy metals and pesticides.",,,,,"Sayyed, R.

On the other hand, these pesticides are a double-edged sword because they have both acute effects and chronic adverse effects on human health. The widespread use of pesticides has led to their persistence in soil, water, and agricultural products, thus posing a serious threat to public health. Therefore, the removal and analysis of pesticides are critical to protecting human safety and health. When removing pesticides from the environment, it is imperative to ensure high removal efficiency while preventing secondary pollution to the environment. Because of the low concentrations of pesticide residue in the environment, complex matrix, and large throughput of pesticide residue analysis, a low-cost fast pre-treatment technique that has strong selectivity and an enrichment effect on the target pesticide residue, with little environmental impact, is required. Plant biomass-derived biochar is obtained from wheat straw, corn cob, rice husk, etc. This material has a large specific surface area, high pore capacity, tunable surface functional groups, and good environmental compatibility, which make it an inexpensive and efficient adsorbent. Hence, there is a need to systematically review the knowledge regarding the application of plant-based biochar on pesticide removal and pesticide residue analysis. This paper reviews the application progress of plant biomass-derived biochar in the above mentioned two areas over the last decade. The pesticide removal applications include reducing the mobility of pesticides in soil, eliminating the pollution caused by chiral pesticides, loading pesticide-degrading bacteria, and releasing fertilizers sustainably when removing pesticide. As mentioned above, plant biomass-derived biochar has a large specific surface area, a high number of functional groups on the surface, and good environmental compatibility. Therefore, it can effectively remove pesticides or their metabolites from the environment without causing any secondary pollution. During pre-treatment, plan biomass-derived biochar is used as an adsorbent for dispersive solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, and magnetic solid-phase extraction to selectively adsorb organophosphorus and triazole pesticides in fruits and vegetables, as well as organochlorine pesticides in the aquatic environment. This paper also introduces the adsorption mechanism of plant biomass-derived biochar, where studies based on computational simulations such as the density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulation, and giant canonical Monte Carlo simulation are carefully discussed. The benefits of adopting computational simulations are also mentioned. Finally, this paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of using plant biomass-derived biochar in pesticide removal and pre-treatment, as well as the future research trends in this area.",,,,,"Fu, penny/HIU-0572-2022",,,,,,,,,,,,,,1000-8713,,,,,JUN 8,2022,40,6,,,,,499,508,,10.3724/SP.J.1123.2021.10024,http://dx.doi.org/10.3724/SP.J.1123.2021.10024,,,,,,,,35616195,,,,,WOS:000864749300003,View Full Record in Web of Science
