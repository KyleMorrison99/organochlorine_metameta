	abstract = {Air pollution is a major environmental issue of global concern. According to the latest statistics from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study, air pollution is the fourth leading cause of premature death and the largest environmental risk factor worldwide. After the implementation of air quality regulations and technological advances, air pollution levels have declined in recent decades. However, the dose–response relationship between the mass concentration of atmospheric particles and adverse effects is nonlinear. Refined pollution control measures that target key high-risk components in the atmosphere, rather than just particulate matter mass concentrations, may become more important for public health. It is very challenging to identify high-risk organic pollutants in the atmosphere because of the extreme complexity of atmospheric particulate matter components. Nontargeted analysis and suspect screening analysis offer analytical approaches for identifying unknown and unregulated organic compounds. Additional tools and strategies are needed to reduce the number of chemicals of interest and focus analytical efforts on chemicals that may pose high risks to humans and the environment. In this paper, we systematically review the methods and recent findings for screening of high-risk air pollutants: (1) Recognize novel air pollutants using advanced analytical techniques and conduct risk-based prioritization; (2) combine biological and chemical analysis tools to identify key risk drivers in complex atmospheric mixtures. This revealed some previously unknown hazardous pollutants in outdoor air, indoor air, and individual exposure samples. To tackle the persistent challenges of air pollution and enhance the understanding of the link between air pollution and human health, screening methods should be improved. This could be achieved through the development of a global platform for integrating and sharing atmospheric pollutant data, strengthening the integration and analysis of toxic compound data, using machine learning for multi-level mining of big data, and creating toxicological models with high-throughput assessment capabilities that closely resemble human tissues. To enhance our understanding of what we breathe affects our health, it is necessary to consider multiple factors comprehensively, such as mixed exposure effects, unknown toxicological targets, interactions between chemical and biological pollutants, and coupling with natural or social environmental exposure. It is also important to investigate human exposure to atmospheric particulate matters with a focus on susceptible populations and critical windows. The use of multiomics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics, to analyze the complex multilevel interactions of pollutants with humans has created the exciting new field of exposomics in which exposures are directly linked to disease causal pathways. It is necessary to build statistical analysis models, carry out toxicological simulations, and conduct intervention validation and policy evaluation around the key risk factors, so as to form a risk assessment system with strong causal relationship. Such studies are important for identifying air pollutants for priority control and concentrating efforts to carry out follow-up environmental behavior investigations and toxicity testing. © 2024 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Childhood diseases correspond to major public health issues. A large number of studies using different approaches provide evidence regarding effects of environmental exposures, encompassed in the exposome, on children's health. We aimed to summarize the overall level of evidence (LoE) from all streams of evidence regarding exposome effects on child health. For 88 selected chemical and urban factors, we retrieved the conclusions of agency reports or literature reviews published between 2015 and 2021 regarding effects on child health, including cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodevelopmental, respiratory and other health outcomes. Adapted versions of PRISMA flowchart and AMSTAR-2 tool were used to select and assess the quality of the systematic reviews retrieved from PubMed and SCOPUS databases. For each factor-outcome pair, conclusions in three streams of evidence (epidemiological, toxicological and mechanistic, the latter corresponding to in vitro and in silico approaches) were translated into stream-specific LoEs and then combined into an overall LoE ranging from “very unlikely” to “very likely”. The 88 environmental factors were implied in 611 factor-outcome pairs. Forty-four pairs (7%), corresponding to 16 factors, had a very likely overall LoE (≥80%); 127 pairs (21%), corresponding to 49 factors, had a likely or more overall LoE (≥60%). For 81 pairs (13%), no evidence was available in agency reports or published reviews, while for 275 pairs (45%), corresponding to 68 factors, the overall LoE was very unlikely (<20%). Exposure factors with the greatest number of associated health outcomes with a high overall LoE were HCB, PCBs, temperature (8 outcomes), PFOA (7 outcomes), PFOS, cotinine (6 outcomes), arsenic, lead (5 outcomes), bisphenols A and S, PFNA and PM2.5 (4 outcomes), DDT, DDE and DDD, PFHxA, PFDA, green space, UV radiation (3 outcomes). We developed an approach to extract and summarize the existing evidence about effects of environmental factors on health. The plausibility database built for children's health can be used to identify research gaps, conduct quantitative risk assessment studies. It could be expanded to consider a larger fraction of the exposome and other age groups and should be updated on a regular basis. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Mixed legacy and emerging per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are commonly found in soil and dust; however, the potential toxicity of PFAS mixtures (mPFASs) in insects is unknown. Using 16S rRNA gene sequencing and transcriptome sequencing (RNA-Seq), we evaluated the adverse effects of mPFASs on silkworms, a typical lepidopteran insect. After exposure to mPFASs, the silkworm midgut was enriched with high levels of PFASs, which induced histopathological changes. The composition of the midgut microbiota was significantly affected by mPFAS exposure, and functional predictions revealed significant disruption of some metabolic pathways. RNA-seq analysis revealed that mPFASs significantly changed the transcription profiles. Functional enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes also revealed that biological processes related to metabolic pathways and the digestive system were significantly affected, similar to the results of the gut microbiota analysis, suggesting that mPFAS exposure had an adverse effect on the metabolic function of silkworms and may further affect their normal growth. Finally, the significant correlation between abundance changes in the gut microbiota and metabolism/digestion-related genes further highlighted the role of the gut microbiota in mPFAS-related processes affecting the metabolic functions of silkworms. To our knowledge, this study is the first to evaluate the toxic effects of mPFASs in insects and provide basic data for further PFAS toxicity investigations in insects and comprehensive ecological risk assessments of mPFASs. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Environmental contamination with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has sever effects on the ecosystem worldwide. DDT is a recalcitrant synthetic chemical with high toxicity and lipophilicity. It is also bioaccumulated in the food chain and causes genotoxic, estrogenic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic effects on aquatic organisms and humans. Microbial remediation mechanism and its enzymes are very important for removing DDT from environment. DDT and its main residues dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) can biodegrade slowly in soil and water. To enhance this process, a number of strategies are proposed, such as bio-attenuation, biostimulation, bioaugmentation and the manipulation of environmental conditions to enhance the activity of microbial enzymes. The addition of organic matter and flooding of the soil enhance DDT degradation. Microbial candidates for DDT remediation include micro-algae, fungi and bacteria. This review provide brief information and recommendation on microbial DDT remediation and its mechanisms. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {The increasing health risks posed by per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) in the environment highlight the importance of implementing effective removal techniques. Conventional wastewater treatment processes are inadequate for removing persistent organic pollutants. Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are capable of removing PFASs from water through adsorption techniques. However, there is still constructive discussion on the potential of MOFs in adsorbing and removing PFASs for large-scale engineering applications. This review systematically investigates the use of MOFs as adsorbents for the removal of PFAS in water treatment. This primarily involved a comprehensive analysis of existing literature to understand the adsorption mechanisms of MOFs and to identify factors that enhance their efficiency in removing PFASs. We also explore the critical aspects of regeneration and stability of MOFs, assessing their reusability and long-term performance, which are essential for large-scale water treatment applications. Finally, our study highlights the challenges of removing PFASs using MOFs. Especially, the efficient removal of short-chain PFASs with hydrophilicity is a major challenge, while medium- to long-chain PFASs are frequently susceptible to being captured from water by MOFs through multiple synergistic effects. The ion-exchange force may be the key to solving this difficulty, but its susceptibility to ion interference in water needs to be addressed in practical applications. We hope that this review can provide valuable insights into the effective removal and adsorption mechanisms of PFASs as well as advance the sustainable utilization of MOFs in the field of water treatment, thereby presenting a novel perspective. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Background: Findings related to the association between persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) are inconclusive. Objectives: To estimate the strength of the association between POP exposure and GDM in a systematic review with meta-analysis. Search strategy: MEDLINE, Scopus and Web of Science were searched until July 2023. Selection criteria: Cohort and case–control studies analysing the association between POPs and GDM. Data collection and analysis: We assessed the risk of bias using the Quality in Prognosis Studies scale (QUIPS). Standardised mean differences were pooled using random-effect models. Main results: Sixteen articles including 12 216 participants were selected. The risk of bias was high in four articles (25%), moderate in 11 (68.75%) and low in one (6.25%). Small mean difference between GDM cases and controls was observed for PFHpA (0.26, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.1–0.35, I2 = 0.0%), PCB180 (0.37, 95% CI 0.19–0.56; I2 = 25.3%), BDE47 (0.23, 95% CI 0.0–0.45, I2 = 0%), BDE99 (0.36, 95% CI 0.14–0.59; I2 = 0%), BDE100 (0.42, 95% CI 0.19–0.64; I2 = 0%) and HCB (0.22, 95% CI 0.01–0.42, I2 = 39.6%). No considerable difference was observed for the rest of POPs. Conclusion: Small mean differences between GDM cases and controls were observed for some POPs. However, evidence shows mostly moderate quality and results were heterogeneous. Improved research methodology is needed to assess POPs and GDM risk. © 2023 The Authors.

Here, the PFOA-associated effects on immune system were evaluated in Ruditapes philippinarum using integrated analysis of metabolomes, microbiomes, and transcriptomes, providing evidence for possible mechanisms related to immunotoxicity. PFOA exposure caused clear variation in several important metabolites related to immune regulatory function within the haemolyph from R. philippinarum, while also altering key metabolic pathways, including those of lipids, unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), and bile acids (BAs). After exposure to PFOAs, intestinal bacterial communities also clearly changed, with the predominant microflora becoming Mycoplasma and Bacteroidetes that are related to intestinal inflammation. Molecular analyses provided consistent results, wherein the expression of immune-related genes was significantly altered. Integration of the multi-‘omics’ analyses suggested that the TLR/MyD88/NF-kB pathway, along with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, PPAR-mediated lipid metabolism and the autophagy signaling pathway, likely play important roles in initiating immunotoxic effects in R. philippinarum after PFOA exposure. These results provide further evidence that PFOA exposure can lead to immunologic dysfunction and also provide new insights into the mechanisms of PFAS alteration of bivalve immune function. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

Therefore, in order to control the spread of antibiotic resistance in the environment, advanced oxidation technology (such as Fenton-like, photocatalysis, electrocatalysis) has become an effective weapon for inactivating and eliminating ARB and ARGs. However, in the process of advanced oxidation technology, studying and regulating catalytic active sites at the molecular level and studying the adsorption and surface oxidation reactions between catalysts and ARGs can achieve in-depth exploration of the mechanism of ARGs removal. This review systematically reveals the catalytic sites and related mechanisms of catalytic antagonistic genes in different advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) systems. We also summarize the removal mechanism of ARGs and how to reduce the spread of ARGs in the environment through combining a variety of characterization methods. Importantly, the potential of various catalysts for removing ARGs in practical applications has also been recognized, providing a promising approach for the deep purification of wastewater treatment plants. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Epidemiological evidence suggests that exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is associated with lipid profile levels, but with inconsistent conclusions from different studies. The aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis of the relationship between PFAS exposure and lipid profile levels based on population-based epidemiological studies. Embase, PubMed, Ovid database, The Cochrane Library and Web of Science database were used to search appropriate studies (before September 6, 2022) on the correlation between PFAS exposure and lipid profile levels. β value, odd ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were extracted from studies. In this study, we found that higher low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels were associated with exposure to perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA) (β value=0.13, 95 % CIs: 0.02, 0.24) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) (β value=0.13, 95 % CIs: 0.04, 0.21). PFOA, PFOS and PFNA exposure were significantly related to the higher levels of total cholesterol (TC) with the pooled effect estimates of 0.08 (95 % CI: 0.02, 0.14), 0.13 (95 % CI: 0.05, 0.21) and 0.14 (95 % CI: 0.08, 0.20) respectively. In sum, our results identified that PFOA, PFOS, PFNA and PFUnDA were the most important risk factors for abnormal levels of lipid profile, indicating that we should prevent cerebrovascular disease by reducing and controlling PFAS exposure. © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2024.},

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are currently one of the major environmental challenges within our society. With the awareness of the impact of MPs on the environment increasing over the last years, the need for increased monitoring as well as comprehensive analysis to better understand the fate and impact of MPs has become more and more important. A major aspect of MP characterization is the assignment of the polymer type of individual particles. Here, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), originating from fluor-containing polymers, have gained a lot of attention due to the severe environmental impact. Additionally, quantitative analysis of the metal content is of great interest in the field, since MPs are prone to either leaching (in)organic additives into the environment or taking up and accumulating hazardous components (e.g., heavy metals). In this work we demonstrate the capabilities of a simultaneous LIBS/LA-ICP-MS setup for the analysis of MPs. In the first part, we demonstrate the potential of targeted LIBS analysis for the imaging of fluor-containing polymers. Using a laser spot size of 5 μm combined with highly sensitive ICCD detection enables analysis of particles in the low μm range. In the second part we combine the polymer-identification capabilities of LIBS with the high sensitivity of ICP-MS to perform matrix-matched quantification of the metal content of individual MPs. In this case we use a spot size of 50 μm facilitating polymer classification with a broadband spectrometer, resulting in detection limits of 0.72 μg/g for Pb and 9.5 μg/g for Sn simultaneously measured using ICP-MS. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) composed of different polymers with various shapes, within a vast granulometric distribution (1 μm - 5 mm) and with a wide variety of physicochemical surface and bulk characteristics spiral around the globe, with different atmospheric, oceanic, cryospheric, and terrestrial residence times, while interacting with other pollutants and biota. The challenges of microplastic pollution are related to the complex relationships between the microplastic generation mechanisms (physical, chemical, and biological), their physicochemical properties, their interactions with other pollutants and microorganisms, the changes in their properties with aging, and their small sizes that facilitate their diffusion and transportation between the air, water, land, and biota, thereby promoting their ubiquity. Early career researchers (ERCs) constitute an essential part of the scientific community committed to overcoming the challenges of microplastic pollution with their new ideas and innovative scientific perspectives for the development of remediation technologies. However, because of the enormous amount of scientific information available, it may be difficult for ERCs to determine the complexity of this environmental issue. This mini-review aims to provide a quick and updated overview of the essential insights of microplastic pollution to ERCs to help them acquire the background needed to develop highly innovative physical, chemical, and biological remediation technologies, as well as valorization proposals and environmental education and awareness campaigns. Moreover, the recommendations for the development of holistic microplastic pollution remediation strategies presented here can help ERCs propose technologies considering the environmental, social, and practical dimensions of microplastic pollution while fulfilling the current government policies to manage this plastic waste. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Ammonium perfluoro (2-methyl-3-oxahexanoate) (GenX), a replacement for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has been detected in multiple environmental media and biological samples worldwide. Accumulated evidence implies that GenX exposure might exert adverse health effects, although the underlying mechanisms have not been fully revealed. In this study, pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to GenX (2 mg/kg/day), PFOA (1 mg/kg/day), or Milli-Q water by gavage from the first day of gestation (GD0) until GD21. Necropsy and tissue collection were conducted in pups at 4 weeks of age. PFOA and GenX induced similar histopathological changes in both the liver and the intestinal mucosa, accompanied by higher serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase. Moreover, the capacity of hepatic glycogen storage and intestinal mucus secretion were significantly decreased, suggesting dysfunction of liver metabolism and the intestinal mucosal barrier. A total of 637 and 352 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the liver tissues of GenX and PFOA group, respectively. Most of the enriched pathways from the DEGs by KEGG enrichment analysis were metabolism-associated. Moreover, overexpression of CYP4A14, Sult2a1, Cpt1b, Acaa1b, Igfbp1, Irs-2 and decreased expression of Gys2 were observed in livers of GenX exposed pups, supporting the hypothesis that there was metabolic disruption. Furthermore, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest proteins (Gadd45β, p21, Ppard) were significantly increased, while cell proliferation-related proteins (Cyclin E, Myc, EGFR) were decreased by gestational GenX exposure in the pups' liver. In addition, imbalance of gut microbiota and dysfunction of the intestinal mucosa barrier might contribute to hepatotoxicity at least in part. Taken together, our results suggested that gestational GenX exposure triggered metabolic disorder, which might be responsible for the hepatotoxicity in the pups in addition to dysfunction of the intestinal mucosa barrier. This study enriches the mechanisms of GenX-induced developmental hepatotoxicity by associating metabolic disorder with intestinal homeostasis. © 2023},

The photocatalytic fundamentals of MHP-based photocatalysts including the basic mechanism of heterogeneous photocatalysis along with their synthesis methods have been summarized. The multifunctional properties of MHP-based photocatalysts in the degradation of organic pollutants have been emphasized through the presentation of several related recent studies. However, there is still no consensus among researchers about the most efficient composites as many challenges exist. While previously published papers on metal halide perovskite photocatalysts provided a general discussion on the various applications of MHPs in several aspects, the current review specifies and details the application MHPs on water treatment. Further, the effect of the different MHP synthesis methods on the removal of organic contaminants from water was addressed. Besides, this review enumerates the major obstacles that impede the wide application of MHP photocatalysis, and aims at suggesting some solutions to be accounted for in future research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Chlorinated organic compounds are widely used as solvents, but they are pollutants that can have adverse effects on the environment and human health. Dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria (DIRB) such as Shewanella and Geobacter have been applied to treat a wide range of halogenated organic compounds due to their specific biological properties. Until now, there has been no systematic review on the mechanisms of direct or indirect degradation of halogenated organic compounds by DIRB. This work summarizes the discussion of DIRB's ability to enhance the dechlorination of reaction systems through different pathways, both biological and biochemical. For biological dechlorination, some DIRB have self-dechlorination capabilities that directly dechlorinate by hydrolysis. Adjustment of dechlorination genes through genetic engineering can improve the dechlorination capabilities of DIRB. DIRB can also adjust the capacity for the microbial community to dechlorinate and provide nutrients to enhance the expression of dechlorination genes in other bacteria. In biochemical dechlorination, DIRB bioconverts Fe(III) to Fe(II), which is capable of dichlorination. On this basis, the DIRB-driven Fenton reaction can efficiently degrade chlorinated organics by continuously maintaining anoxic conditions to generate Fe(II) and oxic conditions to generate H2O2. DIRB can drive microbial fuel cells due to their electroactivity and have a good dechlorination capacity at low levels of energy consumption. The contribution of DIRB to the removal of pesticides, antibiotics and POPs is summarized. Then the DIRB electron transfer mechanism is discussed, which is core to their ability to dechlorinate. Finally, the prospect of future work on the removal of chlorine-containing organic pollutants by DIRB is presented, and the main challenges and further research directions are suggested. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The widespread application of pesticides in Morocco’s agriculture renders their monitoring in food and environmental samples very necessary. Recent years have witnessed a growing interest in reporting studies related to the monitoring of pesticide residues in food, water, groundwater, and soil as well as their quantitative health risk assessment. Most published studies have been done by university researchers. However, the lack of research reproducibility remains a problem that considerably limits the possibility of exploiting data from the literature. Our study involves an extensive literature review utilizing search engines with keywords like “pesticide residues,” “monitoring,” “vegetables and fruits,” “water and soil,” “risk assessment,” and “Morocco” from 2009 to 2023. Analysis of pesticide residues in foodstuffs and environmental samples highlights concerns over compliance with EU regulations, the health risks associated with pesticide exposure, and the necessity for comprehensive monitoring and risk assessment strategies. This paper could help influence policies to develop a strategy and action plan for the sound management of pesticides, including measures to reduce their use, raise awareness, and monitor compliance. Also, this paper could be useful for scientists interested in understanding the current situation and challenges regarding pesticide residues in Morocco, as well as countries with which commercial links exist. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Melanoma is a type of skin cancer considered aggressive due to its high metastatic ability and rapid progression to other tissues and organs. BDE-209 (2,2′,3,3′,4,4′,5,5′,6,6′-decabromodiphenyl ether) is an additive used as a flame retardant and classified as a persistent organic pollutant that has a high bioaccumulation capacity due to its lipophilic nature. This substance has already been detected in rivers, air, soil, plants and even in different human biological samples, such as plasma, umbilical cord blood and breast milk, revealing a great concern to human populations. Thus, in the current study we investigated whether prior exposure of murine melanoma B16–F1 cells to BDE-209 modulates in vivo progression and malignancy of melanoma. B16–F1 cells were cultured and exposed in vitro to BDE-209 (0.01, 0.1 e 1 nM) for 15 days and then inoculated, via caudal vein, in C57BL/6 mice for experimental metastasis analysis after 20 days. Inoculation of BDE-209-exposed cells resulted in 82% increase of metastasis colonized area in the lungs of mice, downregulation of tumor suppressors genes, such as Timp3 and Reck, decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of systemic and local inflammatory response. These findings are related to melanoma progression. Additionally, the histopathological analysis revealed greater number of focal points of metastases in the lungs and invasiveness of metastases to the mice brain (89%). The results showed that exposure to BDE-209 may alter the phenotype of B16–F1 cells, worsening their metastatic profile. Current data showed that BDE-209 may interfere with the prognosis of melanoma by modulating cells with less invasiveness capacity to a more aggressive profile. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Therefore, the present study investigated the levels of eleven heavy metals such as arsenic (As), barium (Ba), cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr), copper (Cu), mercury (Hg), manganese (Mn), nickel (Ni), lead (Pb) antimony (Sb), and vanadium (V) in two fish species (Mugil cephalus and Diplodus annularis) caught in the Tyrrhenian Sea along the Campania coast and assessed the risk arising from fish consumption. The analysis of heavy metals in fish edible parts was performed by Q-ICP-MS and the risk assessment was estimated by the Hazard Quotient (HQ) and the Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR). There were statistical differences between two fish species for three heavy metals such as Cd, As, and Hg in muscle samples which were higher in Diplodus annularis. Nevertheless, no samples exceeded the legal limits set for Pb, Cd, and Hg. The HQs and ILCRs showed potential risks for exposure to As, Cd, and Hg concentrations above the median. However, the no speciation of As overestimated the risk probably. Overall, the ecological features of Diplodus annularis could lead to greater bioaccumulation of heavy metals than Mugil cephalus, underscoring the need for continued assessment of different species to address potential risks. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Introduction. The ideology of Fast Track-Surgery (FTS) and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) represents modern trends in global surgical practice. Anesthesiology aims to provide ideal and universal solutions for protecting patients from surgical aggression. A multimodal approach, which includes multilevel, multifaceted antinociception, is well-founded, where maximum effectiveness is combined with minimal side effects. The aim. To analyze the issue of multimodal pain management as an important component of ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) from modern sources of literature for optimizing perioperative care in the minimally invasive surgery department. Materials and methods. Bibliosemantic, comparative, and systemic analysis methods were employed. The proposed recommendations were developed based on an analysis of modern literature, the results of randomized trials and meta-analyses, as well as our own studies dedicated to the study of perioperative pain issues. The results. It has been proven that the use of opioids in anesthesia practice is decreasing. New and modern methods of continuous monitoring of vital organs in patients are being introduced as supplements to classical monitoring protocols. These methods are used to avoid excessive or inadequate dosing of anesthetics, adjust the concentration of substances used, reduce post-anesthesia complications, and improve patient comfort. The method of perioperative energy monitoring significantly complements the «International Standards for Safe Anesthetic Practice», WFSA (2010), and enhances perioperative patient safety by detecting metabolic disturbances and implementing appropriate pathogenetic correction. The importance of regional anesthesia under ultrasound control, nociception-antinociception balance management, and the impact of these methods on opioid consumption, patient satisfaction, and postoperative recovery have been proven. Conclusions. The most commonly used combination of drugs for multimodal analgesia often includes acetaminophen and NSAIDs (strong recommendation). It has been proven that deep and prolonged sedation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is associated with worse outcomes, longer mechanical ventilation duration, extended ICU and hospital stays, and higher rates of complications, including infections and sometimes even death. © 2024, State Institution of Science "Research and Practical Center of Preventive and Clinical Medicine" State Administration Department.

	abstract = {Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is persistent endocrine disrupting chemicals. Previous evidence suggests that exposure to PFAS is associated with reproductive hormone levels, but the results of relevant studies are inconsistent. The objective of our study is to determine the association between exposure to PFAS and reproductive hormone levels in gender-specific general population. Method: Based on scientific search strategies, we systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Medline, and Scopus to obtain the eligible studies published before January 21, 2023. The quality of the included articles was assessed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) Risk of Bias tool. We combined the β coefficient and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using Stata.17 with random-effect model or fixed-effect model. We also performed subgroup analysis, sensitivity analysis, and Begger's and Egger's tests. Results: Eleven studies involving 7714 participants were included. Meta-analysis showed that PFHxS exposure was positively associated with estradiol (E2) levels in female [β = 0.030, 95% CI: (0.013, 0.046), P = 0.000]. A negative association was found between PFOA [β = −0.012, 95% CI: (−0.023, −0.002), P = 0.017] and PFOS [β = −0.011; 95% CI: (−0.021, −0.000), P = 0.042] exposure with male testosterone (TT) levels. In the subgroup analysis, there were stronger associations in children than in adults. And the high heterogeneity was mainly due to the cross-sectional studies. Publication bias was not found in most of the analyses. Conclusion: Our study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with reproductive hormone levels. Further related studies are needed to identify the association and potential mechanism in the future. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Chlorinated paraffins (CPs) are widely produced chemicals. Short-chain CPs (SCCPs) and medium-chain CPs (MCCPs) were listed as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and candidate POPs under the Stockholm Convention, respectively. The present study explored the developmental toxicity and metabolic disruption caused by SCCPs and MCCPs in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. CPs exposure at environmentally relevant levels caused no obvious phenotypic changes with zebrafish larvae except that the body length shortening was observed after exposure to CPs at 1–200 μg/L for 7 day post fertilization. A further metabolomic approach was conducted to explore the early biological responses of developmental toxicity induced by CPs at low dose (1, 5, and 10 μg/L). The results of metabolic disorder, pathway analysis and chronic values indicated that, compared with SCCPs, MCCPs exhibited more risks to zebrafish larvae at low doses. Lipid metabolism was markedly affected in SCCPs exposure group, whereas MCCPs primarily disturbed lipid metabolism, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolisms. Compare with SCCPs, the relatively higher lipid solubility, protein affinity and metabolic rate of MCCPs can probably explain why MCCP-mediated metabolic disruption was significantly higher than that of SCCP. Notably, SCCPs and MCCPs have the same potential to cause cancer, but no evidence indicates the mutagenicity.

	abstract = {Maternal endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) exposure, the common environmental pollutants, was capable of involving in adverse pregnancy outcomes. However, the evidence of their connection is not consistent. Our goal was to comprehensively explore the risk of EDCs related to adverse pregnancy outcomes. One hundred and one studies were included from two databases before 2023 to explore the association between EDCs and adverse pregnancy outcomes including miscarriage, small for gestational age (SGA), low birth weight (LBW) and preterm birth (PTB). We found that maternal PFASs exposure was positively correlated with PTB (OR:1.13, 95% CI:1.04–1.23), SGA (OR:1.10, 95% CI:1.04–1.16) and miscarriage (OR:1.09, 95% CI:1.00–1.19). The pooled estimates also showed maternal PAEs exposure was linked with PTB (OR:1.16, 95% CI:1.11–1.21), SGA (OR:1.20, 95% CI:1.07–1.35) and miscarriage (OR:1.55, 95% CI:1.33–1.81). In addition, maternal exposure to some specific class of EDCs including PFOS, MBP, MEHP, DEHP, and BPA was associated with PTB. Maternal exposure to PFOS, PFOA, PFHpA was associated with SGA. Maternal exposure to BPA was associated with LBW. Maternal exposure to MMP, MEHP, MEHHP, MEOHP, BPA was associated with miscarriage. Maternal PFASs, PAEs and BPA exposure may increase adverse pregnancy outcomes risk according to our study. However, the limited number of studies on dose-response hampered further explanation for causal association. © 2023},

	abstract = {Inadequately treated or untreated wastewater contributes substantially to the discharge of undesirable and hazardous substances into aquatic environments. Serious concerns are raised when certain pollutants become persistent and bioaccumulative upon release into the environment. Despite the existence of alternative wastewater treatment technologies, adsorption has consistently demonstrated its efficacy in the treatment of wastewater originating from diverse industrial sources. Adsorption is selected as the optimal method due to its numerous benefits, which include greater efficacy, reduced cost, and convenient accessibility in comparison to alternative treatments. Biosorption using naturally occurring seaweeds can, however, remove contaminants from a variety of sources, including heavy metals, nitrogen, phosphorus, and phenolic compounds, and dyes from the paper, textile, and printing industries. Biosorption utilizing seaweed has surfaces as a feasible substitute for existing technologies in the effective elimination of these pollutants from effluent on account of its environmentally sustainable nature, readily available resources, and cost-effectiveness. An economical adsorbent known as seaweed is examined in this article in order to remove contaminants from effluent. In an extensive table, the application of seaweed in effluent treatment is detailed. The majority of studies, according to published research, have utilized simulated wastewater; biosorption using seaweed to remediate actual wastewater has received less attention. © The Authors, published by EDP Sciences.

	abstract = {Introduction: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are potentially obesogenic for children. We undertook a systematic review to synthesize this literature and explore sources of heterogeneity in previously published epidemiological studies. Methods: Studies that collected individual-level PFAS and anthropometric data from children up to 12 years of age were identified by searching six databases. We excluded studies that only evaluated obesity measures at the time of birth. A full-text review and quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) criteria. Forest plots were created to summarize measures of association and assess heterogeneity across studies by chemical type and exposure timing. Funnel plots were used to assess small-study effects. Results: We identified 24 studies, of which 19 used a cohort design. There were 13 studies included in the meta-analysis examining various chemicals and outcomes. Overall prenatal exposures to four different types of PFAS were not statistically associated with changes in body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference. In contrast, for three chemicals, postnatal exposures were inversely related to changes in BMI (i.e., per log10 increase in PFOS: BMI z-score of −0.16 (95% CI: −0.22, −0.10)). There was no substantial heterogeneity in the reported measures of association within prenatal and postnatal subgroups. We observed modest small-study effects, but correction for these effects using the Trim and Fill method did not change our summary estimate(s). Conclusion: Our review found no evidence of a positive association between prenatal PFAS exposure and pediatric obesity, whereas an inverse association was found for postnatal exposure. These findings should be interpreted cautiously due to the small number of studies. Future research that can inform on the effects of exposure mixtures, the timing of the exposure, outcome measures, and the shape of the exposure-response curve is needed. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Pollution caused by polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) is a significant concern. This concern has become more problematic given the rapid modification of PAHs in the environment during co-contamination to form substituted PAHs. This review aims to integrate bibliometric analysis with a rigorous study of mechanistic insights, resulting in a more comprehensive knowledge of evolving research trends on PAH remediation. The results show that research in this field has progressed over the years and peaked in 2022, potentially due to the redirection of resources toward emerging pollutants, hinting at the dynamic nature of environmental research priorities. During this year, 158,147 documents were published, representing 7 % of the total publications in the field between 2000 and 2023. The different remediation methods used for PAH remediation were identified and compared. Bioremediation, having >90 % removal efficiency, has been revealed to be the best technique because it is cost-effective and easy to operate at large scale in situ and ex-situ. The current challenges in PAH remediation have been detailed and discussed. Implementing innovative and sustainable technologies that target pollutant removal and valuable compound recovery is necessary to build a more robust future for water management. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

This systematic review analyzed studies from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to identify the molecules preferred for functionalizing silk fibroin-based dressings and to describe their mechanisms of exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. The analysis of the selected articles allowed us to classify the dressings into different conformations, such as membranes, films, hydrogels, sponges, and bioadhesives. The incorporation of various molecules, including antibiotics, natural products, peptides, nanocomposites, nanoparticles, secondary metabolites, growth factors, and cytokines, has allowed the development of dressings that promote wound healing with antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties. In addition, silk fibroin-based dressings have been established to have the potential to regenerate wounds such as venous ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic foot, third-degree burns, and neoplastic ulcers. Evaluation of the efficacy of silk fibroin-based dressings in tissue engineering is an area of great activity that has shown significant advances in recent years. © 2024 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Metals in atmospheric fine particulate matter (PM2.5) are presumed to have toxic effects. For environmental epidemiological studies, measuring the metallic components of PM2.5 collected by personal samplers and quartz fiber filters (QFF) has two key advantages: reducing exposure misclassification and enabling analyses of multiple (organic and inorganic) components on a single filter. We developed a sensitive, low-sample-consumption method to quantify the metallic components of PM2.5 collected on QFFs using micro-synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (μ-SRXRF). Teflon filter is used here as a reference to test the substrate applicability of QFF. This method requires only a 5-mm-diameter portion of a QFF and can simultaneously quantify 15 metals with atomic numbers Z = 19–34 (i.e., K–Se, excluding Sc). The analysis time for each sample was 120–360 s, and the method detection limits were 0.04–36.6 ng/m3. We validated this method by performing cross-comparisons with two external methods: offline inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and online X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The slopes of the linear fits between the μ-SRXRF and offline ICP-MS methods varied from 0.40 to 1, with R2 values ranging from 0.62 to 0.98. The slopes of the linear fits between the μ-SRXRF and online XRF methods were between 0.29 and 0.89, with R2 values ranging from 0.39 to 0.80. We applied the proposed method to analyze 391 personal PM2.5 samples collected in an epidemiological study conducted in urban Beijing. By comparing the results with the ambient concentrations from a fixed monitoring site, we found that the concentrations of some metallic components in personal PM2.5 samples were significantly different from those in the corresponding fixed-site samples, with up to an order of magnitude difference. Because personal sampling can reduce the potential for exposure misclassifications, the high-resolution temporal analysis of metallic components in personal samples using the μ-SRXRF method could be a useful approach for exploring the health risks and identifying the sources of metallic components of PM2.5. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

However, no studies have been conducted to assess their effectiveness in treating wounds after radical prostatectomy (RP). The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of FTS on RP. We went through 4 major databases. A study was conducted by PubMed, the Cochrane Library, Embase, and the Web of Science to determine the effect of comparison of FTS versus conventional surgery in RP on postoperative wound complications as of 1 July 2023. Based on the review of literature, data extraction and literature quality assessment, we conducted meta-analyses with RevMan 5.3. In the course of the study, the researchers selected 6 of the 404 studies to be analysed according to exclusion criteria. Data analysis showed that the FTS method reduced the postoperative pain associated with VAS and also decreased the rate of postoperative complications in post-surgical patients. However, there was no significant difference between FTS and conventional surgery in terms of blood loss, operation time, and postoperative infection rate. Therefore, generally speaking, FTS has less impact on postoperative complications in patients with minimal invasive prostatic cancer, but it does reduce postoperative pain and total postoperative complications. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Biochar obtained from sewage sludge serves as a valuable soil amendment in agriculture, enhancing soil properties by increasing the nutrient content, cation exchange capacity, water retention, and oxygen transmission. However, its utilisation is hampered by the presence of micropollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Previous studies indicate that the type and amount of micropollutants can be significantly adjusted by selecting the right process parameters. This literature review provides an overview of how (1) pyrolysis temperature, (2) carrier gas flow and type, (3) heating rate, and (4) residence time affect the concentration of micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge. The micropollutants targeted are those listed by the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and by the International Biochar Institution (IBI), including PAHs, PCDD/Fs, PCBs and VOCs. In addition, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are also considered due to their presence in sewage sludge. The findings suggest that higher pyrolysis temperatures reduce micropollutant levels. Moreover, the injection of a carrier gas (N2 or CO2) during the pyrolysis and cooling processes effectively lowers PAHs and PCDD/Fs, by reducing the contact of biochar with oxygen, which is crucial in mitigating micropollutants. Nevertheless, limited available data impedes an assessment of the impact of these parameters on PFAS in biochar. In addition, further research is essential to understand the effects of carrier gas type, heating rate, and residence time in order to determine the optimal pyrolysis process parameters for generating clean biochar. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

We systematically evaluate the three types of PUF-PAS sampler housings most commonly used indoors, and characterize uptake rates for > 50 SVOCs, covering legacy persistent organic pollutants, pesticides, combustion by-products, and flame retardants for all three housing types. There is a clear association between the amount of shielding of the PUF disk and equivalent air volumes for PUF-PAS, with median sampling rates for double-bowl housings of 0.72 m3/day (0.62-0.92 m3/day), 1.3 m3/day (1.0-1.7 m3/day) for single bowl, and 1.8 m3/day (1.4-2.2 m3/day) for PUFs without any housing. Combining these outcomes with a meta-analysis of existing data on PUF-PAS indoor uptake, we provide recommendations for the range of applicability and selection of sampling rates for PUF-PAS in indoor environments. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {The increasing prevalence of paraben compounds in the environment has given rise to concerns regarding their detrimental impacts on both ecosystems and human health. Over the past few decades, photocatalytic reactions have drawn significant attention as a method to accelerate the otherwise slow degradation of these pollutants. The current study aims to evaluate the current efficacy of the photocatalytic method for degrading parabens in aqueous solutions. An extensive literature review and bibliometric analysis were conducted to identify key research trends and influential areas in the field of photocatalytic paraben degradation. Studies were screened based on the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, which led to 13 studies that were identified as being appropriate for the meta-analysis using the random effects model. Furthermore, experimental parameters such as pH, paraben initial concentration, catalyst dosage, light intensity, and contact time have been reported to have key impacts on the performance of the photocatalytic degradation process. A comprehensive quantitative assessment of these parameters was carried out in this work. Overall, photocatalytic techniques could eliminate parabens with an average degradation efficiency of >80 %. The findings of the Egger's test and the Begg's test were statistically not significant suggesting potential publication bias was not observed. This review provides a holistic understanding of the photocatalytic degradation of parabens and is anticipated to encourage more widespread adoption of photocatalytic procedures as a suitable method for the elimination of parabens from aqueous solutions, opening new avenues for future research in this direction. © 2024},

	abstract = {There is currently a growing interest in the so-called emerging pollutants, such as pesticides, pharmaceuticals, personal hygiene care products, drugs, etc., whose presence in natural ecosystems is not necessarily recent, but the development in latest years of new and more sensitive methods of analysis has allowed their detection. They can be present in the natural environment, food, and many products of everyday origin, which suggests that human exposure to them is massive and universal. Therefore, the study of this type of substances is becoming one of the priority lines of research of the main agencies dedicated to the protection of public and environmental health, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) or European Union (EU). In this sense, it is of vital importance to know the nature and quantity of this type of contaminants, to establish preventive mechanisms that minimize its presence in aquatic systems, with special requirements for human consumption. This study aimed to describe a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the status of pesticides in European waters. We will search for original studies in the PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect databases. Prevalence studies of emerging contaminants (pesticides) in water resources (watersheds, aquifers, rivers, marine and springs), wastewaters (influent and effluent), and drinking water should be included. Two reviewers will independently screen and assess the included studies, with any disagreements being resolved by a third reviewer. We will summarize the findings using a narrative approach and, if possible, conduct a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). We will conduct the protocol following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The review will summarize the current evidence on the presence of pesticides in European waters such as glyphosate, chlorpyrifos, pyrethroid pesticides, neonicotinoid pesticides, and/or fungicides, in samples of different water resources like wastewaters and drinking water. We expect that this systematic review will establish preventive mechanisms that minimize the presence of pesticides in water in the environment. © 2024 Serrano Valera et al.

	abstract = {Occurrence of contaminants in water is one of the major global concerns humanity is still facing today: most of them are extremely toxic and dangerous for human health, obliging their removal for a proper and correct process of sanitation. Among wastewater treatment technologies, in the view of development of sustainable and environmentally friendly processes, membrane adsorption has proved to be a fast and simple method in the removal of pollutants, offering great contaminants recovery percentages, fast adsorbent regeneration and recycle, and easy scale-up. Due to their large surface area and tunable chemistry, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-based materials revealed to be extraordinary adsorbents, exceeding by far performances of ordinary organic and inorganic membranes such as polyethersulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride, polytetrafluoroethylene, ceramics, currently employed in membrane technologies for wastewater treatment. In consideration of this, the review aims to summarize recent developments in the field of carbon nanotubes-based materials for pollutants recovery from water through adsorption processes. After a brief introduction concerning what adsorption phenomenon is and how it is performed and governed by using carbon nanotubes-based materials, the review discusses into detail the employment of three common typologies of CNTs-based materials (CNTs powders, CNTs-doped polymeric membranes and CNTs membranes) in adsorption process for the removal of water pollutants. Particularly focus will be devoted on the emergent category of self-standing CNTs membranes (buckypapers), made entirely of carbon nanotubes, exhibiting superior performances than CNTs and CNTs-doped polymeric membranes in terms of preparation strategy, recovery percentages of pollutants and regeneration possibilities. The extremely encouraging results presented in this review aim to support and pave the way to the introduction of alternative and more efficient pathways in wastewater treatment technologies to contrast the problem of water pollution. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs), as emerging pollutants, have attracted the attention of environmentalists, statespersons, and the scientific community over the last few decades. To address the spread of MPs in the environment, it is imperative to develop various removal techniques and materials that are effective, scalable, and ecologically benign. However, to the best of our knowledge, no review has systematically examined the removal of MPs using adsorption or provided an in-depth discussion on various adsorbents. Adsorption is an inexpensive and effective technology for wastewater treatment. Recently, many researchers have conducted studies on MP remediation using diverse adsorbent materials, such as biochar, activated carbon, sponges, carbon nanotubes, metal-layered oxides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and zeolites. Each adsorbent has advantages and disadvantages. To overcome their disadvantages, researchers have been designing and developing hybrid adsorbents for MP remediation. This review provides insights into these individual adsorbents and also discusses hybrid adsorbents for MP removal. Finally, the review elaborates on future possibilities and ways to enable more efficient, scalable, and environmentally friendly MP cleanup. Overall, this review bridges the gap between contemporary MP remediation using adsorption techniques and adsorbent development. © 2024},

	abstract = {Background: Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are chemicals characterized by their environmental persistence. Evidence suggests that exposure to POPs, which is ubiquitous, is associated with microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. miRNA are key regulators in many physiological processes. It is thus of public health concern to understand the relationships between POPs and miRNA as related to health outcomes. Objectives: This systematic review evaluated the relationship between widely recognized, intentionally manufactured, POPs, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB]), with miRNA expression in both human and animal studies. Methods: We used PubMed and Embase to systematically search the literature up to September 29th, 2023. Search results for human and animal studies were included if they incorporated at least one POP of interest in relation to at least one miRNA. Data were synthesized to determine the direction and significance of associations between POPs and miRNA. We utilized ingenuity pathway analysis to review disease pathways for miRNA that were associated with POPs. Results: Our search identified 38 eligible studies: 9 in humans and 29 in model organisms. PFAS were associated with decreased expression of miR-19, miR-193b, and miR-92b, as well as increased expression of miR-128, miR-199a-3p, and miR-26b across species. PCBs were associated with increased expression of miR-15a, miR-1537, miR-21, miR-22-3p, miR-223, miR-30b, and miR-34a, as well as decreased expression of miR-130a and let-7b in both humans and animals. Pathway analysis for POP-associated miRNA identified pathways related to carcinogenesis. Discussion: This is the first systematic review of the association of POPs with miRNA in humans and model organisms.

	abstract = {Background Chronic airway diseases have been associated with an increased risk of tuberculosis (TB); however, data in patients with bronchiectasis is limited. Statins have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the inflammatory response. This study investigated whether statin treatment could reduce the risk of TB in patients with bronchiectasis. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide population database of patients with bronchiectasis who did or did not receive statin treatment. The defined daily dose (DDD) of statin, current or past statin user and statin exposure time were measured for the impact of statin use. The primary outcome was the incidence of new-onset TB. Considering of potential immortal time bias due to stain exposure time, Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates were employed to estimate HRs with 95% CIs for TB incidence among patients with bronchiectasis. Results Patients with bronchiectasis receiving statin treatment had a decreased risk of TB. After adjusting for age, sex, income, comorbidities and Charlson Comorbidity Index, statin users had a 0.59-fold lower risk of TB incidence compared with non-statin users (95% CI 0.40 to 0.88; p=0.0087). Additionally, compared with non-statin users, statin treatment was a protective factor against TB in users with a cumulative DDD greater than 180 per year, with an HR of 0.32 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.87; p=0.0255). Conclusions Statin treatment demonstrated a dose-dependent protective effect and was associated with a reduced risk of TB in patients with bronchiectasis. These findings suggest that statins may play a role in lowering TB risk by modulating airway inflammation in this patient population. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.},

	abstract = {Polystyrene microplastics (MPs) are persistent environmental pollutants commonly encountered in daily human life. Numerous studies have demonstrated their ability to induce liver damage, including oxidative stress, inflammation, and lipid accumulation. However, limited information exists regarding preventive measures against this issue. In our study, we investigated the potential preventive role of selenium nanoparticles (YC-3-SeNPs) derived from Yak-derived Bacillus cereus, a novel nanobiomaterial known for its antioxidant properties and lipid metabolism regulation. Using transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified key genes and metabolites associated with oxidative stress and lipid metabolism imbalance induced by MPs. Upregulated genes (Scd1, Fasn, Irs2, and Lpin) and elevated levels of arachidonic and palmitic acid accumulation were observed in MP-exposed mice, but not in those exposed to SeNPs. Further experiments confirmed that SeNPs significantly attenuated liver lipid accumulation and degeneration caused by MPs. Histological results and pathway screening validated our findings, revealing that MPs suppressed the Pparα pathway and Nrf2 pathway, whereas SeNPs activated both pathways. These findings suggest that MPs may contribute to the development of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), while SeNPs hold promise as a future nanobio-product for its prevention. © 2024},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals that have been linked to increased risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) and may affect glucose metabolisms during pregnancy. We examined the associations between maternal PFAS exposure and maternal glucose metabolisms and GDM risk among 1601 mothers who joined the Hyperglycaemia-and-Adverse-Pregnancy-Outcome (HAPO) Study in Hong Kong in 2001–2006. All mothers underwent a 75 g-oral-glucose-tolerance test at 24–32 weeks of gestation. We measured serum concentrations of six PFAS biomarkers using high-performance liquid-chromatography-coupled-with-tandem-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). We fitted conventional and advanced models (quantile-g-computation [qgcomp] and Bayesian-kernel machine regression [BKMR]) to assess the associations of individual and a mixture of PFAS with glycaemic traits. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the enrollment period by the severe-acute-respiratory-syndrome (SARS) epidemic periods in Hong Kong between March 2003 and May 2004. PFOS and PFOA were the main components of PFAS mixture among 1601 pregnant women in the Hong Kong HAPO study, with significantly higher median PFOS concentrations (19.09 ng/mL), compared to Chinese pregnant women (9.40 ng/mL) and US women (5.27 ng/mL). Maternal exposure to PFAS mixture was associated with higher HbA1c in the qgcomp (β = 0.04, 95 % CI: 0.01–0.06) model. We did not observe significant associations of PFAS mixture with fasting plasma glucose (PG), 1-h and 2-h PG in either model, except for 2-h PG in the qgcmop model (β = 0.074, 95 % CI: 0.01–0.15). PFOS was the primary contributor to the overall positive effects on HbA1c. Epidemic-specific analyses showed specific associations between PFAS exposure and the odds of GDM in the pre-SARS epidemic period. The median concentration of PFOS was highest during the peri-SARS epidemic (21.2 [14.5–43.6] ng/mL) compared with the pre-SARS (12.3 [9.2–19.9] ng/mL) and post-SARS (20.3 [14.2–46.3] ng/mL) epidemic periods. Potential interactions and exposure-response relationships between PFOA and PFNA with elevated HbA1c were observed in the peri-SARS period in BKMR model. Maternal exposure to PFAS mixture was associated with altered glucose metabolism during pregnancy. SARS epidemic-specific associations call for further studies on its long-term adverse health effects, especially potential modified associations by lifestyle changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Objective: The purpose of the current study is to synthesize the outcomes of investigations reporting the odds of lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD) in competitive swimmers compared to controls. Literature Survey: PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines from inception until March 2023 to identify relevant studies evaluating the risk for lumbar DDD associated with swimming. Methods: Data in the current literature were synthesized for positive imaging findings of DDD at one or more lumbar level in swimmers compared to nonswimmers. Additionally, data regarding prevalence of lumbar disc degeneration and back pain in competitive swimmers were synthesized. Synthesis: Four studies were included in the final analysis. Study quality and risk of bias were deemed adequate. There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 0.74) regarding data collected, population of swimmers, sample size, and methods. Therefore, a meta-analysis was not conducted. The majority of the studies included in this study (three of four) reported that swimmers have increased odds of developing lumbar DDD. Additionally, secondary outcome analysis indicated that swimmers have a higher probability of developing moderate-to-severe back pain. Conclusion: Competitive swimming appears to be associated with the presence of DDD on advanced imaging and moderate-to-severe back pain. These findings are limited by significant differences in study methodology in the included studies. Although swimming is conventionally considered a low-impact sport, elite swimmers risk developing lower back pain and disc pathology, possibly because training involves unique biomechanics with repetitive rotational and hyperextension/flexion of the spine. Further research investigating risk factors involving biomechanics of swimming on the spine may have important implications for stroke technique, injury prevention, and rehabilitation for swimmers. © 2024 American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation.},

	abstract = {Following its introduction as an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid, hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (HFPO-DA) has been extensively detected in various environmental matrices. Despite this prevalence, limited information is available regarding its hepatotoxicity biomarkers. In this study, toxicokinetic simulations indicated that under repeated treatment, HFPO-DA in mice serum reached a steady state by the 4th day. To assess its subacute hepatic effects and identify potential biomarkers, mice were administered HFPO-DA orally at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 12.5, or 62.5 mg/kg/d for 7 d. Results revealed that the lowest observed adverse effect levels were 0.5 mg/kg/d for hepatomegaly and 2.5 mg/kg/d for hepatic injury. Serum metabolomics analysis identified 34, 58, and 118 differential metabolites in the 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mg/kg/d groups, respectively, compared to the control group. Based on weighted gene coexpression network analysis, eight potential hepatotoxicity-related metabolites were identified; among them, kynurenic acid (KA) in mouse serum exhibited the highest correlation with liver injury. Furthermore, liver-targeted metabolomics analysis demonstrated that HFPO-DA exposure induced metabolic migration of the kynurenine pathway from KA to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, resulting in the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway. Notably, pretreatment with KA significantly attenuated liver injury induced by HFPO-DA exposure in mice, highlighting the pivotal roles of KA in the hepatotoxicity of HFPO-DA. © 2024 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Chromium and organochlorine solvents, particularly trichloroethene (TCE), are pervasive co-existing contaminants in subsurface aquifers due to their extensive industrial use and improper disposal practices. In this study, we investigated the microbial dechlorination kinetics under different TCE-Cr(Ⅲ/VI) composite pollution conditions and elucidated microbial response mechanisms based on community shift patterns and metagenomic analysis. Our results revealed that the reductive dechlorinating consortium had high resistance to Cr(III) but extreme sensitivity to Cr(VI) disturbance, resulting in a persistent inhibitory effect on subsequent dechlorination. Interestingly, the vinyl chloride-respiring organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) was notably more susceptible to Cr(III/VI) exposure than the trichloroethene-respiring one, possibly due to inferior competition for growth substrates, such as electron donors. In terms of synergistic non-OHRB populations, Cr(III/VI) exposure had limited impacts on lactate fermentation but significantly interfered with H2-producing acetogenesis, leading to inhibited microbial dechlorination due to electron donor deficiencies. However, this inhibition can be effectively mitigated by the amendment of exogenous H2 supply. Furthermore, being the predominant OHRB, Dehalococcoides have inherent Cr(VI) resistance defects and collaborate with synergistic non-OHRB populations to achieve concurrent bio-detoxication of Cr(VI) and TCE. Our findings expand the understanding of the response patterns of different functional populations towards Cr(III/VI) stress, and provide valuable insights for the development of in situ bioremediation strategies for sites co-contaminated with chloroethene and chromium. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The growing concerns over food safety and pollutants, especially emerging contaminants like microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in aquatic environments, have attracted considerable research attention. This paper provides a comprehensive review of MPs, heavy metals, antibiotics, and ARGs within Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), exploring their occurrence, characteristics, sources, impacts, removal strategies, and interactions. MPs are found in varying concentrations in RAS, especially in fish tissues, raising concerns about fish health. Heavy metals in RAS, originating from feed, pipe corrosion, and make-up water, accumulate, posing risks to fish and necessitating stringent control measures. Antibiotics persist in RAS water and sediment, contributing to ARGs, posing a threat to both fish and human health. Research gaps persist in the removal of MPs, efficient heavy metals control, and addressing antibiotics and ARGs pollution in RAS. Controlling MPs is crucial due to their role as ideal carriers, potential reservoirs, and hotspots for other pollutants, emphasizing the need for comprehensive approaches to mitigate environmental and health risks. The field encounters notable challenges but presents promising avenues for future research in RAS. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), a widely used brominated flame retardant in electronics manufacturing, has caused global contamination due to improper e-waste disposal. Its persistence, bioaccumulation, and potential carcinogenicity drive studies of its transformation and underlying (a)biotic interactions. This study achieved an anaerobic enrichment culture capable of reductively dehalogenating TBBPA to the more bioavailable bisphenol A. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR confirmed that successive dehalogenation of four bromide ions from TBBPA was coupled with the growth of both Dehalobacter sp. and Dehalococcoides sp. with growth yields of 5.0 ± 0.4 × 108 and 8.6 ± 4.6 × 108 cells per μmol Br- released (N = 3), respectively. TBBPA dehalogenation was facilitated by solid humin and reduced humin, which possessed the highest organic radical signal intensity and reducing groups −NH2, and maintained the highest dehalogenation rate and dehalogenator copies. Genome-centric metatranscriptomic analyses revealed upregulated putative TBBPA-dehalogenating rdhA (reductive dehalogenase) genes with humin amendment, cprA-like Dhb_rdhA1 gene in Dehalobacter species, and Dhc_rdhA1/Dhc_rdhA2 genes in Dehalococcoides species. The upregulated genes of lactate fermentation, de novo corrinoid biosynthesis, and extracellular electron transport in the humin amended treatment also stimulated TBBPA dehalogenation.

	abstract = {The global warming and other environmental problems caused by SF6 emissions can be reduced due to the widespread use of eco-friendly insulating gas, perfluoropentanone (C5F10O). However, there is an exposure risk to populations in areas near C5F10O equipment, so it is important to clarify its biosafety and pathogenesis before large-scale application. In this paper, histopathology, transcriptomics, 4D-DIA proteomics, and LC-MS metabolomics of rats exposed to 2000 ppm and 6000 ppm C5F10O are analyzed to reveal the mechanisms of toxicity and health risks. Histopathological shows that inflammatory cell infiltration, epithelial cell hyperplasia, and alveolar atrophy accompanied by alveolar wall thickening are present in both low-dose and high-dose groups. Analysis of transcriptomic and 4D-DIA proteomic show that Cell cycle and DNA replication can be activated by both 2000 ppm and 6000 ppm C5F10O to induce cell proliferation. In addition, it also leads to the activation of pathways such as Antigen processing and presentation, Cell adhesion molecules and Complement and coagulation cascades, T cell receptor signal path, Th1 and T cell receptor signal path, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, complement and coagulation cascades. Finally, LC-MS metabolomics analysis confirms that the metabolic pathways associated with glycerophospholipids, arachidonic acid, and linoleic acid are disrupted and become more severe with increasing doses. The mechanism of lung toxicity caused by C5F10O is systematically expounded based on the multi-omics analysis and provided biosafety references for further promotion and application of C5F10O. © 2024},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bufei Huoxue capsule (BHC) as a classic Chinese patent medicine formula, has the efficacy of tonifying the lungs and activating the blood. It has been extensively used in China for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) clinically. However, its mechanism is still unclear, which hampers the applications of BHC in treating COPD. Aim of the study: The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the protective efficacy and mechanism of BHC on COPD model rats by integrating serum metabolomics analysis and network pharmacology study. Materials and methods: A COPD rat model was established by cigarette fumigation combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) airway drip for 90 consecutive days. After oral administration for 30 days, the rats were placed in the body tracing box of the EMKA Small Animal Noninvasive Lung Function Test System to determine lung function related indexes. Histopathological alteration was observed by H&E staining and Masson staining. The serum levels of inflammatory cytokine, matrix metalloprotein 9, and laminin were determined by ELISA kits. Oxidative stress levels were tested by biochemical methods. UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis of serum metabolomics and network pharmacology were performed to reveal the bioactive metabolites, key components and pathways for BHC treating COPD. WB and ELISA kits were used to verify the effects of BHC on key pathway. Results: BHC could improve lung function, immunity, lung histopathological changes and collagen deposition in COPD model rats. It also could significantly reduce inflammatory response in vivo, regulate oxidative stress level, reduce laminin content, and regulate protease-antiprotease balance. Metabolomics analysis found 46 biomarkers of COPD, of which BHC significantly improved the levels of 23 differential metabolites including arachidonic acid, leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2. Combined with the results of network pharmacology, the components of BHC, such as calycosin, oxypaeoniflora, (S)-bavachin and neobavaisoflavone could play therapeutic roles through the arachidonic acid pathway. In addition, the results of WB and ELISA indicated that BHC could suppress the expressions of COX2 and 5-LOX in lung tissues and inhibit the generation of AA and its metabolites in serum samples. Regulation of arachidonic acid metabolic pathway may be the crucial mechanism for BHC treating COPD. Conclusions: In summary, the studies indicated that BHC exhibited the protective effect on COPD model rats by anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties through arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. This study provided beneficial support for the applications of BHC in treating COPD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {6:2 Fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), one of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), is widely used as a raw material in synthesizing surfactants and fluorinated polymers. However, little is known about the role of root exudates on 6:2 FTOH biodegradation in the rhizosphere. This study examined the effects of root exudates produced from dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) and monocot (Brachypodium distachyon) grown under different nutrient conditions (nutrient-rich, sulfur-free, and potassium-free) on 6:2 FTOH biotransformation with or without bioaugmentating agent Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. All the exudates enhanced defluorination of 6:2 FTOH by glucose-grown RHA1. Amendment of dicot or monocot root exudates, regardless of the plant growth conditions, also enhanced 6:2 FTOH biotransformation in soil microcosms. Interestingly, high levels of humic-like substances in the root exudates are linked to high extents of 6:2 FTOH defluorination. Bioaugmenting strain RHA1 along with root exudates facilitated 6:2 FTOH transformation with a production of more diverse metabolites. Microbial community analysis revealed that Rhodococcus was predominant in all strain RHA1 spiked treatments. Different root exudates changed the soil microbiome dynamics. This study provided new insight into 6:2 FTOH biotransformation with different root exudates, suggesting that root exudates amendment and bioaugmentation are promising approaches to promote rhizoremediation for PFAS-contaminated soil. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The global climate change events are expected to augment the vulnerability of persistent organic pollutants within the global brownfield areas to a certain extent, consequently heightening the risk crises faced by these brownfields amidst the backdrop of global environmental changes. However, studies addressing brownfield risks from the perspective of climate change have received limited attention. Nonetheless, the detrimental consequences of brownfield risks are intrinsically linked to strategies for mitigating and adapting to sustainable urban development, emphasizing the critical importance of their far-reaching implications. This relevance extends to concerns about environmental quality, safety, health risks, and the efficacy of chosen regeneration strategies, including potential secondary pollution risks. This comprehensive review systematically surveys pertinent articles published between 1998 and 2023. A selective analysis was conducted on 133 articles chosen for their thematic relevance. The findings reveal that: (1) Under the backdrop of the climate change process, brownfield restoration is necessitated to provide scientific and precise guidance. The integration of brownfield considerations with the dynamics of climate change has progressively evolved into a unified framework, gradually shaping a research paradigm characterized by “comprehensive + multi-scale + quantitative” methodologies; (2) Research themes coalesce into five prominent clusters: “Aggregation of Brownfield Problem Analysis”, “Precision Enhancement of Brownfield Identification through Information Technology”, “Diversification of Brownfield Reutilization Assessment”, “Process-Oriented Approaches to Brownfield Restoration Strategies”, and “Expansion of Ecological Service Functions in Brownfield Contexts”; (3) Application methodologies encompass five key facets: “Temporal and Spatial Distribution Patterns of Pollutants”, “Mechanisms and Correlations of Pollution Effects”, “Evaluation of Pollution Risks”, “Assessment of Brownfield Restoration Strategies”, and “Integration of Brownfield Regeneration with Spatial Planning”. Future brownfield research from the climate change perspective is poised to reflect characteristics such as “High-Precision Prediction, Comprehensive Dimensionality, Full-Cycle Evaluation, Low-Risk Exposure, and Commitment to Sustainable Development”. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Context: Kefir consumption has been associated with immune response modulation, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory effects. Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the role of kefir against inflammation and the main response mechanisms involved in this process in a murine model. Data Sources: The searches were searched in the PubMed, Science Direct, and LILACS databases. Only murine model studies, according to PRISMA guidelines, published in the past 10 years were included. Study Selection: Only articles about original and placebo-controlled experiments in murine models used to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of kefir were considered. Of the articles found, 349 were excluded according to the following criteria: duplicate articles (n = 99), off-Topic title and abstract (n = 157), reviews (n = 47), studies in vitro (n = 29), and studies with humans (n = 17). In total, 23 studies were included in this review. Data Extraction: Two independently working authors assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. Results: Kefir consumption had positive effects on inflammation modulation. The main mechanisms involved were the reduction of pro-inflammatory and molecular markers; reduction in inflammatory infiltrate in tissues, serum biomarkers, risk factors for chronic diseases, and parasitic infection; composition and metabolic activity change of intestinal microbiota and mycobiota; activation of humoral and cellular immunity; and modulation of oxidative stress. Conclusions: Kefir modulates the immune system in different experimental models, among other secondary outcomes, to improve overall health. The beverage reduces inflammation through the alternation between innate, Th1, and Th2 responses, reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing those of anti-inflammatory ones. In addition, it also mediates immunomodulatory and protective effects through the numerous molecular biomarkers and organic acids produced and secreted by kefir in the intestinal microbiota. The health-promoting effects attributed to kefir may help in the different treatments of inflammatory, chronic, and infectious diseases in the population.  © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Various persistent organic pollutants (POPs) including estrogens are often enriched in mangrove regions. This research investigated the estrogens pollution levels in six mangroves located in the Southern China. The estrogen levels were found to be in the range of 5.3–24.9 ng/g dry weight, suggesting that these mangroves had been seriously contaminated. The bacterial communities under estrogen stress were further enriched by supplementing 17β-estradiol (E2) as the sole carbon source. The enriched bacterial communities showed an excellent E2 degradation capacity > 95 %. These communities were able to transform E2 into estrone (E1), 4-hydroxy-estrone, and keto-estrone, etc. 16 S rDNA sequencing and metagenomics analysis revealed that bacterial taxa Oleiagrimonas, Pseudomonas, Terrimonas, and Nitratireductor etc. were the main contributors to estrogen degradation. Moreover, the genes involved in E2 degradation were enriched in the microbial communities, including the genes encoding 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, estrone 4-hydroxylase, etc. Finally, the analyses of functional genes and binning genomes demonstrated that E2 was degraded by bacterial communities via dehydrogenation into E1 by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. E1 was then catabolically converted to 3aα-H-4α(3′-propanoate)− 7aβ-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione via 4,5-seco pathway. Alternatively, E1 could also be hydroxylated to keto-estrone, followed by B-ring cleavage. This study provides novel insights into the biodegradation of E2 by the bacterial communities in estrogen-contaminated mangroves. © 2023},

	abstract = {Biochar is a biomass product submitted to the pyrolysis process, under high temperatures and absence of oxygen. It is a material that has a low cost production and vast options of applicability, among the most explored are: recovery of soils degraded by agricultural activities and sorption of contaminants through the bioremediation of polluted areas. Thus, this material aims to demonstrate the production and characterization of biochar, and discuss its applications for soil improvement and reduction of the concentration of toxic and harmful substances, such as textile dyes and heavy metals, improperly disposed of in the environment, all this from the selection of relevant references that address clearly and consistently the application of biochar and its effects. From the analyzed works it was found that biochar exerts a high sorption power of a variety of emerging pollutants, such as: pharmaceuticals, pesticides, textile dyes and heavy metals, retaining, in some applications, up to 90% of the original concentration of the contaminant. Furthermore, biochar is one of the main alternatives for the recovery of soils exploited for long periods as cultivated or pasture areas, obtaining, for the vast majority of biochar applications, the improvement of soil properties, such as: pH, nutrient retention and carbon content. Therefore, biochar is a carbonaceous material with high productive viability and great efficiency in bioremediation processes and recovery of degraded areas. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

	abstract = {Heavy metal pollution has become a grave environmental problem drawing worldwide attention. Reclamation of polluted land using innovative and ecofriendly way is crucial to restore soil fertility. During the past two decades, various approaches of bio-/phytoremediation are gaining their acceptance to remediate contaminated soil. Recently, the use of reactive nanomaterials for phytoremediation or ‘nano-phytoremediation’ is becoming popular, claiming to improve the phyto-availability of heavy metals and reduce their toxicity through transformation or detoxification. Nanomaterials exhibit distinct properties concerning size, shape, reactivity, and ratio of surface area to volume rendering their potential for a range of applications including remediation of polluted soil environments with heavy metals, chlorinated organic solvents, organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and polychlorinated biphenyls. Further, the combination of plants and associated microbes such as rhizospheric bacteria or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has the potential to significantly improve the nano-phytoremediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. This review focuses on recent developments on nano-phytoremediation, plant root associated microbes, and their interaction for developing an integrated and efficient nano-phytoremediation strategy for improved soil remediation in general and for soil contaminated with heavy metal. The application of nanomaterials combined with phytoremediation was discussed. © The Author(s) under exclusive licence to Iranian Society of Environmentalists (IRSEN) and Science and Research Branch, Islamic Azad University 2024.},

	abstract = {Brilliant, diverse colour ornaments of birds were one of the crucial cues that led Darwin to the idea of sexual selection. Although avian colouration plays many functions, including concealment, thermoregulation, or advertisement as a distasteful prey, a quality-signalling role in sexual selection has attracted most research attention. Sexually selected ornaments are thought to be more susceptible to external stressors than naturally selected traits, and as such, they might be used as a test for environmental quality. For this reason, the last two decades have seen numerous studies on the impact of anthropogenic pollution on the expression of various avian colour traits. Herein, we provide the first meta-analytical summary of these results and examine whether there is an interaction between the mechanism of colour production (carotenoid-based, melanin-based and structural) and the type of anthropogenic factor (categorised as heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, urbanisation, or other). Following the assumption of heightened condition dependence of ornaments under sexual selection, we also expected the magnitude of effect sizes to be higher in males. The overall effect size was close to significance and negative, supporting a general detrimental impact of anthropogenic pollutants on avian colouration. In contrast to expectations, there was no interaction between pollution types and colour-producing mechanisms. Yet there were significant differences in sensitivity between colour-producing mechanisms, with carotenoid-based colouration being the most affected by anthropogenic environmental disturbances. Moreover, we observed no significant tendency towards heightened sensitivity in males. We identified a publication gap on structural colouration, which, compared to pigment-based colouration, remains markedly understudied and should thus be prioritised in future research. Finally, we call for the unification of methods used in colour quantification in ecological research to ensure comparability of results among studies. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Plants play a vital role in the phytoremediation process, attenuating various pollutants. However, the dynamic root uptake and fate of emerging pollutants in plants, along with their effects on plant characteristics, have received limited research attention. This study explores the potential of Chrysopogon zizanioides (Vetiver) and Colocasia esculenta (Taro) in mitigating pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs) - metronidazole (MNZ), naproxen (NAP), and methylparaben (MeP), under hydroponic conditions. Both plants demonstrated similar specific uptake potentials for the target pollutants (5.23 to 5.76 mg/g of biomass dry weight), with pollutant accumulation in plants remaining very low (<10 %). Notably, a substantial fraction of pollutants (66.27 % to 78.42 %) underwent metabolism. Qualitative analysis identified five MNZ and NAP metabolites and six MeP metabolites in plant tissues. Over a 28-day PPCPs exposure, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulted in reduced chlorophyll content, root activity, protein, and carbohydrates, alongside increased oxidative stress levels. The study highlighted distinct accumulation patterns, with NAP (anion) primarily in roots and MeP (cation) and MNZ (neutral) predominantly in aerial parts. Phloroglucinol staining confirmed the intact endodermis (Casparian Strips) in Vetiver roots, indicating symplastic transport of PPCPs to aerial parts. Moreover, significant morphological alterations were observed in plant roots exposed to target pollutants. During recuperation, a decrease in accumulated ROS indicates partial self-recovery from oxidative damage. In conclusion, both Vetiver and Taro emerge as promising candidates for removing specified PPCPs, emphasizing the critical role of addressing emerging contaminants for sustainable development and preserving the environment and human wellbeing. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: A macula-involving rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) is one of the most common ophthalmic surgical emergencies and causes significant visual morbidity. Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is often performed to repair primary macula-involving RRDs with a high rate of anatomical retinal reattachment. It has been advocated by some ophthalmologists that face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade helps reduce postoperative retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause metamorphopsia and binocular diplopia. Objectives: The primary objective of this review is to determine whether face-down positioning reduces the risk of retinal displacement following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2022, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1946 to 28 November 2022), Embase.com (January 1947 to 28 November 2022), PubMed (1948 to 28 November 2022), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (1982 to 28 November 2022), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 November 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which face-down positioning was compared with no positioning or another form of positioning following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the prespecified outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results: We identified three RCTs (369 eyes of 368 participants) that met the eligibility criteria. Two RCTs provided data on postoperative retinal displacement, one reported on postoperative distortion and quality of life outcomes, two on postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in logMAR, and two on postoperative ocular adverse events such as outer retinal folds. Study characteristics and risk of bias. All the trials involved predominantly male participants (range: 68% to 72%). Only one trial provided race and ethnicity information, was registered on a trial registry, and reported funding sources. Using the RoB 2 tool, we assessed the risk of bias for proportion of eyes with retinal displacement, mean change in visual acuity, objective distortion scores, quality of life assessments, and ocular adverse events, with most domains judged to be at low risk of bias. Findings. Immediate face-down positioning may result in a lower proportion of participants with postoperative retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning at six months (risk ratio [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 0.99; 1 RCT; 239 eyes of 239 participants; very low certainty evidence). One study found no evidence of a difference in BCVA at three months when comparing postoperative face-up with face-down positioning with or without perfluorocarbon liquid (mean difference [MD] −0.03, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.02; I2 = 0; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). Immediate face-down positioning appears to have little to no effect on postoperative distortion scores at week 26 (MD 1.80, 95% CI −1.92 to 5.52; 1 RCT; 219 eyes of 219 participants; very low certainty evidence) and postoperative quality of life assessment scores at week 26 (MD −1.80, 95% CI −5.52 to 1.92; 1 RCT; 217 eyes of 217 participants; very low certainty evidence). Adverse events. One study that enrolled 262 participants with macula-involving RRDs suggested that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may reduce the ocular adverse event of postoperative outer retinal folds at six months (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) and binocular diplopia (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) compared with support-the-break positioning. Immediate face-down positioning may increase the ocular adverse event of elevated intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence). Another study found no evidence of a difference in postoperative outer retinal folds when comparing face-down versus face-up positioning at one and three months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.02; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.61; 1 RCT; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). No studies reported non-ocular adverse events. Authors' conclusions: Very low certainty evidence suggests that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may result in a reduction in postoperative retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of postoperative raised intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning at six months. We identified two ongoing trials that compare face-down positioning with face-up positioning following PPV and gas tamponade in participants with primary macula-involving RRDs, whose results may provide relevant evidence for our stated objectives. Future trials should be rigorously designed, and investigators should analyze outcome data appropriately and report adequate information to provide evidence of high certainty. Quality of life and patient preferences should be examined in addition to clinical and adverse event outcomes.  Copyright © 2024 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Methodology: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in France to recruit women with and without surgically confirmed deep endometriosis. Women's serum was analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to measure the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) and per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). A comprehensive metabolomic profiling was conducted using targeted HRMS and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) to cover polar and non-polar fractions. A “meet-in-the-middle” statistical framework was applied to identify the metabolites related to endometriosis and POP levels, using multivariate linear and logistic regressions adjusting for confounding variables. Results: Fourteen PCBs, six OCPs and six PFAS were widely found in almost all serum samples. The pesticide trans-nonachlor was the POP most strongly and positively associated with deep endometriosis risk, with odds ratio (95 % confidence interval) of 2.42 (1.49; 4.12), followed by PCB180 and 167. Women with endometriosis exhibited a distinctive metabolic profile, with elevated serum levels of lactate, ketone bodies and multiple amino acids and lower levels of bile acids, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), cortisol and hippuric acid. The metabolite 2-hydroxybutyrate was simultaneously associated to endometriosis risk and exposure to trans-nonachlor. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive metabolome-wide association study of endometriosis, integrating ultra-trace profiling of POPs. The results confirmed a metabolic alteration among women with deep endometriosis that could be also associated to the exposure to POPs. Further observational and experimental studies will be required to delineate the causal ordering of those associations and gain insight on the underlying mechanisms. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants in the environment. While some studies suggest that PFASs may contribute to cancer development, the link between PFAS exposure and cancer risk remains debated. Methods: This dose-response meta-analysis explores the relationship between PFASs and cancer. It employs odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD), along with their 95% confidence interval (CI), to assess the effects of PFASs on cancer risk. Relevant studies were sourced from Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Medline, and CNKI databases. The dose-response relationship was assessed by the fixed-effects model and least-squares regression. Results: Forty studies, involving a total of 748,188 participants, were included in this meta-analysis. Out of these, 13 studies were specifically analyzed for the dose-response relationship. Findings revealed that exposure to PFASs, especially PFDA, significantly raises the risk of genitourinary cancers, and PFDA exposure shows a dose-dependent increase in overall and breast cancer risk. Additionally, PFOS exposure is associated with an increased cancer risk, and elevated PFOA levels were significantly observed in breast cancer patients. Conclusions: The findings suggest that PFAS exposure is a potential cancer risk factor, with the carcinogenic potential of PFDA being dose-dependent. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Tehran University of Medical Sciences 2024.},

	abstract = {Study Design: Systematic review Objective: Examine the clinical evidence for the use of osteobiologics in hybrid surgery (combined anterior cervical discectomy and fusion (ACDF) and total disc replacement (TDR)) in patients with multilevel cervical degenerative disc disease (DDD). Methods: PubMed and Embase were searched between January 2000 and August 2020. Clinical studies investigating 18-80 year old patients with multilevel cervical DDD who underwent hybrid surgery with or without the use of osteobiologics were considered eligible. Two reviewers independently screened and assessed the identified articles. The methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS) tool and the risk of bias (RoB 2.0) assessment tool were used to assess risk of bias. The Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluations (GRADE) was used to evaluate quality of evidence across studies per outcome. Results: Eleven studies were included. A decrease in cervical range of motion was observed in most studies for both the hybrid surgery and the control groups consisting of stand-alone ACDF or TDR. Fusion rates of 70-100% were reported in both the hybrid surgery and control groups consisting of stand-alone ACDF. The hybrid surgery group performed better or comparable to the control group in terms of adjacent segment degeneration. Studies reported an improvement in visual analogue scale for pain and neck disability index values after surgery compared to preoperative scores for both treatment groups. The included studies had moderate methodological quality. Conclusions: There is insufficient evidence for assessing the use of osteobiologics in multilevel hybrid surgery and additional high quality and controlled research is deemed essential. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The increasing socioeconomic need for optimal treatment of hip fractures in combination with the high diversity of available implants has raised numerous biomechanical questions. This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of biomechanical research on the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures using cephalomedullary devices. Methods: Following the PRISMA-P guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed on 31.12.2022. The databases PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched. Scientific papers published between 01.01.2000 – 31.12.2022 were included when they reported data on implant properties related to the biomechanical stability for intertrochanteric fractures. Data extraction was undertaken using a synthesis approach, gathering data on criteria of implants, sample size, fracture type, bone material, and study results. Results: The initial search identified a total of 1459 research papers, out of which forty-three papers were considered for final analysis. Due to the heterogeneous methods and parameters used in the included studies, meta-analysis was not feasible. A comprehensive assessment of implant characteristics and outcome parameters was conducted through biomechanical analysis. Various factors such as proximal and distal locking, nail diameter and length, fracture model, and bone material were thoroughly evaluated. Conclusion: This scoping review highlights the need for standardization in biomechanical studies on intertrochanteric fractures to ensure reliable and comparable results. Strategies such as avoiding varus, maintaining a sufficient tip-apex-distance, cement augmentation, and optimizing lesser trochanteric osteosynthesis enhance construct stability. Synthetic alternatives may offer advantages over cadaveric bone. Further research and meta-analyses are required to establish standardized protocols and enhance reliability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Indoor air quality is of major concern for human health and well-being. Nitrous acid (HONO) is an emerging indoor pollutant, and its indoor mixing ratios are usually higher than outdoor levels, ranging from a few to tens of parts per billion (ppb). HONO exhibits adverse effects to human health due to its respiratory toxicity and mutagenicity. Additionally, HONO can easily undergo photodissociation by ultraviolet light to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH•), which in turn trigger a series of further photochemical oxidation reactions of primary or secondary pollutants. The accumulation of indoor HONO can be attributed to both direct emissions from combustion sources, such as cooking, and secondary formation resulting from enhanced heterogeneous reactions of NOx on indoor surfaces. During the day, the primary sink of indoor HONO is photolysis to OH• and NO. Moreover, adsorption and/or reaction on indoor surfaces, and diffusion to the outside atmosphere contribute to HONO loss both during the day and at night. The level of indoor HONO is also affected by human occupancy, which can influence household factors such as temperature, humidity, light irradiation, and indoor surfaces. This comprehensive review article summarized the research progress on indoor HONO pollution based on indoor air measurements, laboratory studies, and model simulations. The environmental and health effects were highlighted, measurement techniques were summarized, pollution levels, sources and sinks, and household influencing factors were discussed, and the prospects in the future were proposed. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Surging incidents of air quality-related public health hazards, and environmental degradation, have prompted the global authorities to seek newer avenues of air quality monitoring, especially in developing economies, where the situation appears most alarming besides difficulties around ‘adequate’ deployment of air quality sensors. In the present narrative, we adopt a systematic review methodology (PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) around recent global literature (2002–2022), around moss-based passive biomonitoring approaches which might offer the regulatory authorities a complementary means to fill ‘gaps’ in existing air quality records. Following the 4-phased search procedure under PRISMA, total of 123 documents were selected for review. A wealth of research demonstrates how passive biomonitoring, with strategic use of mosses, could become an invaluable regulatory (and research) tool to monitor atmospheric deposition patterns and help identifying the main drivers of air quality changes (e.g., anthropogenic and/or natural). Besides individual studies, we briefly reflect on the European Moss Survey, underway since 1990, which aptly showcases mosses as ‘naturally occurring’ sensors of ambient air quality for a slew of metals (heavy and trace) and persistent organic pollutants, and help assessing spatio-temporal changes therein. To that end, we urge the global research community to conduct targeted research around various pollutant uptake mechanisms by mosses (e.g., species-specific interactions, environmental conditions, land management practices). Of late, mosses have found various environmental applications as well, such as in epidemiological investigations, identification of pollutant sources and transport mechanisms, assessment of air quality in diverse and complex urban ecosystems, and even detecting short-term changes in ambient air quality (e.g., COVID-19 Lockdown), each being critical for the authorities to develop informed and strategic regulatory measures. To that end, we review current literature and highlight to the regulatory authorities how to extend moss-based observations, by integrating them with a wide range of ecological indicators to assess regional environmental vulnerability/risk due to degrading air quality. Overall, an underlying motive behind this narrative was to broaden the current regulatory outlook and purview, to bolster and diversify existing air quality monitoring initiatives, by coupling the moss-based outputs with the traditional, sensor-based datasets, and attain improved spatial representation. However, we also make a strong case of conducting more targeted research to fill in the ‘gaps’ in our current understanding of moss-based passive biomonitoring details, with increased case studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.},

	abstract = {Stemness pertains to the intrinsic ability of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to undergo self-renewal and differentiate into multiple lineages, while simultaneously impeding their differentiation and preserving crucial differentiating genes in a state of quiescence and equilibrium. Owing to their favorable attributes, including uncomplicated isolation protocols, ethical compliance, and ease of procurement, MSCs have become a focal point of inquiry in the domains of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. As age increases or ex vivo cultivation is prolonged, the functionality of MSCs decreases and their stemness gradually diminishes, thereby limiting their potential therapeutic applications. Despite the existence of several uncertainties surrounding the comprehension of MSC stemness, considerable advancements have been achieved in the clarification of the potential mechanisms that lead to stemness loss, as well as the associated strategies for stemness maintenance. This comprehensive review provides a systematic overview of the factors influencing the preservation of MSC stemness, the molecular mechanisms governing it, the strategies for its maintenance, and the therapeutic potential associated with stemness. Finally, we underscore the obstacles and prospective avenues in present investigations, providing innovative perspectives and opportunities for the preservation and therapeutic utilization of MSC stemness.

Many metals and toxic elements, along with poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known to induce immunomodulation and have previously been linked to increased pathogen prevalence and infectious disease severity. In this study, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) was investigated at the coast of Helgeland in northern Norway. This population is commonly infected with the parasitic nematode “gapeworm” (Syngamus trachea), with a prevalence of 40–60 % during summer months. Gapeworm induces severe respiratory disease in birds and has been previously demonstrated to decrease survival and reproductive success in wild house sparrows. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a higher exposure to pollution with PFASs, metals and other elements influences gapeworm infection in wild house sparrows. We conducted PFASs and elemental analysis on whole blood from 52 house sparrows from Helgeland, including analyses of highly toxic metals such as lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As). In addition, we studied gapeworm infection load by counting the parasite eggs in faeces from each individual. We also studied the expression of microRNA 155 (miR155) as a key regulator in the immune system. Elevated blood concentrations of Pb were found to be associated with an increased prevalence of gapeworm infection in the house sparrow. The expression of miR155 in the plasma of the house sparrow was only weakly associated with Pb. In contrast, we found relatively low PFASs concentrations in the house sparrow blood (∑ PFASs 0.00048–354 μg/L) and PFASs were not associated to miR155 nor infection rate. The current study highlights the potential threat posed by Pb as an immunotoxic pollutant in small songbirds. © 2024},

	abstract = {Owing to a wide range of advantages, such as stability, non-invasiveness, and ease of sampling, hair has been used progressively for comprehensive biomonitoring of organic pollutants for the last three decades. This has led to the development of new analytical and multi-class analysis methods for the assessment of a broad range of organic pollutants in various population groups, ranging from small-scale studies to advanced studies with a large number of participants based on different exposure settings. This meta-analysis summarizes the existing literature on the assessment of organic pollutants in hair in terms of residue levels, the correlation of hair residue levels with those of other biological matrices and socio-demographic factors, the reliability of hair versus other biomatrices for exposure assessment, the use of segmental hair analysis for chronic exposure evaluation and the effect of external contamination on hair residue levels. Significantly high concentrations of organic pollutants such as pesticides, flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were reported in human hair samples from different regions and under different exposure settings. Similarly, high concentrations of pesticides (from agricultural activities), flame retardants (E-waste dismantling activities), dioxins and furans were observed in various occupational settings. Moreover, significant correlations (p < 0.05) for hair and blood concentrations were observed in majority of studies featuring pesticides and flame retardants. While among sociodemographic factors, gender and age significantly affected the hair concentrations in females and children in general exposure settings, whereas adult workers in occupational settings. Furthermore, the assessment of the hair burden of persistent organic pollutants in domestic and wild animals showed high concentrations for pesticides such as HCHs and DDTs whereas the laboratory-based studies using animals demonstrated strong correlations between exposure dose, exposure duration, and measured organic pollutant levels, mainly for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, terbuthylazine, aldrin, dieldrin and pyrethroid metabolites. Considering the critical analysis of the results obtained from literature review, hair is regarded as a reliable matrix for organic pollutant assessment; however, some limitations, as discussed in this review, need to be overcome to reinforce the status of hair as a suitable matrix for exposure assessment. © 2024},

	abstract = {Epidemiological and experimental research has indicated an association between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure and liver disease. However, the potential hepatotoxic effects and mechanisms of low-level prenatal PFOS exposure in offspring remain ambiguous. The objective of this research was to examine the alterations in liver transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in offspring rats at postnatal day (PND) 30 following gestational and lactational exposure to PFOS (from gestational day 1 to 20 and PND 1 to 21). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into a control group (3% starch gel solution, oral gavage) and a PFOS exposure group (0.03 mg/kg body weight per day, oral gavage). Histopathological changes in liver sections were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical analysis was conducted to evaluate changes in glucose and lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were utilized to identify significant genes and metabolites associated with alterations of liver glucose and lipid metabolism through an integrated multi-omics analysis. No significant differences were found in the measured biochemical parameters. In total, 167 significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to processes such as steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and fat digestion and absorption were identified in offspring rats in the PFOS exposure group. Ninety-five altered metabolites were exhibited in the PFOS exposure group, such as heptaethylene glycol, lysoPE (0:0/18:0), lucidenic acid K, and p-Cresol sulfate. DEGs associated with steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, fat digestion and absorption were significantly upregulated in the PFOS exposure group (P < 0.05). The analysis of correlations indicated that there was a significant inverse correlation between all identified differential metabolites and the levels of fasting blood glucose, high-density lipoprotein, and triglycerides in the PFOS exposure group (P < 0.05). Our findings demystify that early-life PFOS exposure can lead to alterations in transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in the offspring's liver, which provided mechanistic insights into the potential hepatotoxicity and developmental toxicity associated with environmentally relevant levels of PFOS exposure. © 2023},

	abstract = {The widespread consumption of pharmaceutical drugs and their incomplete breakdown in organisms has led to their extensive presence in aquatic environments. The indiscriminate use of antibiotics, such as sulfonamides, has contributed to the development of drug-resistant bacteria and the persistent pollution of water bodies, posing a threat to human health and the safety of the environment. Thus, it is paramount to explore remediation technologies aimed at decomposing and complete elimination of the toxic contaminants from pharmaceutical wastewater. The review aims to explore the utilization of metal-oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) and graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) in photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides from wastewater. Recent advances in oxidation techniques such as photocatalytic degradation are being exploited in the elimination of the sulfonamides from wastewater. MONP and g-C3N4 are commonly evolved nano substances with intrinsic properties. They possessed nano-scale structure, considerable porosity semi-conducting properties, responsible for decomposing wide range of water pollutants. They are widely applied for photocatalytic degradation of organic and inorganic substances which continue to evolve due to the low-cost, efficiency, less toxicity, and more environmentally friendliness of the materials. The review focuses on the current advances in the application of these materials, their efficiencies, degradation mechanisms, and recyclability in the context of sulfonamides photocatalytic degradation. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) precursors have been used in various consumer and industrial products due to their hydrophobic and oleophobic properties. In recent years, PFAA precursors in agricultural soil-plant systems have received increasing attention as they are susceptible to biotransformation into metabolites with high biotoxicity risks to human health. In this review, we systematically assessed the occurrence of PFAA precursors in agricultural soils, taking into account their sources and biodegradation pathways. In addition, we summarized the findings of the relevant literature on the uptake and biotransformation of PFAA precursors by agricultural plants. The applications of biosolids/composts and pesticides are the main sources of PFAA precursors in agricultural soils. The physicochemical properties of PFAA precursors, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, and plant species are the key factors influencing plant root uptakes of PFAA precursors from soils. This review revealed, through toxicity assessment, the potential of PFAA precursors to generate metabolites with higher toxicity than the parent precursors. The results of this paper provide a reference for future research on PFAA precursors and their metabolites in soil-plant systems. © 2023},

Combining genome-centric metagenomic and metatranscriptomic analyses of microbial mat samples that experienced chronic hydrocarbon pollution for more than 80 years, we analyzed the transcriptomic activity of alkane and aromatic hydrocarbon degradation pathways at the population level. Consistent with the fluctuating and stratified redox conditions of the habitat, both aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation pathways were expressed by taxonomically and metabolically contrasted lineages including members of Bacteroidiales, Desulfobacteraceae, Pseudomonadales; Alcanivoraceae and Halieaceae populations with (photo)-heterotrophic, sulfur- and organohalide-based metabolisms, providing evidence for the co-occurrence and activity of aerobic and anaerobic hydrocarbon degradation pathways in shallow marine microbial mats. In addition, our results suggest that aerobic alkane degradation in long-term pollution involved bacterial families that are naturally widely distributed in marine habitats, but hydrocarbon concentration and composition were found to be a strong structuring factor of their intrafamily diversity and transcriptomic activities. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Vertical transmission of metabolic constituents from mother to child contributes to the manifestation of disease phenotypes in early life. This study probes the vertical transmission of metabolites from mothers to offspring by utilizing machine learning techniques to differentiate between true mother–child dyads and randomly paired non-dyads. Employing random forests (RF), light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), and logistic regression (Elasticnet) models, we analyzed metabolite concentration discrepancies in mother–child pairs, with maternal plasma sampled at 24 weeks of gestation and children’s plasma at 6 months. The propensity of vertical transfer was quantified, reflecting the likelihood of accurate mother–child matching. Our findings were substantiated against an external test set and further verified through statistical tests, while the models were explained using permutation importance and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The best model was achieved using RF, while xenobiotics were shown to be highly relevant in transfer. The study reaffirms the transmission of certain metabolites, such as perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), but also reveals additional insights into the maternal influence on the child’s metabolome. We also discuss the multifaceted nature of vertical transfer. These machine learning-driven insights complement conventional epidemiological findings and offer a novel perspective on using machine learning as a methodology for understanding metabolic interactions. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This review provides a comprehensive overview of the occurrence, fate, treatment and multi-criteria analysis of microplastics (MPs) and organic contaminants (OCs) in biosolids. A meta-analysis was complementarily analysed through the literature to map out the occurrence and fate of MPs and 10 different groups of OCs. The data demonstrate that MPs (54.7% occurrence rate) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants (44.2% occurrence rate) account for the highest prevalence of contaminants in biosolids. In turn, dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs) have the lowest rates (<0.01%). The occurrence of several OCs (e.g., dioxin, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceutical and personal care products, ultraviolet filters, phosphate flame retardants) in Europe appear at higher rates than in Asia and the Americas. However, MP concentrations in biosolids from Australia are reported to be 10 times higher than in America and Europe, which required more measurement data for in-depth analysis. Amongst the OC groups, brominated flame retardants exhibited exceptional sorption to biosolids with partitioning coefficients (log Kd) higher than 4. To remove these contaminants from biosolids, a wide range of technologies have been developed. Our multicriteria analysis shows that anaerobic digestion is the most mature and practical. Thermal treatment is a viable option; however, it still requires additional improvements in infrastructure, legislation, and public acceptance. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is known to cause acute severe pain episodes known as vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC) mainly treated with opioid analgesics. Since the opioid epidemic there is an interest in determining the opioid misuse potential in these patients. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine the rates of opioid misuse among patients with SCD by assessing the rate of unexpected drug screening results in a sickle cell disease clinic. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review study conducted at the outpatient sickle cell disease clinic. The primary independent variables were the prescribed opioid medications while the primary dependent variable was the collected opioid metabolite. Descriptive statistics, linear regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted using SPSS version 24. Results: A total of 100 participants were recruited from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020 with 71 included in the analysis. The total mean of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for all participants was 71.1±104.9 with 71% of participants having a daily calculated MME of <90MME. The odds of misusing an opioid were 6.72 times higher (P<.02) if a participant used marijuana compared to a participant who didn’t. In addition, the odds of misusing an opioid were 2.47 times higher (P<.04) if the patient was prescribed an opioid daily dose greater than 90 MME as opposed to a daily dose less than 90 MME. Conclusion: Participants who consumed greater than 90 MME’s per day and utilized marijuana were more likely to misuse opioids. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widely used due to their unique structure and excellent performance, while also posing threats on ecosystem, especially long-chain perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). As the control of conventional PFASs, fluoroalkylether substances (ether-PFASs) as alternatives are constantly emerging. Subsequently, the three representative ether-PFASs, chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid (F-53B), hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA), and 4,8-Dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoicacid (ADONA) are discovered and have received more attention in the environment and ecosystem. But their security is now also being challenged. This review systematically assesses their security from six dimensions including environmental occurrence in water, soil and atmosphere, as well as bioaccumulation and risk in plants, animals and humans. High substitution level is observed for F-53B, whether in environment or living things. Like PFOS or even more extreme, F-53B exhibits high biomagnification ability, transmission efficiency from maternal to infant, and various biological toxicity effects. HFPO-DA still has a relatively low substitution level for PFOA, but its use has emerged in Europe. Although it is less detected in human bodies and has a higher metabolic rate than PFOA, the strong migration ability of HFPO-DA in plants may pose dietary safety concerns for humans. Research on ADONA is limited, and currently, it is detected in Germany frequently while remaining at trace levels globally. Evidently, F-53B has shown increasing risk both in occurrence and toxicity compared to PFOS, and HFPO-DA is relatively safe based on available data. There are still knowledge gaps on security of alternatives that need to be addressed. © 2024},

	abstract = {Resilience is a multidisciplinary concept that deals with rapid response and recovery of a system experiencing a disruption. Despite extensive research on this topic, there is a need to clarify resilience concepts in the context of road freight transportation systems (FTSs) from a three-dimensional perspective (i.e., physical infrastructure, users, and managing organizations) and to identify persistent knowledge gaps concerning the characterization and measurement of FTS resilience vis-à-vis disruptive events. This paper addresses these shortcomings through a systematic review of 149 research studies. The synthesis of findings clarifies inconsistencies associated with the characteristics of FTS resilience and in so doing, establishes a unified framework for measuring FTS resilience through the life cycle of disruptive events. Critical data gaps, methodological shortcomings, and a lack of empirical evidence concerning FTS resilience to disruptive events remain. More robust analytical approaches are required to incorporate interdependencies among FTS dimensions into resilience assessments. © 2023 Patnala, Regehr, Mehran, and The Crown.},

	abstract = {The pervasive presence of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in diverse products has led to their introduction into wastewater systems, making wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) significant PFAS contributors to the environment. Despite WWTPs' efforts to mitigate PFAS impact through physicochemical and biological means, concerns persist regarding PFAS retention in generated biosolids. While numerous review studies have explored the fate of these compounds within WWTPs, no study has critically reviewed their presence, transformation mechanisms, and partitioning within the sludge. Therefore, the current study has been specifically designed to investigate these aspects. Studies show variations in PFAS concentrations across WWTPs, highlighting the importance of aqueous-to-solid partitioning, with sludge from PFOS and PFOA-rich wastewater showing higher concentrations. Research suggests biological mechanisms such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, transamine metabolism, and beta-oxidation are involved in PFAS biotransformation, though the effects of precursor changes require further study. Carbon chain length significantly affects PFAS partitioning, with longer chains leading to greater adsorption in sludge. The wastewater's organic and inorganic content is crucial for PFAS adsorption; for instance, higher sludge protein content and divalent cations like calcium and magnesium promote adsorption, while monovalent cations like sodium impede it. In conclusion, these discoveries shed light on the complex interactions among factors affecting PFAS behavior in biosolids. They underscore the necessity for thorough considerations in managing PFAS presence and its impact on environmental systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Comprehensive molecular analyses of metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) are lacking. Here, we generate multi-omic profiling of 257 primary and 176 metastatic regions from 182 HCC patients. Primary tumors rich in hypoxia signatures facilitated polyclonal dissemination. Genomic divergence between primary and metastatic HCC is high, and early dissemination is prevalent. The remarkable neoantigen intratumor heterogeneity observed in metastases is associated with decreased T cell reactivity, resulting from disruptions to neoantigen presentation. We identify somatic copy number alterations as highly selected events driving metastasis. Subclones without Wnt mutations show a stronger selective advantage for metastasis than those with Wnt mutations and are characterized by a microenvironment rich in activated fibroblasts favoring a pro-metastatic phenotype. Finally, metastases without Wnt mutations exhibit higher enrichment of immunosuppressive B cells that mediate terminal exhaustion of CD8+ T cells via HLA-E:CD94-NKG2A checkpoint axis. Collectively, our results provide a multi-dimensional dissection of the complex evolutionary process of metastasis. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Endometriosis, characterized by endometrial-like mucosal tissue outside the uterine cavity, is a reproductive disorder afflicting about 10% of women within the reproductive age. The pathogenesis of endometriosis has been attributed to factors like genetics, environmental particles, and hormones. A comprehensive review of studies from July 2010 to July 2023 across multiple databases was done to aid in a better understanding of the same. The investigation focused on studies delineating the correlation between endocrine disruptors, microRNAs, and endometriosis. To optimize the search scope, keywords and subject headings were used as search terms. Then, two authors rigorously assessed studies using criteria, selecting 27 studies from various databases. Notably, dioxins, organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls exhibited a solid connection for endometriosis, while bisphenol A and phthalates yielded conflicting results. The heightened presence of bisphenol A, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalates was linked to altered gene expression, including genes like AKR1B10, AKR1C3, and FAM49B. MicroRNAs like miRNA-31, miRNA-144, and miRNA-145 emerged as vital factors in the onset of endometriosis and progression. Furthermore, elevated expression of miR-1304-3p, miR-544, and miR-3684 and reduced expression of miR-3935 and miR-4427 exert substantial influence on signaling pathways like NF-κB, MAPK, and Wnt/β-catenin. Currently, literature shows an independent link between endocrine disruptor exposure and endometriosis and between microRNA dysregulation and endometriosis. However, research lacks the combination of all three factors.

	abstract = {Background: Perfluorocarbon (PFC)possesses unique chemical properties that favor the pigment epithelium’s adhesion and allows the drainage of subretinal fluid through retinal holes present in retinal detachment cases. However, PFC as a temporary tamponade agent has been limited due to its high potential for toxicity. Main body: We conducted a scoping review regarding the use of PFC in vitreoretinal surgery as a temporary tamponade in subjects with severe ocular trauma or severe retinal detachment who received a therapeutic intervention (vitrectomy via posterior approach with the use of PFC as a temporary tamponade), compared to vitrectomy without the use of PFC as a temporary tamponade. Outcomes of interest were retinal reattachment, visual acuity (VA), postoperative complications and retinal toxicity. The search was performed in Medline, Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Medline Daily Update, Embase databases. Reference lists from relevant review articles were also included. Two hundred thirty-eight studies were found, with no duplicate entries. In the first selection, 230 articles were eliminated; in the second selection, 6 additional articles were discarded. In total, 8 articles were obtained in this review. Two selected articles corresponded to animal studies and 6 to studies in humans. Regarding study design, 5 were case series, and 1 was a cohort study. Conclusion: PFC as a short-term tamponade had high rates of reapplication, improved VA, and the most frequent adverse effects were reversible after PFC withdrawal. Nonetheless, the quality of the studies was poor. Studies with more rigorous methodologies are needed to determine visual and structural outcomes and potential risks of PFC use as a temporary tamponade in vitreoretinal surgery. © 2024, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background Inappropriate antibiotic use contributes significantly to the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance. While government-initiated population-level interventions are fundamental in addressing this issue, their full potential remains to be explored. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing inappropriate antibiotic use among antibiotic providers and users in healthcare and community settings. Methods We will conduct a systematic literature search across multiple databases and grey literature sources. We will include studies which evaluate the effectiveness of population-level interventions to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in healthcare and community settings in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries. This includes government-initiated measures targeting antibiotic use through education, restriction, incentivization, coercion, training, persuasion, context modification, behavior modeling, or barrier reduction. Two reviewers will independently perform screening to select eligible studies, followed by data extraction. The outcomes of interest are various measures of antibiotic prescription and consumption, such as Defined Daily Dose (DDD) or number of prescriptions per year. We anticipate including a broad range of study designs and outcome measures. Therefore, we will narratively synthesize results using the categories of the population-level policy interventions of the Behavior Change Wheel Framework. We will organize outcome data by economic contexts, target populations, and implementation settings. Discussion This review will strengthen the evidence base for the use of population-level interventions to address inappropriate antibiotic use. Drawing lessons from global experiences, the findings will provide valuable guidance to health policymakers, public health authorities, and researchers on tailoring interventions to specific economic contexts, populations, and settings, thereby enhancing their capacity to drive substantial improvement in appropriate antibiotic use. © 2024 Wu et al.

We summarize studies on the association between prenatal PFAS exposure and neurodevelopment in children in order to better understand the relationship. Objective: We conducted a meta-analysis of prenatal PFAS exposure and developmental outcomes associated with intellectual, executive function and behavioral difficulty in children to explore the relationship between prenatal exposure to perfluorinated and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and neurodevelopmental disorders in children. Methods: We searched for articles published up to August 3, 2023, included and quantified original studies on PFAS and child Intelligence Quotient (IQ), executive function and behavioral difficulty during pregnancy, and systematically summarized articles that could not be quantified. Conclusion: There is evidence of sex-specific relationship between PFAS exposure and children's PIQ. We found that PFOS [β = −1.56, 95% CI = −2.96, − 0.07; exposure = per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase], PFOA [β = −1.87, 95% CI = −3.29, − 0.46; exposure = per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase], PFHxS [β = −2.02, 95% CI = −3.23, − 0.81; exposure = per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase] decreased performance IQ in boys, but PFOS [β = 1.56, 95% CI = 0.06, 3.06; exposure = per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase] increased performance IQ in girls.

	abstract = {Purpose: Surgical treatment of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS) requires a careful choice of fusion levels. The usual recommendation for the selection of the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) for double major or thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L) curves falls on L3 or L4. The aim of the present study is to assess if the spinal fusion with LIV selection of L3 or L4 in AIS patients has a clinical or radiological impact in terms of degenerative disc disease (DDD) in distal unfused segments at long-term follow-up. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases from eligible articles was conducted. Only studies regarding long-term follow-up of AIS patients treated with spinal fusion were included. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were extracted and summarized. Meta-analysis on long-term follow-up MRI studies was performed. p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Fourteen studies were included, for a total of 1264 patients. Clinical assessment of included patients showed a slight tendency to have worse clinical outcomes if spinal fusion is extended to L4 rather than L3. Despite that, meta-analysis could not be performed on clinical parameters because of heterogeneity of evaluated PROMs in included studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation at long-term follow-up showed no significant difference in terms of disc degeneration rate at overall meta-analysis (p = 0.916) between patients fused to L3 and L4. Conclusion: The LIV selection of L3 rather than L4, according to current literature, does not prevent disc degeneration in distal unfused segments over the long term. Long-term studies of patients treated with contemporary spinal instrumentation are needed. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Background: Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous chemicals in the environment and our daily lives. Several epidemiological studies have revealed that PFAS exposure is linked to male sex hormone levels; however, the conclusions are inconsistent across studies. Consequently, we performed a meta-analysis to systematically evaluate the association between PFAS exposure and male sex hormones. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standards were followed during the meta-analysis. PubMed, Wed of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases were used to identify suitable articles before June 2023. The 95% CI and β values were calculated to assess the association between male sex hormone levels and PFAS exposure. Heterogeneity among the included studies was tested using inconsistency statistics (I2). Results: The literature search identified 12 published articles that met our search criteria, involving 7506 participants. Our results revealed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposures were negatively correlated with testosterone (β = –0.05; 95% CI: –0.09, –0.02, P = 0.003) and (β = –0.04; 95% CI: –0.08, 0.00, P = 0.049), respectively. Conclusion: Exposure to PFNA and PFOA is negatively correlated with changes in male testosterone levels. This correlation suggests that we need to pay attention in the future to whether they are potential risk factors for male reproductive health. © 2024 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) constitute a heterogeneous group of synthetic compounds widely used in industrial applications. The estimation of PFAS half-life (t1/2) is essential to quantify their persistence, their toxicity and mechanism of action in humans. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to summarize the evidence on PFAS half-lives in humans from the available literature, and to investigate the limitations and uncertainties characterizing half-life estimation. Methods: The search was conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Embase databases up to July 03, 2023 and was aimed at identifying all papers that estimated PFAS half-life in human populations. We excluded studies on temporal trends or providing estimates of half-life based solely on renal clearance. As persistent and ongoing exposures can influence half-life estimation, we decided to include only studies that were conducted after the main source of exposure to PFAS had ceased. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on studies that reported perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) or perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) half-life estimation. Risk of bias was evaluated using the OHAT tool. Results: A total of 13 articles were included in the review, with 5 studies conducted in exposed general populations and 8 studies conducted in exposed workers; the estimated mean half-life ranged from 1.48 to 5.1 years for PFOA, from 3.4 to 5.7 years for total PFOS, and from 2.84 to 8.5 years for PFHxS. High heterogeneity among studies was observed; potential reasons include the variability among the investigated populations, discrepancies in considering ongoing exposures, variability in PFAS isomeric compositions, accounting for background exposure, time since exposure stopped and methods used for half-life estimation. Discussion: Despite the efforts made to better understand PFAS toxicokinetics, further studies are needed to identify important characteristics of these persistent chemicals. Biomonitoring studies should focus on persistent and unaccounted sources of exposure to PFAS and on individual characteristics potentially determining half-life, to ensure accurate estimates. © 2023},

	abstract = {The electrolytic aluminum plays an irreplaceable role in the Chinese national economy. The large amount of fluorine flue gas produced by it contributes to tremendous pressure on the environment. When the concentration of PFCs in the environment reaches a certain value, it will cause damage to the central nervous system and liver of human body. The treatment method of perfluorocarbon (PFCs) is mainly based on source or end-of-pipe control, with the former having low emissions and low energy consumption and the latter having high removal rate. However, reviews of the formation mechanism and influencing factors of PFCs has seldom been conducted. Therefore, it is very important to comprehensively understand the formation mechanism and treatment status of PFCs, finding effective and rational processing technologies in the electrolytic aluminum industry for realizing effective control. This paper provides a more systematic review of the micro-formation mechanism of PFCs, pollutant source management, and ultimate pollution and carbon reduction. Each technology research progress and influencing factors in terms of material properties and process conditions are analyzed in recent years. This review aims to provide some references for subsequent related research in PFCs treatment and purification in electrolytic aluminum flue gas. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The alarming human health effects induced by endocrine disruptors (ED) have raised the attention of public opinion and policy makers leading worldwide to regulations that are continuously improved to reduce exposure to them. However, decreasing the exposure levels is challenging because EDs are ubiquitous and exposure occurs through multiple routes. The main exposure route is considered ingestion, but, recently, the inhalation has been hypothesized as an important additional route. To explore this scenario, some authors applied bioassays to assess the endocrine activity of air. This review summarizes for the first time the applied methods and the obtained evidences about the in vitro endocrine activity of airborne particulate matter (PM) collected outdoor. Among the bioassay endpoints, (anti)oestrogenic and (anti)androgenic activities were selected because are the most studied endocrine activities. A total of 24 articles were ultimately included in this review. Despite evidences are still scarce, the results showed that PM can induce oestrogenic, antioestrogenic, androgenic and antiandrogenic effects, suggesting that PM has an endocrine disrupting potential that should be considered because it could represent a further source of exposure to EDs. Although it is difficult to estimate how much inhalation can contribute to the total burden of EDs, endocrine activity of PM may increase the human health risk. Finally, the results pointed out that the overall endocrine activity is difficult to predict from the concentrations of individual pollutants, so the assessment using bioassays could be a valuable additional tool to quantify the health risk posed by EDs in air. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Previous studies showed that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), which are widely found in the environment, can disrupt endocrine homeostasis when they enter the human body. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate current human epidemiological evidence on the relationship between PFAS exposure and glucolipid metabolism in childhood and adolescence. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases, and identified population-based epidemiological studies related to PFAS and glucolipid metabolism indexes that were published before 30 December 2022. The heterogeneity of the included literature was assessed using the I-square (I2) test and statistics Q. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to combine the effect size. Subgroup analysis based on age and sex of the study participants was performed. A sensitivity analysis was used to evaluate the robustness and reliability of the combined results. Egger’s and Begg’s tests were used to analyze publication bias. Results: A total of 12 studies were included in this analysis. There was a positive association between PFAS and TC (β = 1.110, 95% CI: 0.601, 1.610) and LDL (β = 1.900, 95% CI: 1.030, 2.770), and a negative association between PFAS and HOMA-IR in children and adolescents (β = −0.130, 95% CI: −0. 200, −0.059). PFOS was significant positive associated with TC (β = 8.22, 95% CI: 3.93, 12.51), LDL (β = (12.04, 95% CI: 5.08, 18.99), and HOMA-IR (β = −0.165, 95% CI: −0.292, −0.038). Subgroup analysis showed that exposure to PFAS in the adolescent group was positively associated with TC and LDL levels, and the relationship was stronger in females. Conclusion: PFAS exposure is associated with glucolipid metabolism in children and adolescents. Among them, PFOS may play an important role. Recognition of environmental PFAS exposure is critical for stabilizing the glycolipid metabolism relationship during the growth and development of children and adolescents.

	abstract = {Background and objective: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) have been shown to be persistent and bioaccumulative. An elevated danger of pregnancy complications perhaps connected with exposure to PFASs, but the potential effects remain elusive. The objective of this study is to investigate the possible association between PFASs exposure and pregnancy complications, drawing upon existing evidence. Methods: Electronic databases of PubMed, Qvid Medline, Embase, and Web of Science were searched thoroughly to identify eligible research published prior to November 28, 2023, examining the relationship between PFASs and pregnancy-related complications. To evaluate the quality of observational studies incorporated into the article, the Strengthening Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) tool was utilized. The main outcomes assessed in this study included gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), gestational hypertension (GH), and preeclampsia (PE). Results: Twenty-five relevant studies involving 30079 participants were finally selected from four databases. The combined estimates indicate that prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and perfluoroenanthic acid (PFHpA) is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (PFOA: OR = 1.45, 95%CI: 1.07–1.94, P = 0.015; PFHxS: OR = 1.16, 95%CI: 1.00–1.36, P = 0.055; PFBS: OR = 1.44, 95%CI: 1.16–1.79, P = 0.001; PFHpA: OR = 1.41, 95%CI: 1.10–1.82, P = 0.008). The exposure to PFBS is positively associated with HDP (OR = 1.27, 95%CI: 1.14–1.41, P < 0.001), while both PFOA and PFHpA demonstrate statistically significant positive correlations with GH (PFOA: OR = 1.09, 95%CI: 1.00–1.19, P = 0.049; PFHpA: OR = 1.43, 95%CI: 1.15–1.78, P = 0.001). Negative correlations were observed for prenatal perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoA) exposure and GH (OR = 0.71, 95%CI: 0.57–0.87, P = 0.001). However, no compelling evidence was identified to link PFASs exposure with the risk of PE. Conclusion: According to the meta-analysis findings, exposure to PFASs may be linked to GDM, HDP, and GH, but it does not significantly raise the risk of PE alone. Further research with larger sample size is required to verify this potential association and explore the biological mechanisms. © 2024 The Authors},

Data were extracted from a total of 14 primary research articles aligned with bench-scale investigations into 6:2 and/or 8:2 FTOH biotransformation; these data were subjected to a random effect NMA to simultaneously evaluate influences of various experimental conditions on biotransformation. Effectiveness rankings were used to summarize experimental conditions promoting FTOH to PFCA transformation from the greatest to least effect on conversion. Results related to atmospheric conditions and/or electron accepting processes (from greatest to least effect on PFCA formation) are as follows: aerobic, nitrate reducing conditions, microoxic, anaerobic (unamended electron acceptor [EA]), sulfate reducing conditions, and iron reducing conditions. A greater association with PFCA formation was observed under mesophilic conditions compared to psychrophilic conditions. Multiple conditions that promote FTOH to PFCA bioconversion in environmental matrices were identified in this study. Several conditions under which transformation is unlikely have also been identified, suggesting the possibility of long-term FTOH retention in impacted media with limited short- and long-chain PFCA mobilization. Our findings further suggest the need for advancing our understanding of FTOH transformation in media receiving excessive nitrogen from anthropogenic sources. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Purpose: This systematic review examined the emerging threat of indoor and outdoor pollutants to public health in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC). Design/methodology/approach: Pollutants and pollution levels are becoming an increasing cause for concern within the LAC region, primarily because of the rapid increase in urbanization and the use of fossil fuels. The rise in indoor and outdoor air pollutants impacts public health, and there are limited regional studies on the impact of these pollutants and how they affect public health. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOhost, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases. Significant search terms included “indoor air pollution,” “outdoor air pollution,” “pollution,” “Latin America,” “Central America,” “South America” and “Caribbean was used.” The systematic review utilized the Rayyan systematic software for uploading and sorting study references. Findings: Database searches produced 1,674 results, of which, after using the inclusion–exclusion criteria and assessing for bias, 16 studies were included and used for the systematic review. These studies covered both indoor and outdoor pollution. Various indoor and outdoor air pollutants linked to low birth weight, asthma, cancer and DNA impairment were reported in this review. Even though only some intervention programs are available within the region to mitigate the harmful effects of pollution, these programs need to be robust and appropriately implemented, causing possible threats to public health. Significant gaps in the research were identified, especially in the Caribbean. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study include limited available research done within LAC, with most of the research quantifying pollutants rather than addressing their impacts. Additionally, most studies focus on air pollution but neglect water and land pollution’s effects on public health. For this reason, the 16 studies included limited robustness of the review. Originality/value: Although available studies quantifying pollution threats in LAC were identified in this review, research on the adverse impacts of pollution, especially concerning public health, is limited. LAC countries should explore making cities more energy-efficient, compact and green while improving the transportation sector by utilizing clean power generation. In order to properly lessen the effects of pollution on public health, more research needs to be done and implemented programs that are working need to be strengthened and expanded. © 2023, Danladi Chiroma Husaini, Kemberly Manzur and Jorge Medrano.},

	abstract = {Food and nutrition-related factors, including foods and nutrients consumed, dietary patterns, use of dietary supplements, adiposity, and exposure to food-related environmental contaminants, have the potential to impact semen quality and male and female fertility; obstetric, fetal, and birth outcomes; and the health of future generations, but gaps in evidence remain. On 9 November 2022, Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy and the school's Food and Nutrition Innovation Institute hosted a 1-d meeting to explore the evidence and evidence gaps regarding the relationships between food, nutrition, and fertility. Topics addressed included male fertility, female fertility and gestation, and intergenerational effects. This meeting report summarizes the presentations and deliberations from the meeting. Regarding male fertility, a positive association exists with a healthy dietary pattern, with high-quality evidence for semen quality and lower quality evidence for clinical outcomes. Folic acid and zinc supplementation have been found to not impact male fertility. In females, body weight status and other nutrition-related factors are linked to nearly half of all ovulation disorders, a leading cause of female infertility. Females with obesity have worse fertility treatment, pregnancy-related, and birth outcomes. Environmental contaminants found in food, water, or its packaging, including lead, perfluorinated alkyl substances, phthalates, and phenols, adversely impact female reproductive outcomes. Epigenetic research has found that maternal and paternal dietary-related factors can impact outcomes for future generations. Priority evidence gaps identified by meeting participants relate to the effects of nutrition and dietary patterns on fertility, gaps in communication regarding fertility optimization through changes in nutritional and environmental exposures, and interventions impacting germ cell mechanisms through dietary effects. Participants developed research proposals to address the priority evidence gaps. The workshop findings serve as a foundation for future prioritization of scientific research to address evidence gaps related to food, nutrition, and fertility. © 2023},

	abstract = {The detection of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in aqueous matrices is an emerging environmental concern due to their persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic properties. Foam fractionation has emerged as a viable method for removing and concentrating PFAS from aqueous matrices. The method exploits the surface-active nature of the PFAS to adsorb at the air-liquid interfaces of rising air bubbles, resulting in foam formation at the top of a foam fractionator. The removal of PFAS is then achieved through foam harvesting. Foam fractionation has gained increasing attention owing to its inherent advantages, including simplicity and low operational costs. The coupling of foam fractionation with destructive technologies could potentially serve as a comprehensive treatment train for future PFAS management in aqueous matrices. The PFAS-enriched foam, which has a smaller volume, can be directed to subsequent destructive treatment technologies. In this review, we delve into previous experiences with foam fractionation for PFAS removal from various aqueous matrices and critically analyse their key findings. Then, the recent industry advancements and commercial projects that utilise this technology are identified. Finally, future research needs are suggested based on the current challenges. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Advances in industrial and technological innovations have led to significant socio-economic benefits, but with overwhelming negative impacts on the environment. These impacts include the infiltration of organic contaminants into soil, water, and air, posing a threat to the environment and public health. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are increasingly released as waste, endangering the environment. In countries like Ghana, where regulations are weakly enforced, industrial waste is released uncontrollably, posing threats to public health, environmental integrity, and food systems. This study systematically evaluated existing literature on PBDEs, heavy metals, PAHs, and organic contaminant exposure in Ghana and proposes a roadmap for achieving food safety and protecting the environment and human health. The research identified high mobility of specific heavy metals and risks associated with PBDEs and PAHs in sediments, dumpsites, and various food items. Unregulated dumping of electronic waste with PBDEs raised environmental concerns. An integrated approach is needed to address the multifaceted impact of organic pollutants on public health and ecosystems. Urgent implementation of effective environmental management strategies and regulatory measures is crucial. The study proposed short- to mid-term priorities emphasising the need to foster collaboration and implementing global measures. The mid- to long-term strategy includes a national information surveillance system, local monitoring capacity development, and integrating land contamination controls with food safety legislation. These measures would mitigate risks, ensure sustainable practices, and improve overall food safety management in Ghana, serving as a model for regions facing similar challenges with diverse pollutants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.},

	abstract = {Landfill leachate is a seriously polluted and hazardous liquid, which contains a high concentration of refractory organics, ammonia nitrogen, heavy metals, inorganic salts, and various suspended solids. The favorable disposal of landfill leachate has always been a hot and challenging issue in wastewater treatment. As one of the best available technologies for landfill leachate disposal, coagulation has been studied extensively. However, there is an absence of a systematic review regarding coagulation in landfill leachate treatment. In this paper, a review focusing on the characteristics, mechanisms, and application of coagulation in landfill leachate treatment was provided. Different coagulants and factors influencing the coagulation effect were synthetically summarized. The performance of coagulation coupled with other processes and their complementary advantages were elucidated. Additionally, the economic analysis conducted in this study suggests the cost-effectiveness of the coagulation process. Based on previous studies, challenges and perspectives met by landfill leachate coagulation treatment were also put forward. Overall, this review will provide a reference for the coagulation treatment of landfill leachate and promote the development of efficient and eco-friendly leachate treatment technology. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background Treatment failure is considered to be an important factor in relation to the increase in scabies incidence over the last decade. However, the regional and temporal differences, in addition to the predictors of therapy failure, are unclear. Objectives We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the prevalence of treatment failure in patients with scabies and investigation of associated factors. Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 2021 for randomized and quasi-randomized trials, in addition to observational studies that enrolled children or adults diagnosed with confirmed or clinical scabies treated with permethrin, ivermectin, crotamiton, benzyl benzoate, malathion, sulfur or lindane, and measured treatment failure or factors associated with treatment failure. We performed a random effects meta-analysis for all outcomes reported by at least two studies. Results A total of 147 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. The overall prevalence of treatment failure was 15.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9–17.6; I2=95.3%, moderate-certainty evidence] with regional differences between World Health Organization regions (P=0.003) being highest in the Western Pacific region (26.9%, 95% CI 14.5–41.2). Oral ivermectin (11.8%, 95% CI 8.4–15.4), topical ivermectin (9.3%, 95% CI 5.1–14.3) and permethrin (10.8%, 95% CI 7.5–14.5) had relatively lower failure prevalence compared with the overall prevalence. Failure prevalence was lower in patients treated with two doses of oral ivermectin (7.1%, 95% CI 3.1–12.3) compared with those treated with one dose (15.2%, 95% CI 10.8–20.2; P=0.021). Overall and permethrin treatment failure prevalence in the included studies (1983–2021) increased by 0.27% and 0.58% per year, respectively. Only three studies conducted a multivariable risk factor analysis; no studies assessed resistance. Conclusions A second dose of ivermectin showed lower failure prevalence than single-dose ivermectin, which should be considered in all guidelines. The increase in treatment failure over time hints at decreasing mite susceptibility for several drugs, but reasons for failure are rarely assessed. Ideally, scabicide susceptibility testing should be implemented in future studies. © The Author(s) 2023. Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of British Association of Dermatologists.},

	abstract = {Exposure to pesticides during pregnancy has been associated with several serious congenital malformations, such as neural tube defects, therefore, is a cause for concern in terms of human health. This review aims to gather information related to maternal exposure during pregnancy and the risk of triggering neural tube defects in the offspring. The search strategy for the studies followed the PRISMA guidelines. We conducted a systematic search in the Science Direct, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases for all epidemiological studies that sought to associate exposure to pesticides during embryonic development with the risk of neural tube defects (NTDs). The keywords used were “pesticide”, “herbicide”, “congenital” and “neural”. Of the 229 articles, 8 eligible ones (7 case-control and 1 cross-sectional) evaluated pesticide exposure in pregnancy. Different methods were used, including analysis of biological samples and questionnaires. The pesticides studied included insecticides, herbicides, fungicides, and nematicides. Insecticides were the most studied, with variations in concentrations between tissues and studies. Distinct levels of pesticides have been detected in maternal serum, placenta, and umbilical cord. Models were statistically adjusted for confounding factors, such as smoking and dietary supplement intakes. Concentrations were measured in different exposure windows (periconception and prenatal), related to NTDs such as anencephaly and spina bifida. Different data collection techniques, types of biological samples, and exposure windows were used, which made comparison difficult. The main pesticides studied included DDT, DDE, HCH, and endosulfan. Maternal serum showed the highest concentrations of pesticides, but detection in placental tissue and umbilical cord confirms embryonic exposure. Confounding variables were adjusted for in the analysis of the articles, but they may still contribute to the risk of NTDs. All the studies analyzed pesticide exposure and the relationship with NTDs. However, a more standardized survey would be ideal for better comparisons. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a common liver disease with a prevalence of up to 25%; it not only adversely affects human health but also aggravates the economic burden of society. An increasing number of studies have suggested that the occurrence of chronic noncommunicable diseases is affected by both environmental exposures and genetic factors. Research has also shown that environmental pollution may increase the risk of MAFLD and promote its occurrence and development. However, the relationship between these concepts, as well as the underlying exposure effects and mechanism, remains incompletely understood. Lipidomics, a branch of metabolomics that studies lipid disorders, can help researchers investigate abnormal lipid metabolites in various disease states. Lipidome-exposome wide association studies are a promising paradigm for investigating the health effects of cumulative environmental exposures on biological responses, and could provide new ideas for determining the associations between metabolic and lipid changes and disease risk caused by chemical-pollutant exposure. Hence, in this study, targeted exposomics and nontargeted lipidomics studies based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) were used to characterize exogenous chemical pollutants and endogenous lipid metabolites in the sera of patients with MAFLD and healthy subjects. The results demonstrated that fipronil sulfone, malathion dicarboxylic acid, and monocyclohexyl phthalate may be positively associated with the disease risk of patients diagnosed as simple fatty liver disease (hereafter referred to as MAFLD(0)). Moreover, fipronil sulfone, acesulfame potassium, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), 4-hydroxybenzophenone, and 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (DBPOB) may be positively associated with the disease risk of patients diagnosed as fatty liver complicated by single or multiple metabolic disorders. Association analysis was carried out to explore the lipid metabolites induced by chemical residues. Triglyceride (TG) and diglyceride (DG) were significantly increased in MAFLD and MAFLD(0). The numbers of carbons of significantly changed DGs and TGs were mainly in the ranges of 32-40 and 35-60, respectively, and both were mainly characterized by changes in polyunsaturated lipids. Most of the lipid-effect markers were positively correlated with chemical residues and associated with increased disease risk. Our research provides a scientific basis for studies on the association and mechanism between serum chemical-pollutant residues and disease outcomes.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are widely used in industrial production, causing potential health risks to the residents living around chemical industrial plants; however, the lack of data on population exposure and adverse effects impedes our understanding and ability to prevent risks. In this study, we performed screening and association analysis on exogenous PFAS pollutants and endogenous small-molecule metabolites in the serum of elderly residents living near industrial plants. Exposure levels of 11 legacy and novel PFASs were determined. PFOA and PFOS were major contributors, and PFNA, PFHxS, and 6:2 Cl-PFESA also showed high detection frequencies. Association analysis among PFASs and 287 metabolites identified via non-target screening was performed with adjustments of covariates and false discovery rate. Strongly associated metabolites were predominantly lipid and lipid-like molecules. Steroid hormone biosynthesis, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and fatty-acid-related pathways, including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, linoleic acid metabolism, α-linolenic acid metabolism, and fatty acid biosynthesis, were enriched as the metabolic pathways associated with mixed exposure to multiple PFASs, providing metabolic explanation and evidence for the potential mediating role of adverse health effects as a result of PFAS exposure. Our study achieved a comprehensive screening of PFAS exposure and associated metabolic profiling, demonstrating the promising application for integrated analysis of exposome and metabolome. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Present study focused on per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) occurrence in dry and wet seasons in the middle and lower Yangtze River (YZR) and changing temporal trends after years of control. Results revealed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) was 75 % of total PFAS concentrations (∑11PFASs). ∑11PFASs were ranged 0.20–28.49 ng/L and 1.17–112.84 μg/kg in water and sediment. The logKoc of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids was positive with the carbon chain length (p < 0.05, r2 = 0.78). A meta-analysis of results from 16 peer-reviewed publications about PFASs in the YZR showed that fluorochemical industries strongly influenced the high PFAS levels in the detected scenes. PFOA was still the primary pollutant. Individual PFAS in the lower reach was higher than those in the middle reach. The mass loading of PFASs imported into the sea was 10.80 t/y. This study will help develop effective approaches for controlling emerging pollutants in the YZR. © 2023},

	abstract = {Omega-6 fatty acids are the primary polyunsaturated fatty acids in most Western diets, while their role in diabetes remains controversial. Exposure of omega-6 fatty acids to an oxidative environment results in the generation of a highly reactive carbonyl species known as trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). The timely and efficient detoxification of this metabolite, which has actions comparable to other reactive carbonyl species, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and methylglyoxal, is essential for disease prevention. However, the detoxification mechanism for tt-DDE remains elusive. In this study, the enzyme Aldh9a1b is identified as having a key role in the detoxification of tt-DDE. Loss of Aldh9a1b increased tt-DDE levels and resulted in an abnormal retinal vasculature and glucose intolerance in aldh9a1b−/− zebrafish. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that tt-DDE and aldh9a1b deficiency in larval and adult zebrafish induced insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis. Moreover, alterations in hyaloid vasculature is induced by aldh9a1b knockout or by tt-DDE treatment can be rescued by the insulin receptor sensitizers metformin and rosiglitazone. Collectively, these results demonstrated that tt-DDE is the substrate of Aldh9a1b which causes microvascular damage and impaired glucose metabolism through insulin resistance. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Chlorophenols are persistent environmental pollutants used in synthesizing dyes, drugs, pesticides, and other industrial products. The chlorophenols released from these processes seriously threaten the environment and human health. The present study describes 4-chlorophenol (4-CP) degradation activity and metagenome structure of a bacterial consortium enriched in a 4-CP-containing medium. The consortium utilized 4-CP as a single carbon source at a wide pH range, temperature, and in the presence of heavy metals. The immobilized consortium retained its degradation capacity for an extended period. The 4-aminoantipyrine colorimetric analysis revealed complete mineralization of 4-CP up to 200 mg/L concentration and followed the zero-order kinetics. The addition of glycerol and yeast extract enhanced the degradation efficiency. The consortium showed both ortho- and meta-cleavage activity of catechol dioxygenase. Whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis revealed the microbial compositions and functional genes related to xenobiotic degradation pathways. The identified genes were mapped on the KEGG database to construct the 4-CP degradation pathway. The results exhibited the high potential of the consortium for bioremediation of 4-CP contaminated sites. To our knowledge, this is the first report on WGS analysis of a 4-CP degrading bacterial consortium. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The daunting effects of persistent organic pollutants on humans, animals, and the environment cannot be overemphasized. Their fate, persistence, long-range transport, and bioavailability have made them an environmental stressor of concern which has attracted the interest of the research community. Concerted efforts have been made by relevant organizations utilizing legislative laws to ban their production and get rid of them completely for the sake of public health. However, they have remained refractive in different compartments of the environment. Their bioavailability is majorly a function of different anthropogenic activities. Landfilling and incineration are among the earliest classical means of environmental remediation of waste; however, they are not sustainable due to the seepage of contaminants in landfills, the release of toxic gases into the atmosphere and energy requirements during incineration. Other advanced waste destruction technologies have been explored for the degradation of these recalcitrant pollutants; although, some are efficient, but are limited by high amounts of energy consumption, the use of organic solvents and hazardous chemicals, high capital and operational cost, and lack of public trust. Thus, this study has systematically reviewed different contaminant degradation technologies, their efficiency, and feasibility. Finally, based on techno-economic feasibility, non-invasiveness, efficiency, and environmental friendliness; radiation technology can be considered a viable alternative for the environmental remediation of contaminants in all environmental matrices at bench-, pilot-, and industrial-scale. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.},

This prevalence poses potential risks to human health, ecosystems, and the safety of drinking water. However, there is currently a lack of comprehensive reviews that systematically categorize the distribution characteristics and transformation mechanisms of PFASs in drinking water sources. This review aims to address this gap by concentrating on the specific sources of PFASs contamination in Chinese drinking water supplies. It seeks to elucidate the migration and transformation processes of PFASs within each source, summarize the distribution patterns of PFASs in surface and subsurface drinking water sources, and analyze how PFASs molecular structure, solubility, and sediment physicochemical parameters influence their presence in both the water phase and sediment. Furthermore, this review assesses two natural pathways for PFASs degradation, namely photolysis and biodegradation. It places particular emphasis on understanding the degradation mechanisms and the factors that affect the breakdown of PFASs by microorganisms. The ultimate goal is to provide valuable insights for the prevention and control of PFAS contamination and the assurance of drinking water quality. © 2023},

Micro/nanoplastics can adhere to terrestrial plant surfaces, be absorbed and transported by plants, and accumulate in the edible parts of plants, leading to the possibility of enrichment and transmission through the food chain and threatening human health. However, the underlying mechanism remains unclear. With increased studies on the internalization of micro/nanoplastics in terrestrial plants, a comprehensive and systematic review summarizing the current research trends and progress is warranted to provide a reference for further relevant research. Based on bibliometric analysis, this study focused on the mechanisms, study methods, and reduction techniques of micro/nanoplastics adherence, uptake, and translocation by terrestrial plants. The results showed that micro/nanoplastics can adhere to the surfaces of plant tissues such as seeds, roots, and leaves. Root uptake (root-to-leaf translocation) and foliar uptake (leaf-to-root translocation) are the two simultaneous internalization pathways of MNPs in plants. The observation methods included scanning electron microscopy (SEM), confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM), pyrolysis-gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS), and inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS). We highlighted the necessity and urgency of reducing the uptake and translocation of MNPs by plants and found that the application of silicon may be a promising approach for reducing internalization.

	abstract = {Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are deemed major conveyors and point sources of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to the environment. This statistical meta-analysis of existing literature from the past 15 years focused on the significance of treatment type for PFAS removal efficiencies and the influence of PFAS sources (domestic vs. industrial) on their removal. Different sampling events, WWTPs across the world, different treatment technologies, configurations, and processes, as well as different PFAS classes and compounds were considered. This study evaluated 13 PFAS analyzed predominantly in 161 WWTPs across the world. The statistical test results revealed that these 13 frequently detected and reported PFAS can be divided into four groups based on their behavior during wastewater treatment, namely (1) C6–10 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), (2) C4,5,11,12 PFCAs, (3) C4,6,8 perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and (4) C10 PFSA. In this study, biological treatments such as (1) membrane bioreactors, (2) combination of two or more biological treatments, and (3) biofilm processes revealed the highest PFAS removals, although the addition of a tertiary treatment actually had a nonbeneficial effect on PFAS removal. Moreover, a strong statistical correlation was observed between industrial wastewater sources and the presence of high influent PFAS concentrations in the receiving WWTPs. This indicates that industrial sources were the main contributors of the PFAS load in the analyzed WWTPs. Integr Environ Assess Manag 2024;20:59–69. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Residues of pesticides on crops can result in mortality to foraging bees. Pesticide applicators in the U.S. encounter a statement on pesticide labels, which coarsely indicate which products dissipate over the course of an evening. There is reason to suspect that these statements may not align with residual toxicity data, given previous findings. Without a complete database of residual toxicity estimates; however, it is not possible to determine whether the residual toxicity components of statements on pesticide labels similarly diverge from published studies. We compiled 50 studies on residual toxicity trials with formulated pesticides and calculated the residual time to 25% mortality (RT25) of each assay for three different bee species (Apis mellifera, Nomia melanderi, and Megachile rotundata). Our findings were compared to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published database of RT25 values. Of the RT25 values that we could compare, we found that over 90% of the values support a similar conclusion to the EPA. Next, we compared our values and the EPA’s values to the statements on 155 EPA registered pesticide product labels. Of these labels, a little less than a third presented their residual toxicity in a manner inconsistent with their calculated RT25 and current EPA labeling guidelines. Moreover, over a third of labels contained an active ingredient which was neither listed under the EPA’s RT25 database nor had a published study to estimate this value. We provide the first evidence that many pesticide labels may convey residual toxicity information to applicators that is not correct and could lead to bees being exposed to toxic residues on plants.

	abstract = {Background: Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) are among the fastest-growing diseases worldwide. Recent evidence has emphasized the critical role of microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA networks in various chronic wounds, including DFU. In this study, we aimed to clarify the miRNA-mRNA axes associated with the occurrence of DFU. Methods: Expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, and miRNA-mRNA regulatory axes were constructed through integrated bioinformatics analyses. We validated the miRNA-mRNA axes using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and dual-luciferase reporter assays. We conducted an immune infiltration analysis and confirmed the bioinformatics results using immunofluorescence staining. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to analyze the metabolic mechanisms. Results: miR-182-5p-CHL1/MITF and miR-338-3p-NOVA1 interactions were identified using in silico analysis. The qPCR results showed apparent dysregulation of these miRNA-mRNA axes in DFU. The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-182-5p targeted CHL1 and MITF, and miR-338-3p targeted NOVA1. We conducted an immune infiltration analysis and observed that key genes correlated with decreased infiltration of M1 macrophages and resting mast cells in DFU. Immunofluorescence staining verified the co-localization of CHL1 and tryptase, while MITF and CD68 showed weak positive correlations. Metabolic pathways related to these three genes were identified using ssGSEA. Conclusions: In summary, the miR-182-5p-CHL1/MITF and miR-338-3p-NOVA1 pathway interactions and decreased infiltration of M1 macrophages and resting mast cells may provide novel clues to the pathogenesis of DFU. Trial registration: The clinical trial included in this study was registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200066660 ) on December 13, 2022. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) as an emerging pollutant can affect aquatic organisms through physical ingestion, chemical problems and possible creation of biological layers on their surfaces in the environment. One of the significant ways for MPs to enter the aquatic environment is through the effluent discharge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, first, the concentration and characteristics of MPs in secondary wastewater effluent, and the influential variables related to the coagulation process, for MPs removal were identified using systematic reviews of previous studies. Then, the most proper MPs characterization and coagulation variables were chosen by experts’ opinions using a fuzzy Delphi method. Therefore, the experiment tested in conditions close to the full-scale wastewater treatments. Finally, in the laboratory removal of MPs by coagulation of polyamide (PA), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene (PE), < 125 and 300–600 μm in size, was tested by a jar test applying Al2(SO4)3 in doses of 5 to 100 mg/L plus 15 mg/L polyacrylamide as a coagulant aid. Using R and Excel software, the results were analyzed statistically. It was concluded that the maximum and minimum removal efficiency was 74.7 and 1.39% for small PA and large PE, respectively. Smaller MPs were found to have higher removal efficiency. The MPs type PA achieved greater removal efficiency than PS, while PE had the least removal efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Accumulating number of epidemiological studies has recently proposed that improvement in the risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) is associated with persistent organic pollutants (POPs) exposure. However, evidence from current researches is limited and inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the potential associations comprehensively. We systematically and extensively searched two electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) from inception to July 3, 2022 and an updated search was performed before submission. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from stratified random-effects meta-analyses by type of exposure and outcome. We also tested the potential heterogeneity across studies, conducted sensitivity analysis and evaluated publication bias. A total of 20 studies were finally included in our study. Meta-analytical effect estimates indicated a positive association between prenatal exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153 and PCB-170 and an increased risk of ASD, with OR of 1.89 (95% CI = 1.21–2.95, I2 = 0%), 1.61 (95% CI = 1.05–2.47, I2 = 0%) and 1.46 (95% CI = 1.03–2.06, I2 = 0%) respectively. In contrast, PFDA was found inversely associated with the risk of ASD (OR = 0.70, 95% CI = 0.52–0.94, I2 = 0%). The level of evidence supporting a link between ASD risk and exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153, PCB-170, and PFDA was respectively categorized as low, low, moderate, and low. In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-170 correlates with a heightened risk of ASD, with evidence levels rated as “low”, “low”, and “moderate”, respectively. In contrast, PFDA exposure appears to be inversely associated with ASD risk, with a “low” level of supporting evidence. However, due to the limited number of studies available for each exposure and outcome pairing, these results should be interpreted with caution. Sufficiently powered studies are needed to validate our findings. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Takotsubo cardiomyopathy is a stress-induced cardiovascular disease with symptoms comparable to those of an acute coronary syndrome but without coronary obstruction. Takotsubo was initially considered spontaneously reversible, but epidemiological studies revealed significant long-term morbidity and mortality, the reason for which is unknown. Here, we show in a female rodent model that a single pharmacological challenge creates a stress-induced cardiomyopathy similar to Takotsubo. The acute response involves changes in blood and tissue biomarkers and in cardiac in vivo imaging acquired with ultrasound, magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography. Longitudinal follow up using in vivo imaging, histochemistry, protein and proteomics analyses evidences a continued metabolic reprogramming of the heart towards metabolic malfunction, eventually leading to irreversible damage in cardiac function and structure. The results combat the supposed reversibility of Takotsubo, point to dysregulation of glucose metabolic pathways as a main cause of long-term cardiac disease and support early therapeutic management of Takotsubo. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective To systematically review the safety and feasibility of perioperative application of enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) for children with congenital choledochal cyst. Methods The literatures about the application of ERAS in pediatric congenital choledochal cyst were searched in Chinese and English databases including Wanfang Medical Network, CNKI, PubMed, Web of Science and EBSCO. Only Chinese and English literatures were searched from January 1, 2000 to August 31, 2021. English and Chinese keywords included enhanced recovery after surgery, fast track surgery, ERAS, FTS, choledochal cysts, choledochocyst, bile duct cyst, biliary dilatation and surgery. Two researchers were selected to complete data entry, including case load, perioperative interventional measures, initial postoperative exhaust and defecation time, postoperative length of stay and complications. Meta-analysis was performed with Stata 13.0 software. And 12 test was utilized for examining the heterogeneity between the eligible studies. And fixed/random-effect model was employed according to the test results. Publication bias was assessed by Begg's test. Sensitivity analysis was performed for initial postoperative defecation time and postoperative hospitalization stay. Results Seven articles with a total of 478 cases were retrieved. As compared with conventional group, ERAS group had significantly shorter initial postoperative defecation (SMD: 1. 19, 95 % CI:0. 86-1. 52, P< 0.001) and postoperative length of hospitalization stay (SMD: 1. 97, 95%CI: 1. 55-2. 38, P<0.001). ERAS group had a lower incidence of postoperative incision infection (OR: 0. 32, 95%CI:0. 10-0. 98, P<0.05), postoperative anastomotic leakage (OR: 0. 16, 95% CI: 0.03-0. 91, P<0.05) and postoperative respiratory tract infection (OR: O. 19, 95%CJ:0.06-0. 60, P<0.05). Conclusions For children with choledochal cyst, application of ERAS concept in perioperative period is both safe and feasible. It may accelerate the recovery of postoperative intestinal function, shorten postoperative length of stay and lower the occurrence of postoperative complications. © 2023 Chinese Medical Journals Publishing House Co.Ltd.

	abstract = {This manuscript presents a systematic review of PCB half-lives reported in the scientific literature. The review was completed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and included a review of almost 1000 peer-reviewed publications. In total, 26 articles were found to report half-lives in humans, with the majority of data coming from studies performed in North America on individuals suspected to have been exposed to PCBs. Terminology for reporting PCB half-lives was inconsistent, so we have attempted to consolidate this and recommend using either “apparent half-life” or “intrinsic half-life” in future studies. Within the literature, values for reported half-lives varied considerably for different PCBs. Less chlorinated PCBs generally have shorter half-lives than more chlorinated PCBs. It was interesting to note the large variability of half-lives reported for the same PCB. For example, the reported half-life for PCB 180 varied by nearly 3 orders of magnitude (0.34 years–300 years). Our review identified that the half-lives estimated were largely dependent on the studied cohort. We discuss the importance of PCB body burden, degree of chlorination and PCB structure, gender, age, breastfeeding, BMI, and smoking status on half-life estimations. We also identified significantly shorter half-lives for some PCBs in occupationally exposed individuals compared to results reported from the general population. PCB half-lives are not the same for every PCB or every individual. Therefore, careful consideration is needed when these values are used in human exposure studies. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Chronic exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is suspected to contribute to the onset of breast cancer, but the impact on the evolution of patients after diagnosis is unclear. We aimed to analyze the contribution of long-term exposure to five POPs to overall mortality, cancer recurrence, metastasis, and development of second primary tumors over a global follow-up of 10 years after surgery in breast cancer patients in a cohort study. Between 2012 and 2014, a total of 112 newly diagnosed breast cancer patients were recruited from a public hospital in Granada, Southern Spain. Historical exposure to POPs was estimated by analyzing their concentrations in breast adipose tissue samples. Sociodemographic data were collected through face-to-face interviews, while data on evolution tumor were retrieved from clinical records. Statistical analyses were performed using Cox regression (overall survival, breast cancer recurrence or metastasis) and binary logistic regression models (joint outcome variable). We also tested for statistical interactions of POPs with age, residence, and prognostic markers. The third vs first tertile of hexachlorobenzene concentrations was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (Hazard Ratio, HR = 0.26; 95 % Confidence Interval, CI = 0.07–0.92) and of the appearance of any of the four events (Odds Ratio = 0.37; 95 % CI = 0.14–1.03). Polychlorinated biphenyl 138 concentrations were significantly and inversely associated with risk of metastasis (HR = 0.65; 95 % CI = 0.44–0.97) and tumor recurrence (HR = 0.69; 95 % CI = 0.49–0.98). Additionally, p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene showed inverse associations with risk of metastasis in women with ER-positive tumors (HR = 0.49; 95 % CI = 0.25–0.93) and in those with a tumor size <2.0 cm (HR = 0.39; 95 % CI = 0.18–0.87). The observed paradoxical inverse associations of POP exposure with breast cancer evolution might be related to either a better prognosis of hormone-dependent tumors, which have an approachable pharmacological target, or an effect of sequestration of circulating POPs by adipose tissue. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {In recent years, the phenomenon of abnormal pubertal timing in children has become increasingly common worldwide. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) may be one of the risk factors contributing to this phenomenon, but the relationship between them is unclear based on current evidence. The purpose of this study was to determine the association of POPs exposure with pubertal timing in girls and boys by conducting a systematic review and meta-analysis. We searched PubMed and Embase databases for studies before June 1, 2023. Meta-analysis was performed by pooling relative risk (RR) or odds ratio (OR) or prevalence ratio (PR) or hazard ratio (HR) estimates with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis, publication bias assessment and sensitivity analysis were also carried out. A total of 21 studies were included, involving 2479 boys and 8718 girls. The results of meta-analysis showed that exposure to POPs was significantly associated with delayed pubertal timing in girls (RR: 0.85; 95 % CI: 0.79–0.91; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant association between exposure to POPs and pubertal timing in boys (RR: 1.18; 95 % CI: 0.99–1.40; p = 0.070). Subgroup analysis showed that there may be gender differences in the effects of exposure to POPs on pubertal timing. Our results suggested that exposure to POPs could delay pubertal timing in girls. However, based on current evidence, no significant association was found between POPs exposure and pubertal timing in boys. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {The development and outcome of inflammatory diseases are associated with genetic and lifestyle factors, which include chemical and nonchemical stressors. Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are major groups of chemical stressors. For example, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are closely associated with the incidence of inflammatory diseases. The pathology of environmental chemical-mediated inflammatory diseases is complex and may involve disturbances in multiple organs, including the gut, liver, brain, vascular tissues, and immune systems. Recent studies suggested that diet-derived nutrients (e.g., phytochemicals, vitamins, unsaturated fatty acids, dietary fibers) could modulate environmental insults and affect disease development, progression, and outcome. In this article, mechanisms of environmental pollutant-induced inflammation and cardiometabolic diseases are reviewed, focusing on multi-organ interplays and highlighting recent advances in nutritional strategies to improve the outcome of cardiometabolic diseases associated with environmental exposures. In addition, advanced system biology approaches are discussed, which present unique opportunities to unveil the complex interactions among multiple organs and to fuel the development of precision intervention strategies in exposed individuals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Vegetable production in Bangladesh has increased tremendously (37.63%) compared to the last decades, along with its pesticide use. The most observed pesticide groups used in vegetable production were organophosphorus, pyrethroids, carbamate, organochlorine, nereistoxin analogue group, and neonicotinoids. More specifically, chlorpyrifos, dimethoate, diazinon, and malathion were the most used pesticides. More than 29% of the vegetable samples (1577) were contaminated with pesticide residue; among the contaminated samples (458), most cases (73%) exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs). The pesticide-contaminated vegetables were cucumber (51%), tomato (41%), cauliflower (31%), miscellaneous vegetables (36%), eggplant (29%), beans (23%), cabbage (18%), and gourds (16%). Among the pesticide-contaminated samples, vegetables with above MRL were gourds (100%), beans (92), tomato (78%), eggplant (73%), miscellaneous vegetables (69%), cucumber (62%), cabbage (50%), cauliflower (50%) (p < 0.05). It was also observed that a single vegetable was often contaminated with multiple pesticides, and farmers did not follow a proper withdrawal period while using pesticides. Hazard quotation (HQ>1) was observed in adolescents and adults in tomato, eggplant, beans, cauliflower, cabbage, cucumber, lady's finger, lettuce, and coriander. There was no health risk observed (HQ<1) in gourds, potato, carrot, onion, red chilli, red amaranth, spinach, and okra. The highest acute and chronic HQ (aHQ, cHQ) was observed for cypermethrin (bean) in adolescents (aHQ=255, cHQ= 510) and adults (aHQ=131, cHQ=263). It was also observed that these pesticides harmed air, soil, water, and non-target organisms. Nevertheless, the review will help the government develop policies that reduce pesticide use and raise people's awareness of its harmful effects. © 2023 The Authors},

Although high PFAS levels have been associated with an adverse cardiovascular risk profile, the distribution of levels and relations with cardio-metabolic risk markers in the general population have not been fully characterized. We assessed the association between blood levels of perfluorooctaneic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and a range of lipoproteins and metabolites as well as clinical lipid measurements. We used data from participants of the Netherlands Epidemiology of Obesity study (NEO) (n = 584) and the Rhineland Study (n = 1962), jointly spanning an age range of 30 to 89 years. PFAS were measured with the Metabolon HD4 platform, and lipoprotein and metabolite profiles were measured using Nightingale’s nuclear magnetic resonance-spectroscopy platform, and mainly comprised lipoprotein markers. Using linear regression analyses, we quantified age-, sex-, and education-adjusted associations of PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS with clinical lipid measurements and 224 lipoproteins and metabolites. Higher levels of PFAS, particularly PFOS and PFHxS, were associated with higher concentrations of total lipid, cholesterol and phospholipid content in most HDL, IDL, LDL, and VLDL subclasses. The effect sizes were age-dependent for the majority of the associations, with the deleterious effects of PFAS being generally stronger in people below compared to those above median age. Our observation that in the general population even low PFAS concentrations are associated with an unfavorable lipid profile, calls for further critical regulation of PFAS substances. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {In Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC), agriculture is the primary consumer of water and the biggest user of pesticides worldwide. Given that groundwater is a crucial resource in this region, a systematic review was conducted to evaluate the current state of knowledge on the presence of pesticides in aquifers. The review examined 48 research papers published between 1998 and 2020, and found that only six countries in the region have information on pesticides in groundwater. A total of 70 agrochemicals were detected, encompassing legacy pesticides, herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and metabolites. Herbicides, including the widely used atrazine and glyphosate, were the most commonly detected current-use pesticides. These herbicides are being gradually banned or restricted due to their potentially harmful effects on the environment. Factors that contribute to the presence of these contaminants in aquifers include preferential flows, seasonal variations in rainfall, aquifer type, unsaturated zone thickness, and land use and management practices. Researchers noted that analysis of these contaminants is often beyond the economic or methodological scope, and analytical capacity in the region is generally limited. Based on the findings of this review, there is a clear need for groundwater pesticide monitoring in the region to reduce health risks to humans and ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Some pesticides may increase the risk of certain lymphoid malignancies, but few studies have examined Hodgkin lymphoma (HL). In this exploratory study, we examined associations between agricultural use of 22 individual active ingredients and 13 chemical groups and HL incidence. Methods: We used data from three agricultural cohorts participating in the AGRICOH consortium: the French Agriculture and Cancer Cohort (2005–2009), Cancer in the Norwegian Agricultural Population (1993–2011), and the US Agricultural Health Study (1993–2011). Lifetime pesticide use was estimated from crop-exposure matrices or self-report. Cohort-specific covariate-adjusted overall and age-specific (< 40 or ≥ 40 years) hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression and combined using random effects meta-analysis. Results: Among 316 270 farmers (75% male) accumulating 3 574 815 person-years at risk, 91 incident cases of HL occurred. We did not observe statistically significant associations for any of the active ingredients or chemical groups studied. The highest risks of HL overall were observed for the pyrethroids deltamethrin (meta-HR = 1.86, 95% CI 0.76–4.52) and esfenvalerate (1.86, 0.78–4.43), and inverse associations of similar magnitude were observed for parathion and glyphosate. Risk of HL at ≥ 40 years of age was highest for ever-use of dicamba (2.04, 0.93–4.50) and lowest for glyphosate (0.46, 0.20–1.07). Conclusion: We report the largest prospective investigation of these associations. Nonetheless, low statistical power, a mixture of histological subtypes and a lack of information on tumour EBV status complicate the interpretability of the results. Most HL cases occurred at older ages, thus we could not explore associations with adolescent or young adult HL. Furthermore, estimates may be attenuated due to non-differential exposure misclassification. Future work should aim to extend follow-up and refine both exposure and outcome classification. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exhibit high persistence in the environment and accumulate within the human body, warranting a thorough assessment of their toxicity. In this study, we exposed mice (male C57BL/6J mice aged 8 weeks) to a composite of nine PFAS, encompassing both long-chain PFAS (e.g., perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid) and short-chain PFAS (e.g., perfluorobutanoic acid and perfluorobutanesulfonic acid). The exposure concentrations of PFAS were equivalent to the estimated daily human intake in the composition reported (1 µg/L (sum of the nine compounds), representing the maximum reported exposure concentration). Histological examination revealed hepatocyte vacuolization and irregular hepatocyte cord arrangement, indicating that exposure to low levels of the PFAS mixture causes morphological changes in liver tissues. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PFAS exposure mainly altered a group of genes related to metabolism and chemical carcinogenesis. Machine learning analysis of the liver metabolome showed a typical concentration-independent alteration upon PFAS exposure, with the annotation of substances such as glutathione and 5-aminovaleric acid. This study demonstrates that daily exposure to PFAS leads to morphological changes in liver tissues and alters the expression of metabolism- and cancer-related genes as well as phospholipid metabolism. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE) as the most widely used novel brominated flame retardants (NBFRs), has become a ubiquitous emerging pollutant in the environment. However, its toxic effects on vegetable growth during agricultural production have not been reported. In this study, we investigated the response mechanisms of hydroponic lettuce to DBDPE accumulation, antioxidant stress, cell structure damage, and metabolic pathways after exposure to DBDPE. The concentration of DBDPE in the root of lettuce was significantly higher than that in the aboveground part. DBDPE induced oxidative stress on lettuce, which stimulated the defense of the antioxidative system of lettuce cells, and the cell structure produced slight plasma-wall separation. In terms of metabolism, metabolic pathway disorders were caused, which are mainly manifested as inhibiting amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism-related pathways, interfering with the biosyntheses of amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, and other substances, and ultimately manifested as decreased total chlorophyll content and root activity. In turn, metabolic regulation alleviated antioxidant stress. The mechanisms of the antioxidative reaction of lettuce to DBDPE were elucidated by IBR, PLS-PM analysis, and molecular docking. Our results provide a theoretical basis and research necessity for the evaluation of emerging pollutants in agricultural production and the safety of vegetables. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Pacific salmon transfer large quantities of material to tributaries during their spawning migrations, including carcass tissue and labile nutrients but also persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals. We conducted a Before-After-Control-Intervention experiment by adding salmon carcasses and eggs to a Michigan (USA) stream that had never received inputs from non-native salmon to understand the bioaccumulation and persistence of biotransported contaminants. Our experimental outcomes were compared to previous studies using meta-analysis. Coincident with the introduction of salmon, the PCB and DDE burden of resident trout significantly increased. However, we did not observe changes in total mercury (Hg). Two years after the salmon addition experiment concluded, resident trout POP concentrations had returned to pre-addition levels, with no difference between the treatment and control reaches. Analysis of effect sizes suggested that the contaminant response observed in our experiment is consistent with field survey observations. Our study suggested that the consumption of salmon eggs drove the increase in POP burden of resident trout while Hg bioaccumulation was influenced by watershed sources. Critically, our study suggests that ecosystems are capable of quickly recovering from POP inputs from species migrations if contaminant sources are removed. © 2023},

	abstract = {Coral reefs are considered one of the most emblematic ecosystems in our oceans, but their existence is increasingly threatened by climate change. In this study, natural populations of two reef-building coral genera, Pocillopora spp. and Porites spp., and one hydrocoral Millepora cf. platyphylla from two different marine provinces in the Pacific Ocean were investigated using a multi-omics approach as part of the Tara Pacific expedition. Here, we propose a standardised method consisting of a biphasic extraction method followed by metabolomics analysis using mass spectrometry for the lipidome and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance for hydrophilic metabolites. Our study assessed a broad range of the metabolome and is the first to identify and add 24 compounds by NMR and over 200 lipids by MS analyses for corals. Metabolic profiles were distinct among genera but not within genotypes of the cnidarian corals. Although endosymbiotic dinoflagellates of the family Symbiodiniaceae are known to play a central role in the metabolomic signature of the coral holobiont, they did not account for all differences. This suggests that a combined effect by different members of the coral holobiont and an interaction with the environment might be at play. Our study provides foundational knowledge on the coral holobiont metabolome. © 2023, Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are among the most frequently detected chemicals among the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances in aquatic environments. Because of their high detection frequency, persistence, and potential toxicity, interest in both PFOA and PFOS has increased in recent years. However, a substantial number of PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests only report nominal, or unmeasured, treatment concentrations, which may complicate the determination of protective values. In addition, previous literature has indicated that differences between nominal and measured concentrations of both PFOA and PFOS could be linked to experimental conditions (e.g., feeding regimes for test organisms, test vessel material [glass or plastic], use of solvent, and the presence of substrate). Therefore, this critical review examined whether nominal and measured concentrations were in close agreement with each other among the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature and if experimental conditions were associated with any observed differences. Nominal and measured concentrations in the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature generally displayed a high degree of linear correlation and relatively low median percent differences. Correlations between measured and nominal concentrations were >0.98 for PFOA and >0.95 for PFOS in freshwater tests across experimental conditions. For saltwater tests, correlations of >0.84 were observed for PFOA and PFOS (separate and combined) across experimental conditions. While measured PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests are generally preferred, the present meta-analysis demonstrated that experimental conditions had little influence on observed discrepancies between nominal and measured concentrations, with the exception of PFOS saltwater tests and PFOA and PFOS freshwater studies that contained substrate. Unmeasured tests with these conditions should be considered carefully based on project needs, with the caveat that the data sets for these two experimental conditions were limited.

	abstract = {Background: Many compounds are known as estrogen contaminants. Estrogenic components may enter the body through food consumption. Objectives: This systematic review aimed to determine various estrogens contaminants, the foods that are primarily contaminated with these compounds, and their common detection methods. Methods: The relevant studies with the keywords “estrogen,” “detection,” and “food” were systematically searched in PubMed and Scopus databases. Science Direct and Google Scholar were also searched. Results: A total of 221 studies were initially found regardless of publication time. The preliminary screening was based on the exclusion and inclusion criteria. Then, the qualitative evaluation of the articles was done, and finally, 9 articles were selected. Among different foods, most estrogenic compounds were identified in seafood. This finding indicates that estrogenic compounds have entered the waters. The most reported compound was bisphenol A. Cell culture was used for bioassay evaluation, and liquid chromatography methods were used for analysis. Conclusion: Both analytical and bioassay methods were used to evaluate estrogenic compounds. Most studies found that the bioassay method was also valid. © 2024 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) industry is expanding rapidly in the context of addressing the challenge of climate change and energy crisis. As a technology-intensive product, large number of new synthetic chemicals are applied in LIBs production. Organic fluorine additives are added in multiple components of LIBs, many of these additives are novel per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (with fully fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon atom), here, in this work we referred to this kind of compounds as LIB-PFAS. LIB-PFAS may cause high exposure to personnel in contact with LIBs materials during production and disposal processes, thus posing potential health risks to these occupational workers. The general population can be exposed to LIB-PFAS when they are released into the surrounding air, soil, and water. In order to assess potential health risks associated with LIB-PFAS, this review systematically summarizes the chemical structures, analytical methods, possible emission routes and human exposure pathways, their bioaccumulation, distribution, and elimination behaviors in humans, and existing toxicity data of LIB-PFAS. In particular, the screening and identification methods for 57 LIB-PFAS are discussed, as well as the investigation of emission processes and exposure risks during the manufacturing and disposal of LIB. Although the available scientific data is still limited, this review provide an insightful view and novel perspective for further research on the occupational and environmental health impacts of LIB-PFAS. © 2024 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {As a public health problem, premature ovarian insufficiency leads to infertility or sub-fertility. In addition to premature ovarian insufficiency (POI) increases the lifetime risk of bone fragility, cardiovascular disease, and cognitive impairment. To investigate the effects of environmental pollutants on the occurrence of POI and explore its mechanism, we conducted a computer search for articles published in electronic databases by December 13, 2022. Three reviewers independently examined all included studies and scored the qualities of included studies using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale criteria. In this meta-analysis, eight clinical studies as well as ten preclinical findings showed a pooled OR of 2.331 and 95% CI of 1.968–2.760. This confirms that environmental pollutants, including POPs, heavy metals, PAEs, PAHs, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, and cigarette smoke, are indeed significant risk factors for POI. In addition, it is demonstrated from the results of this study that signaling pathway of calcium and PI3K Akt and Xpnpep2, Col1, Col3, Col4, Cx43, Egr3, Tff1, and Ptgs2 genes may all be involved in the process. Environmental pollutants, including POPs, heavy metals, PAEs, PAHs, cosmetic and pharmaceutical products, and cigarette smoke, are indeed significant risk factors for POI. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Society for Reproductive Investigation.},

	abstract = {Rapid economic growth and urbanization have led to significant changes in the world's consumption patterns. Accelerated urbanization, the spread of the mobile Internet, and the increasing pace of work globally have all contributed to the demand for the food takeaway industry. The rapid development of the takeaway industry inevitably brings convenience to life, and with it comes great environmental pressure from waste packaging materials. While maintaining the convenience of people's lives, further reducing the environmental pollution caused by takeaway packaging materials and promoting the recycling and reuse of takeaway packaging waste need to attract the attention and concern of the whole society. This review systematically and comprehensively introduces common takeaway food types and commonly used packaging materials, analyzes the impacts of discarded takeaway packaging materials on human health and the ecological environment, summarizes the formulation and implementation of relevant policies and regulations, proposes treatment methods and resourceful reuse pathways for discarded takeaway packaging, and also provides an outlook on the development of green takeaway packaging. Currently, only 20% of waste packaging materials are recycled worldwide, and there is still a need to develop more green takeaway packaging materials and continuously improve relevant policies and regulations to promote the sustainable development of the takeaway industry. The review is conducive to further optimizing the takeaway packaging management system, alleviating the environmental pollution problem, and providing feasible solutions and technical guidance for further optimizing takeaway food packaging materials and comprehensive utilization of resources. © 2023},

	abstract = {Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals that have been linked to increased cholesterol levels and thus may have a role in the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Objectives: To investigate associations between PFAS exposure and incident CVD (a combined CVD end-point consisting of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or heart failure) in two independent population-based cohorts in Sweden. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis also including results from previous studies. Methods: In 2,278 subjects aged 45–75 years from the EpiHealth study, the risk of incident CVD in relation to relative plasma levels of perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was investigated. Associations between plasma levels of six PFAS and incident CVD were also examined in the PIVUS-study (n = 1,016, all aged 70 years). In addition, a meta-analysis was performed including three previous prospective studies, together with the results from the present study. Results: There were no overall statistically significant associations between levels of the different PFAS and incident CVD, neither in EpiHealth nor in PIVUS. However, there was a significant sex interaction for PFOS in EpiHealth (p = 0.008), and an inverse association could be seen only in men (Men, HR: 0.68, 95 % CI: 0.52, 0.89) (Women, HR: 1.13, 95 % CI: 0.82, 1.55). A meta-analysis of five independent studies regarding PFOA and incident CVD showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.80 (CI: 0.66, 0.94) when high levels were compared to low levels. Conclusions: This longitudinal study using data from two population-based cohort studies in Sweden did not indicate any increased risk of incident CVD for moderately elevated PFAS levels. A meta-analysis of five independent cohort studies rather indicated a modest inverse association between PFOA levels and incident CVD, further supporting that increasing PFAS levels are not linked to an increased risk of CVD. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Language development starts during the fetal period when the brain is sensitive to endocrine disruptions from environmental contaminants. This systematic review aims to systematically summarize the existing literature on early-life exposure to PFAS and children’s language and communication development, which is an indicator of neurocognitive development. A structured literature search was conducted using three databases, PubMed, Scopus, and CINAHL, last updated in April 2023. The population was defined as children and young adults. PFAS exposure was assessed pre- or postnatally. The outcome was defined as a language and communication ability assessed with validated instruments, parental self-reports, or clinical language disorder diagnoses. In total, 15 studies were identified for subsequent analyses. Thirteen were performed in background-exposed populations and two in highly exposed populations. There were some indications of potential adverse effects; however, these were not consistent across child sex, age of assessment, or PFAS exposure levels. No systematic effect of early-life PFAS exposure on language and communication development was found. These inconclusive findings may partly be explained by the use of general test instruments with limited validity as to children’s language and communication development. Further studies over a wider exposure range using specific language test instruments are needed. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Aims With up to 40% of patients having patellofemoral joint osteoarthritis (PFJ OA), the two arthroplasty options are to replace solely the patellofemoral joint via patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA), or the entire knee via total knee arthroplasty (TKA). The aim of this study was to assess postoperative success of second-generation PFAs compared to TKAs for patients treated for PFJ OA using patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) and domains deemed important by patients following a patient and public involvement meeting. Methods MEDLINE, EMBASE via OVID, CINAHL, and EBSCO were searched from inception to January 2022. Any study addressing surgical treatment of primary patellofemoral joint OA using second generation PFA and TKA in patients aged above 18 years with follow-up data of 30 days were included. Studies relating to OA secondary to trauma were excluded. ROB-2 and ROBINS-I bias tools were used. Results A total of nine studies were included, made up of four randomized controlled trials (domain 1) and five cohort studies (domain 2). PROMs and knee function specific scores developed for reporting TKA were unable to detect any difference between PFA and TKA. There was no significant difference in complications between PFA and TKA. PFAs were found to have a better postoperative range of motion. Conclusion TKA and PFA are both viable options for patients with primary PFJ OA. Over time, we have seen an emphasis on patient satisfaction and better quality of life. Recommending sacrificing healthy medial and lateral compartments to treat patellofemoral joint arthritis should be given further thought. © 2023 Vella-Baldacchino et al.},

	abstract = {Although heritability estimates suggest a role for genetic components, environmental risk factors have been described as relevant in the etiology of attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Several studies have investigated the role of toxicological pollution, i.e., air pollution, heavy metals, POPs, and phthalates. Clear evidence for association of ADHD and environmental factors has not been provided yet. To answer this, we have assessed all available systematic reviews and meta-analyses that focused on the association between pollutant exposure and either ADHD diagnosis or symptoms. More than 1800 studies were screened of which 14 found eligible. We found evidence of a significant role for some pollutants, in particular heavy metals and phthalates, in the increased risk of developing ADHD symptoms. However, at the current stage, data from existing literature also do not allow to weight the role of the different environmental pollutants. We also offer a critical examination of the reviews/meta-analyses and provide indications for future studies in this field. PROSPERO registration: CRD42022341496. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {This systematic review examines the potential of coffee waste as a highly promising adsorbent in the water purification industry. Nanocomposite and activated carbon have been identified and tested as effective adsorbents to remove per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in the water system. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are part of PFAS contaminants which released into the aquatic environment through the textile, food and beverage, medicine, plumbing, and kitchen utensils industries, which cause bioaccumulation and carcinogenic effect if humans are exposed continuously. Commercial nanocomposite and activated carbon are expensive, thereby the production of nanocomposite and activated carbon from biomass waste can be used as an alternative. Coffee residues are biomass wastes which produced in considerable quantities worldwide. Recently, coffee waste as an adsorbent widely used for efficient wastewater treatment. The systematic review collects information related to the abundance of coffee in Indonesia, potential of coffee waste as an adsorbent, the exposure of PFOA and PFOS in environmental, and in-silico study of coffee’s active compounds against PFOA and PFOS ligands in Human Serum Albumin (HSA). The green synthesis method such as microwave irradiation was used for polymer synthesis based on natural materials Coffee’s active compounds revealed that caffeine and theophylline had the highest binding affinity when interacting with PFOA (-6,0 kcal/mol) while paraxanthine with PFOS (-5,9 kcal/mol) ligands. The green synthesis method was used for polymer synthesis based on natural materials, which are widely used for the synthesis of nanocomposite and activated carbon. The in-silico study showed the potential removal of PFOA and PFOS using coffee waste as an adsorbent. © 2023 American Institute of Physics Inc.. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The exposure of farmers to pesticides due to inadequate safety measures is a concern in low-income countries in Africa and Asia. However, until now, there have been limited studies on the farmers’ risk due to pesticide application to fruit crops. The knowledge of farmers’ exposure related to pesticide use and their safety practices was studied among 100 banana farmers in three areas (Padampur, Jagatpur, and Thimura) of Chitwan district, Nepal. More than 75% of the farmers complained about problems related to insects. Most frequently used insecticides in the area were chlorpyrifos and cypermethrin. Ten percent (10%) of the applied pesticides were highly hazardous to humans, according to the World Health Organization hazard category, with skin rash being the most common acute symptom reported by 29% of the farmers. Banned organochlorine and organophosphate insecticides, such as endosulfan and triazophos, respectively, are still being used by farmers in the aforementioned areas. Spearman’s correlation analysis revealed the lack of knowledge and safety practices among farmers leading to inadequate awareness related to the negative effects of pesticide use on human health and the environment. Therefore, government extension service can play a crucial role in improving banana farmers’ knowledge of the toxic effects of pesticides as well as enforcing the Nepali language in the labeling of pesticide containers and packages. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Due to its complex and, often, highly contaminated nature, treating industrial wastewater poses a significant environmental problem. Many of the persistent pollutants found in industrial effluents cannot be effectively removed by conventional treatment procedures. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have emerged as a promising solution, offering versatile and effective means of pollutant removal and mineralization. This comprehensive review explores the application of various AOP strategies in industrial wastewater treatment, focusing on their mechanisms and effectiveness. Ozonation (O3): Ozonation, leveraging ozone (O3), represents a well-established AOP for industrial waste water treatment. Ozone's formidable oxidative potential enables the breakdown of a broad spectrum of organic and inorganic contaminants. This paper provides an in-depth examination of ozone reactions, practical applications, and considerations involved in implementing ozonation. UV/Hydrogen Peroxide (UV/H2O2): The combination of ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has gained prominence as an AOP due to its ability to generate hydroxyl radicals (ȮH), highly efficient in pollutant degradation. The review explores factors influencing the efficiency of UV/H2O2 processes, including H2O2 dosage and UV radiation intensity. Fenton and Photo-Fenton Processes: Fenton's reagent and Photo-Fenton processes employ iron ions and hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals for pollutant oxidation. The paper delves into the mechanisms, catalyst selection, and the role of photoactivation in enhancing degradation rates within the context of industrial wastewater treatment. Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Processes (EAOPs): EAOPs encompass a range of techniques, such as electro-Fenton and anodic oxidation, which employ electrode reactions to produce ȮH radicals. This review explores the electrochemical principles, electrode materials, and operational parameters critical for optimizing EAOPs in industrial wastewater treatment. TiO2 Photocatalysis (UV/TiO2): Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis, driven by UV light, is examined for its potential in industrial wastewater treatment. The review investigates TiO2 catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and the influence of parameters like catalyst loading and UV intensity on pollutant removal. Sonolysis (Ultrasonic Irradiation): High-frequency ultrasound-induced sonolysis represents a unique AOP, generating ȮH radicals during the formation and collapse of cavitation bubbles. This paper delves into the physics of cavitation, sonolytic reactions, and optimization strategies for industrial wastewater treatment. This review offers a critical assessment of the applicability, advantages, and limitations of these AOP strategies in addressing the diverse challenges posed by industrial wastewater. It emphasizes the importance of selecting AOPs tailored to the specific characteristics of industrial effluents and outlines potential directions for future research and practical implementation. The integrated use of these AOPs, when appropriately adapted, holds the potential to achieve sustainable and efficient treatment of industrial wastewater, contributing significantly to environmental preservation and regulatory compliance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: Internal fixation with cephalomedullary nails has been widely used in the treatment of intertrochanteric femoral fractures (IFF). Yet, the difference in efficacy and safety between the commonly used integrated dual-screw cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) and single-screw cephalomedullary nail remains inconclusive. Thus we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies comparing InterTAN with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), the Asian PFNA (PFNA-II), or the Gamma3 nail in treating IFF were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from inception to April 30, 2023. The differences in perioperative parameters and clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated by mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence interval (95%CI). The risks of various complications and mortality were assessed by risk ratio (RR) with 95%CI. Results: Twenty-three studies comprising 3566 patients were included. Compared with single-screw cephalomedullary nails (PFNA/PFNA-II, Gamma3), InterTAN conferred significantly reduced risk of implant failures (RR = 0.37, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.51, P < 0.001), hip and thigh pain (RR = 0.70, 95%CI 0.55 to 0.90, P = 0.006) and all-cause revision/reoperation (RR = 0.38, 95%CI 0.26 to 0.57, P < 0.001). Moreover, patients treated with InterTAN had significantly higher 1-year Harris Hip Score (MD = 0.82, 95%CI 0.20–1.44, P = 0.010) and shorter time to union/healing (MD = − 0.66 days, 95%CI − 1.16 to − 0.16, P = 0.009). Femoral neck shortening, time to full bearing, and incidences of non-union, infection, deep venous thrombosis, and mortality were comparable between both groups. Conclusions: The integrated dual-screw InterTAN construct has superior performance in reducing risks of complications and improving clinical and functional outcomes in the treatment of IFF. More well-designed, high-quality RCTs are warranted to confirm these findings. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent organic pollutants and suspected endocrine disruptors. Objective: The aim of this work was to conduct a systematic review with meta-analysis to summarise the associations between prenatal or childhood exposure to PFASs and childhood overweight/obesity. Methods: The search was performed on the bibliographic databases PubMed and Embase with text strings containing terms related to prenatal, breastfeeding, childhood, overweight, obesity, and PFASs. Only papers describing a biomonitoring study in pregnant women or in children up to 18 years that assessed body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), or fat mass in children were included. When the estimates of the association between a PFAS and an outcome were reported from at least 3 studies, a meta-analysis was conducted; moreover, to correctly compare the studies, we developed a method to convert the different effect estimates and made them comparable each other. Meta-analyses were performed also stratifying by sex and age, and sensitivity analyses were also performed. Results: In total, 484 and 779 articles were retrieved from PubMed and Embase, respectively, resulting in a total of 826 articles after merging duplicates. The papers included in this systematic review were 49: 26 evaluating prenatal exposure to PFASs, 17 childhood exposure, and 6 both. Considering a qualitative evaluation, results were conflicting, with positive, negative, and null associations. 30 papers were included in meta-analyses (19 prenatal, 7 children, and 4 both). Positive associations were evidenced between prenatal PFNA and BMI, between PFOA and BMI in children who were more than 3 years, and between prenatal PFNA and WC. Negative associations were found between prenatal PFOS and BMI in children who were 3 or less years, and between PFHxS and risk of overweight. Relatively more consistent negative associations were evidenced between childhood exposure to three PFASs (PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA) and BMI, in particular PFOS in boys. However, heterogeneity among studies was high. Conclusion: Even though heterogeneous across studies, the pooled evidence suggests possible associations, mostly positive, between prenatal exposure to some PFASs and childhood BMI/WC; and relatively stronger evidence for negative associations between childhood exposure to PFASs and childhood BMI. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Thyroid cancer is considered as one of the most prevalent cancers in the world. Some pesticides can play a role as a potentially important risk factor in thyroid cancer by affecting thyroid morphology and thyroid hormone homeostasis. The aim of present study was to systematically review the available epidemiological evidence for human exposure to pesticides and thyroid cancer. Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science by suitable keywords from January 2000 to May 2021. Standard techniques for systematic reviews were followed in the current study and results reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria, finally seven studies including four cohort studies and three case-control studies were reviewed. Organochlorines (OCPs) in more cases, Organophosphates (OPs) and Carbamates insecticides, herbicides and fungicides were the studied pesticides. Inconsistent results were reported in the surveyed articles on the OCPs. Two articles on the Carbamates (Carbaryl and Mancozeb) showed consistently an inverse association between exposure and thyroid cancer. Increased risk of thyroid cancer due to the exposure to the Malathion was reported in one article on the OPs. Due to the limited current knowledge about the effect of pesticides on thyroid cancer in humans, human health policies must be implemented to control individual’s exposure to chemicals through using of botanical pesticides in agricultural. Also, more studies must be done to fill this gap of knowledge. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Access to clean water remains a challenge in many parts of Africa. This is compounded by the increasing pollution levels with increasing population and industrialization. Activated carbon remains the most widely used adsorbent for the removal of chemical pollutants in both drinking water and wastewater treatment processes due to its unique chemical properties and a plethora of precursor materials for development. However, to date, no available literature has systematically summarized the advances in Africa on the adsorptive removal of contaminants using activated carbons and research issues such as data acquisition and presentation, analysis approaches, citations, inconsistencies and adsorption experimental setups remain largely undocumented. In this paper, adsorption studies from Africa focusing on activated carbons for the removal of various contaminants are reviewed, from 2007 to 2022. The study focused on a literature-based approach by searching key terms in selected databases. The adsorption data were mostly best described by the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models for dyes, anions, metal ions pesticides, and pharmaceutical compounds. According to the pooled data, the highest adsorption capacity was 1552.5 mg g − 1 for PFOS adsorbed onto H3PO4-activated maize tassel-based carbon. The majority of the studies relied on linearized adsorption isotherm and kinetic models with coefficient of determination (R2) as the sole criterion for determining best-fitting models. Additionally, the majority of the studies are batch mode and laboratory-scale studies with no desorption and recyclability evaluations. Researchers should be careful to present accurate equations and units of parameters with proper citations. Pilot-scale and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the reported new materials represent an aspect largely unexplored. The fact that studies from most African countries, dating beyond 2007, could be obtained implies that activated carbons present an accessible and possibly sustainable technology for emerging economies. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The persistent organic pollutant 2,2′,4,4′-Tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), a prevalent congener among polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), exhibits potent bioaccumulation and toxicity. Despite extensive research into the adverse effects of BDE-47, its neurotoxicity in sea cucumbers remains unexplored. Given the crucial role of the sea cucumber's nervous system in survival and adaptation, evaluating the impacts of BDE-47 is vital for sustainable aquaculture and consumption. In this study, we employed ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Triple-TOF-MS) to analyze metabolomic changes in neuro-related tissues of Apostichopus japonicus exposed to low (0.1 µg/L), medium (1.0 µg/L), and high (10.0 µg/L) BDE-47 concentrations. We identified significantly changed metabolites in each exposure group (87 in low, 79 in medium, and 102 in high), affecting a variety of physiological processes such as steroid hormone balance, nucleotide metabolism, energy metabolism, neurotransmitter levels, and neuroprotection. In addition, we identified concentration-dependent, common, and some other metabolic responses in the neuro-related tissues. Our findings reveal critical insights into the neurotoxic effects of BDE-47 in sea cucumbers and contribute to risk assessment related to BDE-47 exposure in the sea cucumber industry, paving the way for future neurotoxicological research in invertebrates. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Exposure to pesticides is associated with an increased risk of developing Parkinson's disease (PD). Currently, rodent-based risk assessment studies cannot adequately capture neurodegenerative effects of pesticides due to a lack of human-relevant endpoints targeted at neurodegeneration. Thus, there is a need for improvement of the risk assessment guidelines. Specifically, a mechanistic assessment strategy, based on human physiology and (patho)biology is needed, which can be applied in next generation risk assessment. The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework is particularly well-suited to provide the mechanistic basis for such a strategy. Here, we conducted a semi-systematic review in Embase and MEDLINE, focused on neurodegeneration and pesticides, to develop an AOP network for parkinsonian motor symptoms. Articles were labelled and included/excluded using the online platform Sysrev. Only primary articles, written in English, focused on effects of pesticides or PD model compounds in models for the brain were included. A total of 66 articles, out of the 1700 screened, was included. PD symptoms are caused by loss of function and ultimately death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Our literature review highlights that a unique feature of these cells that increases their vulnerability is their reliance on continuous low-level influx of calcium. As such, excess intracellular calcium was identified as a central early Key Event (KE). This KE can lead to death of dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and eventually parkinsonian motor symptoms, via four distinct pathways: 1) activation of calpains, 2) endoplasmic reticulum stress, 3) impairment of protein degradation, and 4) oxidative damage. Several receptors have been identified that may serve as molecular initiating events (MIEs) to trigger one or more of these pathways. The proposed AOP network provides the biological basis that can be used to develop a mechanistic testing strategy that captures neurodegenerative effects of pesticides. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Human activities have significantly increased the accessibility of nitrogen and manganese, which has had an impact on the evolution of microorganisms. To investigate the effect of increasing manganese accessibility on microbial nitrogen cycle, Mn-HA (Manganese -Humus chelates), a naturally occurring compound in the form of organochelate, was introduced into the conventional nitrification-denitrification process. The findings revealed that the addition of Mn-HA significantly facilitated the removal of ammonium and nitrate potentially by Mnammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation mediated by Mn (IV)-oxide reduction) and Mn-based autotrophic denitrification. Metagenomic analyses suggested the presence of manganese-redox microorganisms involved in nitrification and denitrification, indicating the occurrence of manganese redox-coupled nitrogen metabolism processes. Additionally, the production and consumption of bio-MnOx (bio-Manganese Oxides) were observed in conjunction with denitrification and nitrification. The production of unequal amounts of bio-MnOx suggested that bio-MnOx may have been deposited in the sediment. This was confirmed by the BCR sequential extraction experiment. Coupling Mn metabolism with N metabolism is an adaptive strategy for nitrogen metabolizing microorganisms. For Mn-sensitive populations, they gain respite from Mn-rich environments by adopting strategies such as manganese oxidation, regulating manganese transport, pumping out intracellular manganese and evolving other manganese resistance genes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Fruit allergies manifest with a diverse array of clinical presentations, ranging from localized contact allergies and oral allergy syndrome to the potential for severe systemic reactions including anaphylaxis. The scope of population-level prevalence studies remains limited, largely derived from single-center or hospital-based investigations. In this comprehensive review, we conducted a systematic literature search spanning the years 2009 to 2023, with full acknowledgment of potential analytical biases, to provide a global overview of fruit allergy prevalence. The primary mechanistic underpinning of fruit allergies stems from cross-reactivity between aeroallergens and food allergens, a consequence of structurally similar epitopes—a phenomenon recognized as pollen food allergy syndrome (PFAS). In the era of molecular allergology, numerous studies have dissected allergen components with substantial clinical relevance. Within this review, we explore important allergenic molecules found in plant-based foods, scrutinize pertinent cross-reactivity patterns, and offer insights into management recommendations. Additionally, we compare guideline recommendations to enhance clinical understanding and inform decision making. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in agricultural soil often triggered metabolic alterations and phytotoxicity in plants, ultimately threatening crop quality. Unraveling the phytotoxic mechanisms of POPs in crops is critical for evaluating their environmental risks. Herein, the molecular mechanism of POP-induced phytotoxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was analyzed using metabolic profile, enzyme activity, and gene expression as linkages, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalate esters. Despite no observable changes in phenotypic traits (e.g., biomass and length of aboveground), the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were promoted under stresses of the tested POPs, particularly 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Metabolomics analysis revealed that ROS contents positively correlated with metabolic perturbation levels (r = 0.83), among which the galactose metabolism was significantly inhibited when exposed to DBP, DEHP, or BDE-47. The α-Galactosidase (α-Gal) involved in galactose metabolism was targeted as the key enzyme for the phytotoxicity of DBP, DEHP, and BDE-47, which was revealed by the inhibition of saccharide levels (45.5−82.1%), the catalytic activity of α-Gal (18.5−24.3%), and the gene expression (28.5−34.5%). Molecular docking simulation suggested that the three POPs occupied the active sites of α-Gal and formed a stable protein-ligand complex, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of α-Gal. Partial least-squares regression analysis indicated that α-Gal activity was negatively associated with hydrogen bond acceptor, rotatable bond, and topological polar surface area of POPs. The results offered novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of phytotoxicity of POPs and provided important information for evaluating the environmental risk of POPs. © 2023},

The use of perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) during pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) reduced the incidence of metamorphopsia (RR = 0.61, 95% CI: 0.41 to 0.92). There was no evidence of any important difference in metamorphopsia between participants in the PPV group and the scleral buckling (SB) group (RR = 1.04, 95% CI: 0.82 to 1.33). There was little or no difference in metamorphopsia between gas and silicon oil (SO) in the PPV group (RR = 0.89, 95% CI: 0.69 to 1.13). Conclusion: The incidence of postoperative metamorphopsia is higher in macular-off RRD, and PFCL should be a preferred choice to prevent postoperative metamorphopsia in macula-off RRD cases. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {Objective: Lilium brownii var. viridulum (LB) and L. lancifolium (LL) are the main sources of medicinal lily (Lilii Bulbus, Baihe in Chinese) in China. However, the functional components of these two species responsible for the treatment efficacy are yet not clear. In order to explore the therapeutic material basis of Lilii Bulbus, we selected L. davidii var. willmottiae (LD) only used for food as the control group to analyze the differences between LD and the other two (LB and LL). Methods: Metabolome and transcriptome were carried out to investigate the differences of active components in LD vs LB and LD vs LL. Data of metabolome and transcriptome was analysed using various analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCH) analysis, and so on. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched through KEGG and GO enrichment analysis. Results: The PCA and HCH analysis of the metabolome indicated the metabolites were clearly separated and varied greatly in LL and LB contrasted with LD. There were 318 significantly differential metabolites (SDMs) in LD vs LB group and 298 SDMs in LD vs LL group. Compared with LD group, the significant up-regulation of steroidal saponins and steroidal alkaloids were detected both in LB and LL groups, especially in LB group. The HCH analysis of transcriptome indicated that there was significant difference in LB vs LD group, while the difference between LL and LD varied slightly. Additionally, 47 540 DEGs in LD vs LB group and 18 958 DEGs in LD vs LL group were identified. Notably, CYP450s involving in the biosynthesis of steroidal saponins and steroidal alkaloids were detected, and comparing with LD, CYP724, CYP710A, and CYP734A1 in LB and CYP90B in LL were all up-regulated. Conclusion: This study suggested that steroidal saponins and steroidal alkaloids maybe the representative functional components of Lilii Bulbus, which can provide new insights for Lilii Bulbus used in the research and development of classic famous formula. © 2024 Tianjin Press of Chinese Herbal Medicines.},

	abstract = {Emerging environmental contaminants have become a crucial environmental issue because of the highly toxic effluents emitted by factories. Ibuprofen (IBP), as a typical anti-inflammatory drug, is frequently detected in water sources. Therefore, its removal using various adsorbents has drawn great interest. Herein, the structural, electronic, energetic, and optical properties of pristine oxo-triarylmethyl (oxTAM) and transition metal-doped oxo-triarylmethyl (TM@oxTAM, TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn) for adsorption of the IBU drug were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations implemented in Gaussian and VASP codes. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO), density of states (DOS), and electronic band structure results demonstrated that transition metal-doped oxTAM causes a significant reduction in the energy band gap (Eg) value of pristine oxTAM, with the highest decrease (30.14 %) in the case of Mn@oxTAM. It was found that transition metal doping onto oxTAM leads to an increase in the adsorption energies (1.20–2.64 eV) and charge density between transition metal and IBU. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed that charge was effectively transferred from the IBU towards the transition metal, which was further analyzed by charge decomposition analysis (CDA). Furthermore, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), interaction region indicator (IRI), electron localization function (ELF), and radial distribution function (RDF) analyses revealed that the IBU is adsorbed on the Sc@oxTAM surface via covalent interactions, while electrostatic with partially covalent interactions are dominated in other IBU/TM@oxTAM complexes. The results suggest that TM doping on the oxTAM provides a new insight for developing photocatalyst-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to remove emerging pollutants in wastewater. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been linked to adverse birth outcomes; however, to date, the available studies on such relations, with the exception of birth weight, has not been systematically synthesized. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the available observational studies on the association of maternal exposure to PAHs and their metabolites during pregnancy with indicators of fetal growth and gestational age at delivery. We searched Web of Science, PubMed and Scopus systematically for all relevant published papers in English until 13 January 2023. Random effects meta-analysis was applied to synthesize the association estimates. Publication bias was assessed using Egger's regression. A total of 31 articles were included in our review (n = 703,080 participants). Our quality assessment of reviewed papers showed that 19 research had excellent, nine had good, and three had fair quality. Most of the reviewed studies on exposure to PAHs and their metabolites with gestational age and preterm birth (seven studies) reported no statistically significant association. Eight studies were eligible for our meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that higher levels of maternal urinary 1-OHP was associated with lower birth weight, birth length and head circumference and a higher risk of low birth weight (LBW). However, these associations were not statistically significant. Similarly, the combined association between maternal urinary 1-OHP and newborn's Ponderal index (PI) and Cephalization index were not statistically significant. Overall, our systematic review and meta-analysis suggested a potential adverse impact of exposure to PAHs on LBW, HC, and CC; however, further studies are required to be able to draw concrete conclusions on such associations. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Short-chain chlorinated paraffins (SCCPs) are an emerging class of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are widely detected in environmental matrices and human samples. Because of their environmental persistence, long-range transport potential, bioaccumulation potential, and biotoxicity, SCCPs pose a significant threat to human health. In this study, metabolomics technology was applied to reveal the metabolomic interference in human normal hepatic (L02) cells after exposure to low (1µg/L), moderate (10µg/L), and high (100100µg) doses of SCCPs. Principal component analysis (PCA) and metabolic effect level index(MELI) values showed that all three SCCP doses caused notable metabolic perturbations in L02 cells. A total of 72 metabolites that were annotated by MS/MS and matched with the experimental spectra in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) or validated by commercially available standards were selected as differential metabolites (DMs) across all groups. The low-dose exposure group shared 33 and 36 DMs with the moderate- and high-dose exposure groups, respectively. The moderate-dose exposure group shared 46 DMs with the high-dose exposure group. In addition, 33 DMs were shared among the three exposure groups. Among the 72 DMs, 9, 9, and 45 metabolites participated in the amino acid, nucleotide, and lipid metabolism pathways, respectively. The results of pathway enrichment analysis showed that the most relevant metabolic pathways affected by SCCPs were the lipid metabolism, fatty acid $\beta$-oxidation, and nucleotide metabolism pathways, and that compared with low-dose exposure, moderate- and high-dose SCCP exposures caused more notable perturbations of these metabolic pathways in L02 cells. Exposure to SCCPs perturbed glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism. Significant alterations in the levels of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and sphingomyelins indicated SCCP-induced biomembrane damage. SCCPs inhibited fatty acid ß-oxidation by decreasing the levels of short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines in L02 cells, indicating that the energy supplied by fatty acid oxidation was reduced in these cells. Furthermore, compared with low- and moderate-dose SCCPs, high-dose SCCPs produced a significantly stronger inhibition of fatty acid $\beta$-oxidation. In addition, SCCPs perturbed nucleotide metabolism. The higher hypoxanthine levels observed in L02 cells after SCCP exposures indicate that SCCPs may induce several adverse effects, including hypoxia, reactive oxygen species production, and mutagenesis in L02 cells. © (2024), (Zhongguo Kexueyuan - Chinese Academy of Sciences).

	abstract = {Cardiometabolic disorders (CMD) are a growing public health problem across the world. Among the known cardiometabolic risk factors are compounds that induce endocrine and metabolic dysfunctions, such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs). To date, how EDCs influence molecular programs and cardiometabolic risks has yet to be fully elucidated, especially considering the complexity contributed by species-, chemical-, and dose-specific effects. Moreover, different experimental and analytical methodologies employed by different studies pose challenges when comparing findings across studies. To explore the molecular mechanisms of EDCs in a systematic manner, we established a data-driven computational approach to meta-analyze 30 human, mouse, and rat liver transcriptomic datasets for 4 EDCs, namely bisphenol A (BPA), bis(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), tributyltin (TBT), and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Our computational pipeline uniformly re-analyzed pre-processed quality-controlled microarray data and raw RNAseq data, derived differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and biological pathways, modeled gene regulatory networks and regulators, and determined CMD associations based on gene overlap analysis. Our approach revealed that DEHP and PFOA shared stable transcriptomic signatures that are enriched for genes associated with CMDs, suggesting similar mechanisms of action such as perturbations of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) signaling and liver gene network regulators VNN1 and ACOT2. In contrast, TBT exhibited highly divergent gene signatures, pathways, network regulators, and disease associations from the other EDCs. In addition, we found that the rat, mouse, and human BPA studies showed highly variable transcriptomic patterns, providing molecular support for the variability in BPA responses. Our work offers insights into the commonality and differences in the molecular mechanisms of various EDCs and establishes a streamlined data-driven workflow to compare molecular mechanisms of environmental substances to elucidate the underlying connections between chemical exposure and disease risks. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Emerging epidemiological evidence indicates potential associations between gestational perfluorobutane sulfonate (PFBS) exposure and adverse metabolic outcomes in offspring. However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate PFBS exposure effects during pregnancy and lactation on rat offspring lipid profiles and the possible underlying mechanisms. Although the biochemical index difference including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), alanine amino transaminase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), and fasting blood glucose between exposed groups and the control group was not significant, transcriptome analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 50 mg/kg/day PFBS exposure group were significantly related to protein digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, xenobiotic metabolism by cytochrome P450, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, β-alanine metabolism, bile secretion, unsaturated fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis, and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. Untargeted metabolomics analyses identified 17 differential metabolites in the 50 mg/kg/day PFBS exposure group. Among these, phosphatidylserine [PS (18:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z))], lysoPE (18:1(11Z)/0:0), and PS (14:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) were significantly correlated with phospholipid metabolism disorders. Correlation analysis indicated the DEGs, including FA binding protein (Fabp4), spermine oxidase (Smox), Fabp2, acyl-CoA thioesterase 5 (Acot5), sarcosine dehydrogenase (Sardh), and amine oxidase, copper-containing 3 (Aoc3) that significantly enriched in xenobiotic metabolism by cytochrome P450 and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism signaling pathways were highly related to the differential metabolite pantetheine 4’−phosphate. Pantetheine 4′-phosphate was significantly negatively associated with non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) and TC levels. Collectively, our study indicated that maternal PFBS exposure at a relatively low level could alter gene expression and metabolic molecules in lipid metabolism-related pathway series in rat offspring, although the effects on metabolic phenotypes were not significant within the limited observational period, using group-wise and trend analyses. © 2023},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: Organochlorine pesticides (OCP) have been proposed as potential mammary carcinogens since they interact with steroid signaling pathways. However, the epidemiological results are not conclusive. Most studies have evaluated breast cancer (BC) as a single entity without considering the different molecular expressions, including estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2, that could differ in their association with these contaminants. Hence, we assessed the association between biological concentration of OCP and BC, according to its molecular receptor expression, based on a systematic review and meta-analysis. Recent Findings: Of the 141 articles eligible for full-text review, nine met the inclusion criteria. The way in which molecular expression was reported was heterogeneous; therefore, the inclusion of studies in the meta-analysis was limited to eight articles. A negative association was identified for β-hexachlorocyclohexane and trans-nonachlor with ER + tumors and between hexachlorobenzene and ER − tumors. No associations were observed for p,p′-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene, cis-nonachlor, and dieldrin, and it was not possible to evaluate the associations between OCP with HER2 expression or triple-negative tumors due to lack of data. Summary: The results suggest that some OCP might be associated with BC depending on the expression of ER. However, the evidence is not conclusive due to the scarce data. We identified several methodological aspects to fill the gaps in knowledge and increase the comparability among studies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {As the concerned emerging pollutants, several lines of evidence have indicated that nanoplastics (NPs) lead to reproductive toxicity. However, the biological mechanism underlying NPs disturbed spermatogenesis remains largely unknown. Therefore, we aimed to reveal the potential mechanism of impaired spermatogenesis caused by long-term NPs exposure from the perspective of integrated metabolome and microbiome analysis. After 12 weeks of gavage of polystyrene nanoplastics (PS-NPs) and animo-modified polystyrene nanoplastics (Amino-NPs), a well-designed two-exposure stages experimental condition. We found that NPs exposure induced apparent abnormal spermatogenesis, which appeared more severe in the Amino-NPs group. Mechanistically, 14 floras associated with glucose and lipid metabolism were significantly altered, as evidenced by 16 S rRNA sequencing. Testicular metabolome revealed that the Top 50 changed metabolites were also enriched in lipid metabolism. Subsequently, the combined gut microbiome and metabolome analysis uncovered the strong correlations between Klebsiella, Blautia, Parabacteroides, and lipid metabolites (e.g., PC, LysoPC and GPCho). We speculate that the dysbiosis of gut microbiota-related disturbed lipid metabolism may be responsible for long-term NPs-induced damaged spermatogenesis, which provides new insights into NPs-induced dysregulated spermatogenesis. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The prenatal environment influences lifetime health; epigenetic mechanisms likely predominate. In 2016, the first international consortium paper on cigarette smoking during pregnancy and offspring DNA methylation identified extensive, reproducible exposure signals. This finding raised expectations for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of other exposures. OBJECTIVE: We review the current state-of-the-science for DNA methylation associations across prenatal exposures in humans and provide future recommendations. METHODS: We reviewed 134 prenatal environmental EWAS of DNA methylation in newborns, focusing on 51 epidemiological studies with meta-analysis or replication testing. Exposures spanned cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, air pollution, dietary factors, psychosocial stress, metals, other chemicals, and other exogenous factors. Of the reproducible DNA methylation signatures, we examined implementation as exposure biomarkers. RESULTS: Only 19 (14%) of these prenatal EWAS were conducted in cohorts of 1,000 or more individuals, reflecting the still early stage of the field. To date, the largest perinatal EWAS sample size was 6,685 participants. For comparison, the most recent genome-wide association study for birth weight included more than 300,000 individuals. Replication, at some level, was successful with exposures to cigarette smoking, folate, dietary glycemic index, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 lm and <2:5 lm, nitrogen dioxide, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, electronic waste, PFAS, and DDT. Reproducible effects of a more limited set of prenatal exposures (smoking, folate) enabled robust methylation biomarker creation. DISCUSSION: Current evidence demonstrates the scientific premise for reproducible DNA methylation exposure signatures. Better powered EWAS could identify signatures across many exposures and enable comprehensive biomarker development. Whether methylation biomarkers of exposures themselves cause health effects remains unclear. We expect that larger EWAS with enhanced coverage of epigenome and exposome, along with improved single-cell technologies and evolving methods for integrative multi-omics analyses and causal inference, will expand mechanistic under-standing of causal links between environmental exposures, the epigenome, and health outcomes throughout the life course. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12956. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

	abstract = {Sustainable ecosystem is of essence to the river for its survival and maintenance of ecological balance. Gomti river, a groundwater-fed tributary of the Holy Ganges, is the lifeline of the middle Indo-Gangetic Plains. Screening of river pollutants for river cleanup is a challenging task. To this end, 20 km Lucknow stretch of Gomti was sampled at 5 locations for physicochemical–bacteriological analysis. Collected samples were analyzed for pH, TA, turbidity, DO, BOD, TH, COD, TDS, fecal coliform, and E. coli. Analytical instruments AAS and GC-ECD were used for heavy metal and organochlorine pesticide analysis. DO was 3.2 ± 0.3 to 7.4 ± 0.4 (avg 5 ± 1.8) mg/l, BOD was 10.6 ± 0.5 to 41 ± 1.7 (avg 22.9 ± 13.3) mg/l, while COD was 26.6 ± 4.6 to 93.5 ± 4.6 (avg 56 ± 31.3) mg/l. WQI values gradually increased from S1 (56.7) to S5 (181.8) which denotes a significant deterioration of water quality downstream of the river. Cd, Mn, Fe, Pb, and Cr had increment of 64, 18, 12, 6, and 2 fold, respectively, as compared to individual BIS:10500 standards. Among the OCPs, concentrations were in the order: aldrin > pp-DDT > β-HCH > γ-HCH > α-endosulfan > pp-DDE > α-HCH. Statistically strong positive correlation (r > 0.95 at 0.01) was observed among physicochemical parameters. Furthermore, bacterial species Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. Achromogenes, Aeromonas salmonicida strain A527, Aeromonas encheleia strain NCTC12917, and Aeromonas salmonicida strain ATCC33658 were identified by 16S rRNA gene amplification and molecular phylogenetic analysis. The study indicated heavy contamination of the river with organic and inorganic pollutants owing to mixing of untreated sewage, industrial effluents, and associated toxicants along with pathogenic bacteria which are a barrier to the harmony of aquatic life.

	abstract = {Along with the typical biochemical alterations that occur during pregnancy, certain metabolic changes might be associated with the development of several psychiatric disorders, including postpartum depression (PPD), which is the most common type of psychiatric disorder during pregnancy or first postpartum year, and it develops in about 15% of women. Metabolomics is a rapidly developing discipline that deals with the metabolites as the final products of all genetically controlled biochemical pathways, highly influenced by external and internal changes. The aim of this paper was to review the published studies whose results suggest or deny a possible association between the fine regulation of the metabolome and PPD, enabling conclusions about whether metabolomics could be a useful tool in defining the biochemical pathways directly involved in the etiology, diagnosis and course of PPD. Beside numerous hormonal changes, a lot of different metabolic pathways have been discovered to be affected in women with PPD or associated with its development, including alterations in the energy metabolism, tryptophan and amino acid metabolism, steroid metabolism, purine cycle, as well as neurotransmitter metabolism. Additionally, metabolomics helped in defining the association between PPD and the exposure to various endocrine disrupting metabolites during pregnancy. Finally, metabolome reflects different PPD therapies and exposure of fetus or breastfed infants to pharmacotherapy prescribed to a mother suffering from PPD. This review can help in creating the picture about metabolomics' broad application in PPD studies, but it also implies that its potential is still not completely used. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Prenatal exposure to single chemicals belonging to the per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) family is associated with biological perturbations in the mother, fetus, and placenta, plus adverse health outcomes. Despite our knowledge that humans are exposed to multiple PFAS, the potential joint effects of PFAS on the metabolome remain largely unknown. Here, we leveraged high-resolution metabolomics to identify metabolites and metabolic pathways perturbed by exposure to a PFAS mixture during pregnancy. Targeted assessment of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), along with untargeted metabolomics profiling, were conducted on nonfasting serum samples collected from pregnant African Americans at 6-17 weeks gestation. We estimated the overall mixture effect and partial effects using quantile g-computation and single-chemical effects using linear regression. All models were adjusted for maternal age, education, parity, early pregnancy body mass index, substance use, and gestational weeks at sample collection. Our analytic sample included 268 participants and was socioeconomically diverse, with the majority receiving public health insurance (78%). We observed 13.3% of the detected metabolic features were associated with the PFAS mixture (n = 1705, p < 0.05), which was more than any of the single PFAS chemicals. There was a consistent association with metabolic pathways indicative of systemic inflammation and oxidative stress (e.g., glutathione, histidine, leukotriene, linoleic acid, prostaglandins, and vitamins A, C, D, and E metabolism) across all metabolome-wide association studies. Twenty-six metabolites were validated against authenticated compounds and associated with the PFAS mixture (p < 0.05). Based on quantile g-computation weights, PFNA contributed the most to the overall mixture effect for γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), tyrosine, and uracil. In one of the first studies of its kind, we demonstrate the feasibility and utility of using methods designed for exposure mixtures in conjunction with metabolomics to assess the potential joint effects of multiple PFAS chemicals on the human metabolome. We identified more pronounced metabolic perturbations associated with the PFAS mixture than for single PFAS chemicals. Taken together, our findings illustrate the potential for integrating environmental mixture analyses and high-throughput metabolomics to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying human health. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in drinking water are environmental issues that require special attention. The objective of this study was to know the effects of PFASs on microbial communities and their functional genes from source water to tap water. PFASs were detected by mass-labeled internal standards method, and the microbial communities and functional genes were analyzed by metagenomics. Our results indicated that the concentration of total PFASs in the water ranged from 47.7 to 171.4 ng/L, with perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) being the dominant types. The PFASs concentration decreased slowly from source to tap water in some months. PFBA, PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) influenced the functional genes related to two-component system, bacterial secretion system and flagellar assembly of Aquabacterium, Methylobacterium, and Curvibacter, which contributed significantly to macB and evgS. Therefore, the bacterial communities enhanced adaptation to fluctuating environments by upregulating some functional genes under the PFASs stress, with concomitant changes in the expression of ARGs. Moreover, PFASs also promoted the expression of functional genes associated with human diseases, such as shigellosis and tuberculosis, which increased the risk of human pathogenicity. The bench scale experiment results also suggested that PFOA and PFOS in drinking water can promote the ARGs proliferation and induce microbial risk. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to prevent the risks caused by PFASs and ARGs in drinking water. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introduction: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent chemicals used in many industries and everyday consumer products and exposure has been linked to several adverse health outcomes. Currently, no systematic monitoring of PFAS levels in the general Danish population has been conducted. Objective: To study temporal trends of PFAS concentrations in the Danish population. Materials and methods: In August 2023, we performed a search for original peer-reviewed reports in PubMed using combinations of search terms for PFAS and Denmark. Reports were included if they comprised a Danish study population and direct measurements of PFAS in serum or plasma samples. Scatter plots of medians presented in the reports were used to visualize time-trends of PFAS concentrations among Danish individuals. Results: We included 29 reports based on a total of 18,231 individuals from 19 Danish study populations. A total of 24 PFAS measured in serum or plasma were presented in the reports, the most frequent being PFOS, PFOA, PFDA, PFNA, PFHpA, PFHpS, and PFHxS. Median concentrations of PFOS ranged from 4.0 ng/mL to 44.5 ng/mL, PFOA ranged from 0.8 ng/mL to 9.7 ng/mL, while lower concentrations were presented for the other PFAS. Median concentrations of PFOS and PFOA increased from 1988 until the late 1990s followed by a decrease until 2021. A less clear time-trend were observed for the other PFAS. Conclusion: Blood concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in the Danish population have declined substantially from the late 1990s until 2021 reflecting a phase-out of the production and regulation of the use of these PFAS. Time-trends for PFDA, PFNA, PFHpA, PFHpS, and PFHxS were less evident, yet a tendency toward a decline was observed. As only some of the compounds are measured, it is not possible to determine if the decrease in some PFAS is outweighed by an increase in others. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Although numerous studies have examined the effect of prenatal per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure on neurodevelopment in children, findings have been inconsistent. Objective: To better understand the effects of PFAS exposure during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopment, we conducted a systematic review of prenatal exposure to different types of PFAS and neurodevelopment in children. Methods: A comprehensive search was conducted in the PubMed, Web of Science, and EMBASE electronic databases up to March 2023. Only birth cohort studies that report a specific association between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and neurodevelopment were included in this review. Results: 31 birth cohort studies that met the inclusion criteria were qualitatively integrated. Among these, 14 studies investigated the impact of PFAS exposure during pregnancy on cognition, 13 on neurobehavior, and 4 on both cognition and neurobehavior. Additionally, 4 studies explored the influence of PFAS on children's comprehensive development. Conclusion: Prenatal PFAS exposure was associated with poor neurodevelopment in children, including psychomotor development, externalizing behavior, and comprehensive development. However, conclusive evidence regarding its effects on other neurological outcomes remains limited. In addition, sex-specific effects on social behavior and sleep problems were identified. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

Objectives: To systematically review the clinical outcomes, re-operation, and complication rates of lumbar TDR devices at mid-to long-term follow-up studies for the treatment of lumbar degenerative disc disease (DDD). Methods: A systematic search was conducted on PubMed, SCOPUS, and Google Scholar to identify follow-up studies that evaluated clinical outcomes of lumbar TDR in patients with DDD. The included studies met the following criteria: prospective or retrospective studies published from 2012 to 2022; a minimum of 5 years post-operative follow-up; a study sample size >10 patients; patients >18 years of age; containing clinical outcomes with Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), Visual Analog Scale (VAS), complication or reoperation rates. Results: Twenty-two studies were included with data on 2284 patients. The mean follow-up time was 8.30 years, with a mean follow-up rate of 86.91%. The study population was 54.97% female, with a mean age of 42.34 years. The mean VAS and ODI pain score improvements were 50.71 ± 6.91 and 30.39 ± 5.32 respectively. The mean clinical success and patient satisfaction rates were 74.79% ± 7.55% and 86.34% ± 5.64%, respectively. The mean complication and reoperation rates were 18.53% ± 6.33% and 13.6% ± 3.83%, respectively. There was no significant difference when comparing mid-term and long-term follow-up studies for all clinical outcomes. Conclusions: There were significant improvements in pain reduction at last follow-up in patients with TDRs. Mid-term follow-up data on clinical outcomes, complication and reoperation rates of lumbar TDRs were maintained longer term. © The Author(s) 2024.},

	abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) accumulated in the adipose tissue can affect the fatty acid and lipid metabolism in the body. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) metabolomics analysis was carried out to study the metabolic changes induced by internal exposure to the POPs in mouse skeletal muscle (soleus, plantaris, and gastrocnemius), kidney, heart, and lungs. Male donor mice were injected with a mixture of 10 POPs at concentrations of 0 × and 5 × lowest-observed-adverse-effect level (LOAEL). Their adipose tissue (AT) containing the POP was then grafted onto the host mice and the metabolic change of the host mice was monitored for 3 or 21 days. The metabolites related to fatty acid and lipid metabolism were studied. For the host mice engrafted with POP-containing fat pad, there was dysregulation of the fatty acids and glycerides observed in all the organs studied 3 days after the graft. However, there was no longer a significant change in the metabolites 21 days after the graft. The difference in significant values and metabolite regulation in each of the skeletal muscles showed that the POP mixture affects different types of skeletal muscle in a heterogeneous manner. Fold change analysis showed that certain metabolites in the kidney of host mice exposed to POPs for 3 days were greatly affected. Using multivariate analysis, apart from the plantaris, most treated groups exposed to POPs for 3 days are well distinguished from the control groups. However, for host mice exposed to POPs for 21 days, apart from the kidney and heart, groups are not well-distinguished from the control group. This study helps bring new insight into the effects of the pollutants mixture released from AT on fatty acid and lipid metabolism at different periods and how the dysregulation of metabolites might result in diseases associated with the organs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large group of synthetic chemicals that have been in use for over 70 years. Their ubiquitous distribution and harmful effects pose a threat to wildlife worldwide. To provide a comprehensive synopsis and show the gaps and gluts of existing research on PFAS exposure in wildlife, we created a systematic map and bibliographic analysis of the literature. We followed our protocol to conduct a systematic literature search on Scopus, Web of Science and five other databases. In two steps (title/abstract/keywords and full-text), we screened peer-reviewed empirical articles, preprints and theses in English that studied the concentration of at least one of 34 PFAS compounds in free-ranging wildlife or their parts/products. Following the protocol, we extracted data and performed a critical appraisal. We included 581 publications. From the first and only paper in 2001, there was a linear annual increase to 54 papers in 2021. While PFOS (97% of studies), PFOA (91%) and long-chain PFAS in general were the most measured, few studies investigated new-generation PFAS (e.g. GenX and ADONA). Across the studied 1042 species from 26 taxonomic classes, the most frequent were the common carp (Cyprinus carpio, 8%), polar bear (Ursus maritimus, 6%) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis, 5%). Most sampling took place in the United States (17%), Norway (13%), Canada (12%) and China (10%), which were also the main publishing countries. Polar regions attracted significant research interest from countries all around the globe. Aquatic habitats (marine: 31%, freshwater: 28%) of temperate zones were the most common locations for sample collection. We encourage researchers to work towards closing the following gaps: investigating new-generation PFAS, assessing PFAS in mid- and low-income countries and performing more long-term studies, especially on invertebrates. We note the recent rise in studies on the physiological consequences of PFAS exposure and encourage further work on this crucial topic. Furthermore, we recommend that the statement of potential and actual conflicts of interest, and the provision of raw data and analysis code should be made compulsory by all journals and routinely enforced. This practice will mitigate conflict of interest and ensure reproducibility. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Marine mammals are recognized sentinels of ecosystem health. They are susceptible to the accumulation and biomagnification of pollutants, which constitute one of the greatest threats to their survival. Legacy, such as organochlorine pesticides, and emerging contaminants, like microplastics and pharmaceuticals, may have effects on marine mammals' health at individual and population levels. Therefore, the evaluation of the risks associated with pollutants in this group is of great importance. The aim of this review is to provide information on the occurrence of legacy and emerging contaminants in marine mammals that inhabit Argentine waters. Also, to identify knowledge gaps and suggest best practices for future research. Reports of legacy contaminants referring to organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls were found in five species of cetaceans and two of pinnipeds. With respect to emerging pollutants, the presence of plastics was only evaluated in three species. Reported data was from at least a decade ago. Therefore, it is necessary to update existing information and conduct continuous monitoring to assess temporary trends in pollutants. All the studies were carried out in the province of Buenos Aires and Northern Patagonia indicating a knowledge gap in the southern zone of the Argentine Sea. In addition, pollutants of global environmental concern that have not been studied in Argentina are discussed. Future studies should fill these gaps and a greater effort to understand the relationships between pollutants and their effects on marine mammals is suggested.

	abstract = {Introduction: Per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are a large, complex group of synthetic chemicals humans can be exposed to from occupational or environmental sources. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examined the association between PFAS exposure, particularly Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), and Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid (PFOS), and risk of kidney, liver, and testicular cancer. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed to identify cohort and case-control studies reported after the Monograph of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the Toxicological Profile of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. We assessed the quality of the studies by using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Forest relative risk (RR) plots were constructed for liver, kidney, and testicular cancer. We conducted stratified analyses by geographic region, study design, quality score, outcome, years of publication, exposure source, and PFAS type. A random-effects model was used to address heterogeneity between studies. Results: Fifteen studies, including ten cohort studies, three case-control studies nested in a cohort, and two case-control studies were included after removing duplicate and irrelevant reports. We found an association between overall PFAS exposure and the risk of kidney cancers (RR=1.18, 95% CI =1.05-1.32; I =52.8%, 11 studies). Also, we showed an association between high-level exposure to PFAS and kidney cancer (RR=1.74, 95% CI =1.23-2.47; p=0.005) and testicular cancer (RR=2.22, 95% CI =1.12-4.39; p=0.057). There was no association with liver cancer. We found no heterogeneity by geographical region, PFAS type, study design, outcome, quality score, year of publication, or exposure source. Only two studies reported results among women. Conclusions: We detected an association between overall PFAS exposure and kidney cancer and high doses of PFAS with testicular cancer. However, bias and confounding cannot be excluded, precluding a conclusion in terms of causality. © 2023, Mattioli 1885. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Owing to its difficulty in degrading and ease of accumulation in the body, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has a detrimental effect on reproduction. This study aimed to examine the effect of PFOA concentration in follicular fluid during ovulation stimulation on embryo quality and the impact of PFOA exposure on the metabolic components of follicular fluid. This was a single-center prospective study that included 25 patients with diminished ovarian reserve (DOR), 25 with normal ovarian reserve (NOR), and 25 with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). Follicular fluid samples were analyzed using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. We demonstrated that the PFOA levels of follicular fluid in the DOR group were higher than those in the NOR group and PCOS group (P < 0.05). PFOA concentration in the PCOS group was negatively correlated with high-quality embryos (P < 0.05). To gain more insight into the impact of PFOA on the metabolic composition of follicular fluid, we classified the DOR group based on the PFOA concentration, for which metabolomic analysis was performed. In the high-concentration PFOA group, there was an increase and a decrease in three and nine metabolites, respectively, compared to that in the low-concentration group. These results suggest that PFOA may alter the metabolic composition of follicular fluid, thus, affecting ovarian reserve function. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are used for their properties such as stain and water resistance. The substances have been associated with adverse health outcomes in both pregnant mothers and infants, including pre-eclampsia and low birthweight. A growing body of research suggests that PFAS are transferred from mother to fetus through the placenta, leading to in utero exposure. A systematic review was performed using the PubMed database to search for studies evaluating determinants of PFAS concentrations in blood matrices of pregnant mothers and neonates shortly after birth. Studies were included in this review if an observational study design was utilized, exposure to at least one PFAS analyte was measured, PFAS were measured in maternal or neonatal matrices, at least one determinant of PFAS concentrations was assessed, and results such as beta estimates were provided. We identified 35 studies for inclusion in the review and evaluated the PFAS and determinant relationships among the factors collected in these studies. Parity, breastfeeding history, maternal race and country of origin, and household income had the strongest and most consistent evidence to support their roles as determinants of certain PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers. Reported study findings on smoking status, alcohol consumption, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) suggest that these factors are not important determinants of PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers or neonates. Further study into informative factors such as consumer product use, detailed dietary information, and consumed water sources as potential determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is needed. Research on determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is critical to estimate past PFAS exposure, build improved exposure models, and further our understanding on dose–response relationships, which can influence epidemiological studies and risk assessment evaluations. Given the potential for adverse outcomes in pregnant mothers and neonates exposed to PFAS, it is important to identify and understand determinants of maternal and neonatal PFAS concentrations to better implement public health interventions in these populations. © 2023, The Author(s).},

The samples were digested with acid mixture in Teflon vessels and the technique of inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES) and mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was applied for the analysis of 20 elements (Al, As, Ba, Ca, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Sr, V and Zn). The multivariate statistical method was employed for the statistical processing of the data using cluster and factor analysis. Four groups of elements were identified, three of which were with geogenic factors: (Co, Cr, Ni, Fe, Mg), (Ba, K, Na, V), (Al, Ca, Sr) and one with local enrichment tendencies (anthropogenic origin) (Pb, Zn). The data obtained show natural presence of the analyzed elements and low concentration of heavy metals in the entire territory of Kosovo, with the exception of some areas where higher levels of concentration are shown as a result of the influence of the anthropogenic factor. © 2023 Taylor & Francis.},

	abstract = {The rise of plasticulture as mulching material in farming systems has raised concerns about microplastics (MPs) in the agricultural landscape. MPs are emerging pollutants in croplands and water systems with significant ecological risks, particularly over the long term. In the soil systems, MPs polymer type, thinness, shape, and size induces numerous effects on soil aggregates, dissolved organic carbon (C), rapidly oxidized organic C, microbial biomass C, microbial biomass nitrogen (N), microbial immobilization, degradation of organic matter, N cycling, and production of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), thereby posing a significant risk of impairing soil physical and biochemical properties over time. Further, toxic chemicals released from polyethylene mulching (PMs) might indirectly harm plant growth by affecting soil wetting-drying cycles, releasing toxic substances that interact with soil matrix, and suppressing soil microbial activity. In the environment, accumulation of MPs poses a risk to human health by accelerating emissions of GHGs, e.g., methane and carbon dioxide, or directly releasing toxic substances such as phthalic acid esters (PAEs) into the soils. Also, larger sizes MPs can adhere to root surface and block stomata could significantly change the shape of root epidermal cells resulting in arrest plant growth and development by restricting water-nutrient uptake, and gene expression and altering the biodiversity of the soil pollutants. In this review, we systematically analyzed the potential risks of MPs to the soil-plant and human body, their occurrence, abundance, and migration in agroecosystems. Further, the impacts of MPs on soil microbial function, nutrient cycling, soil C, and GHGs are mechanistically reviewed, with emphasis on potential green solutions such as organic materials amendments along with future research directions for more eco-friendly and sustainable plastic management in agroecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been manufactured for over seven decades. Owing to the unique characteristics of C-F bond, it has been widely used in the industrial and commercial products, which leading to its wide presence in the environmental and biological matrix. In this critical review, we systematically summarized the existing literature on the behaviors and mechanisms of bioaccumulation, transportation, and elimination of PFAS in humans and pointed out the deficiencies and gaps of the existing research. Additionally, we calculated the binding affinities between a total of 56 PFAS and four important renal PFAS transporters (organic anion transporter 1, 3, and 4, together with urate transporter 4) to elucidate the renal elimination behaviors of PFAS in human body by molecular docking method for the first time. Furthermore, we put forwarded perspectives for future research to call on researchers to fill in the gaps of the existing studies and increase the investigations on the research topic. The understanding of the behaviors and mechanisms of PFAS in human beings are significant for the health risks assessment of human exposed to PFAS. Nevertheless, the research on the topic is still very limited. This review provides a comprehensive view of PFAS in human body, explores the potential human renal elimination mechanisms of PFAS, and presents insightful perspectives for further research on the relationship between PFAS exposure and its potential health effects on human beings. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

The ranking of countries based on the pooled (Mean) concentration of TBBP-A in fish was as follows: China (1.157 μg/kg-ww) > Czech Republic (1.027 μg/kg-ww) > France (0.500 μg/kg-ww) ∼Switzerland (0.500 μg/kg-ww) > Netherlands (0.405 μg/kg-ww) > Germany (0.33 μg/kg-ww) > Sweden (0.165 μg/kg-ww)>UK (0.078 μg/kg-ww) > Belgium (0.065 μg/kg-ww) > South Korea (0.013 μg/kg-ww) ∼Japan (0.013 μg/kg-ww) > Ireland (0.005 μg/kg-ww). The risk assessment showed that the carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks of TBBP-A in China and France are higher compared to other countries; however, within all countries, these risks were found to be within acceptable limits.  © 2024 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Background: Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a complex endocrine and metabolic disorder that is common in women of reproductive age. The clinical features of PCOS include hyperandrogenemia and polycystic ovarian changes. Bailing capsule (BL), a proprietary Chinese medicine that contains fermented Cordyceps sinensis powder, has been applied to treat PCOS. However, the specific active ingredients of BL and its mechanisms of action are yet to be elucidated. Methods: Initially, the effectiveness of BL on PCOS model mice was evaluated. Subsequently, the active ingredients of BL were searched in the TCMSP and TCM Systems Pharmacology databases, and their targets were predicted using Swiss Target Prediction and SEA databases. Furthermore, the GEO gene database was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to PCOS. Data from Gene Card, OMIM, DDT, and Drugbank databases were then combined to establish a PCOS disease gene library. Cross targets were imported into the STRING database to construct a protein–protein interaction network. In addition, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape and DAVID databases and visualized using Cytoscape software and R 4.2.3. The core targets were docked with SYBYL-X software, and their expressions in PCOS mice were further verified using qPCR. Results: The core active ingredients of BL were identified to be linoleyl acetate, cholesteryl palmitate, arachidonic acid, among others. Microarray data sets from four groups containing disease and normal samples were obtained from the GEO database. A total of 491 DEGs and 106 drug–disease cross genes were selected. Estrous cycle and ovarian lesions were found to be improved in PCOS model mice following BL treatment. While the levels of testosterone, progesterone, and prolactin decreased, that of estradiol increased. qPCR findings indicated that the expressions of JAK2, PPARG, PI3K, and AKT1 were upregulated, whereas those of ESR1 and IRS1 were downregulated in PCOS model mice. After the administration of BL, the expressions of associated genes were regulated. This study demonstrated that BL exerted anti-PCOS effects via PIK3CA, ESR1, AKT, PPARG, and IRS1 targets affecting PI3K-Akt signaling pathways. Discussion: This research clarified the multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel action of BL and provided a theoretical reference for further investigations on its pharmacological basis and molecular mechanisms against PCOS. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: The global production and use of plastic materials has increased dramatically since the 1960s and there is increasing evidence of human health impacts related to exposure to plastic-associated chemicals. There is, however, no comprehensive, regulatory, post-market monitoring for human health effects of plastic-associated chemicals or particles and it is unclear how many of these have been investigated for effects in humans, and therefore what the knowledge gaps are. Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of peer-reviewed human studies investigating the potential effects of exposure to plastic-associated particles/chemicals on health to identify research gaps and provide recommendations for future research and regulation policy. Methods: Medline and Embase databases were used to identify peer-reviewed primary human studies published in English from Jan 1960 – Jan 2022 that investigated relationships between exposures to included plastic-associated particles/chemicals measured and detected in bio-samples and human health outcomes. Plastic-associated particles/chemicals included are: micro and nanoplastics, due to their widespread occurrence and potential for human exposure; polymers, the main building blocks of plastic; plasticizers and flame retardants, the two most common types of plastic additives with the highest concentration ranges in plastic materials; and bisphenols and per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances, two chemical classes of known health concern that are common in plastics. We extracted metadata on the population and study characteristics (country, intergenerational, sex, age, general/special exposure risk status, study design), exposure (plastic-associated particle/chemical, multiple exposures), and health outcome measures (biochemical, physiological, and/or clinical), from which we produced the interactive database ‘Plastic Health Map’ and a narrative summary. Results: We identified 100,949 unique articles, of which 3,587 met our inclusion criteria and were used to create a systematic evidence map. The Plastic Health Map with extracted metadata from included studies are freely available at https://osf.io/fhw7d/ and summary tables, plots and overall observations are included in this report. Conclusions: We present the first evidence map compiling human health research on a wide range of plastic-associated chemicals from several different chemical classes, in order to provide stakeholders, including researchers, regulators, and concerned individuals, with an efficient way to access published literature on the matter and determine knowledge gaps. We also provide examples of data clusters to facilitate systematic reviews and research gaps to help direct future research efforts. Extensive gaps are identified in the breadth of populations, exposures and outcomes addressed in studies of potential human health effects of plastic-associated chemicals. No studies of the human health effects of micro and/or nanoplastics were found, and no studies were found for 26/1,202 additives included in our search that are of known hazard concern and confirmed to be in active production. Few studies have addressed recent “substitution” chemicals for restricted additives such as organophosphate flame retardants, phthalate substitutes, and bisphenol analogues. We call for a paradigm shift in chemical regulation whereby new plastic chemicals are rigorously tested for safety before being introduced in consumer products, with ongoing post-introduction biomonitoring of their levels in humans and health effects throughout individuals’ life span, including in old age and across generations. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Strict measures have curbed the spread of COVID-19, but waste generation and movement limitations have had an unintended impact on the environment over the past 3 years (2020–2022). Many studies have summarized the observed and potential environmental impacts associated with COVID-19, however, only a few have quantified and compared the effects of these unintended environmental impacts; moreover, whether COVID-19 policy stringency had the same effects on the main environmental topic (i.e., CO2 emissions) across the 3 years remains unclear. To answer these questions, we conducted a systematic review of the recent literature and analyzed the main findings. We found that the positive environmental effects of COVID-19 have received more attention than the negative ones (50.6 % versus 35.7 %), especially in emissions reduction (34 % of total literature). Medical waste (14.5 %) received the highest attention among the negative impacts. Although global emission reduction, especially in terms of CO2, has received significant attention, the positive impacts were temporary and only detected in 2020. Strict COVID-19 policies had a more profound and significant effect on CO2 emissions in the aviation sector than in the power and industry sectors. For example, compared with 2019, international aviation related CO2 emissions dropped by 59 %, 49 %, and 25 % in 2020, 2021, and 2022, respectively, while industry related ones dropped by only 3.16 % in 2020. According to our developed evaluation matrix, medical wastes and their associated effects, including the persistent pollution caused by antibiotic resistance genes, heavy metals and microplastics, are the main challenges post the pandemic, especially in China and India, which may counteract the temporary environmental benefits of COVID-19. Overall, the presented results demonstrate methods to quantify the environmental effects of COVID-19 and provide directions for policymakers to develop measures to address the associated environmental issues in the post-COVID-19 world. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances are classed as endocrine disrupting compounds but continue to be used in many products such as firefighting foams, flame retardants, utensil coatings, and waterproofing of food packaging. Perfluoroalkyl exposure aberrantly modulates lipid, metabolite, and bile acid levels, increasing susceptibility to onset and severity of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. To date, most studies in humans have focused on perfluoroalkyl-exposure effects in adults. In this study we aimed to show if perfluoroalkyls are present in the human fetal liver and if they have metabolic consequences for the human fetus. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, human fetal livers from elective termination of pregnancies at the Aberdeen Pregnancy Counselling Service, Aberdeen, UK, were analysed by both targeted (bile acids and perfluoroalkyl substances) and combined targeted and untargeted (lipids and polar metabolites) mass spectrometry based metabolomic analyses, as well as with RNA-Seq. Only fetuses from normally progressing pregnancies (determined at ultrasound scan before termination), terminated for non-medical reasons, from women older than 16 years, fluent in English, and between 11 and 21 weeks of gestation were collected. Women exhibiting considerable emotional distress or whose fetuses had anomalies identified at ultrasound scan were excluded. Stringent bioinformatic and statistical methods such as partial correlation network analysis, linear regression, and pathway analysis were applied to this data to investigate the association of perfluoroalkyl exposure with hepatic metabolic pathways. Findings: Fetuses included in this study were collected between Dec 2, 2004, and Oct 27, 2014. 78 fetuses were included in the study: all 78 fetuses were included in the metabolomics analysis (40 female and 38 male) and 57 fetuses were included in the RNA-Seq analysis (28 female and 29 male). Metabolites associated with perfluoroalkyl were identified in the fetal liver and these varied with gestational age. Conjugated bile acids were markedly positively associated with fetal age. 23 amino acids, fatty acids, and sugar derivatives in fetal livers were inversely associated with perfluoroalkyl exposure, and the bile acid glycolithocholic acid was markedly positively associated with all quantified perfluoroalkyl. Furthermore, 7α-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, a marker of bile acid synthesis rate, was strongly positively associated with perfluoroalkyl levels and was detectable as early as gestational week 12. Interpretation: Our study shows direct evidence for the in utero effects of perfluoroalkyl exposure on specific key hepatic products. Our results provide evidence that perfluoroalkyl exposure, with potential future consequences, manifests in the human fetus as early as the first trimester of gestation. Furthermore, the profiles of metabolic changes resemble those observed in perinatal perfluoroalkyl exposures. Such exposures are already linked with susceptibility, initiation, progression, and exacerbation of a wide range of metabolic diseases.

	abstract = {Objective: To investigate indications, surgical and functional outcomes of robotic or endoscopic facelift thyroid surgery (FTS) and whether FTS reported comparable outcomes of other surgical approaches. Data sources: PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Scopus. Review methods: A literature search was conducted about indications, clinical and surgical outcomes of patients who underwent FTS using PICOTS and PRISMA Statements. Outcomes reviewed included age; gender; indications; pathology; functional evaluations; surgical outcomes and complications. Results: Fifteen papers met our inclusion criteria, accounting for 394 patients. Endoscopic or robotic FTS was carried out for benign and malignant thyroid lesions, with or without central neck dissection. Nodule size and thyroid lobe volume did not exceed 6, 10 cm, respectively. FTS reported comparable outcome with transaxillary or oral approaches about operative time, complication rates or drainage features. The mean operative time ranged from 88 to 220 min, depending on the type of surgery (endoscopic vs robotic hemi- or total thyroidectomy). Conversion to open surgery was rare, occurring in 0–6.3% of cases. The most common complications were earlobe hypoesthesia, hematoma, seroma, transient hypocalcemia and transient recurrent nerve palsy. There was an important disparity between studies about the inclusion/exclusion criteria, surgical and functional outcomes. Conclusion: FTS is a safe and effective approach for thyroid benign and malignant lesions. FTS reports similar complications to conventional thyroidectomy and excellent cosmetic satisfaction.

	abstract = {Intestinal cell metabolism plays an important role in intestine health. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure could disorder intestinal cell metabolism. However, the mechanisms regarding how the three carbon sources interact under PFOA stress remined to be understood. The present study aimed to dissect the interconnections of glucose, glutamine, and fatty acids in PFOA-treated human colorectal cancer (DLD-1) cells using 13C metabolic flux analysis. The abundance of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites was decreased in PFOA-treated cells except for succinate, whereas most of amino acids were more abundant. Beside serine and glycine, the levels of metabolites derived from 13C glucose were reduced in PFOA-treated cells, and the pentose phosphate pathway flux was 1.4-fold higher in PFOA-treated cells than in the controls. In reductive glutamine pathway, higher labeled enrichment of citrate, malate, fumarate, and succinate was observed for PFOA-treated cells. The contribution of glucose to fatty acid synthesis in PFOA-treated cells decreased while the contribution of glutamine to fatty acid synthesis increased. Additionally, synthesis of TCA intermediates from fatty acid β-oxidation was promoted in PFOA-treated cells. All results suggested that metabolic remodeling could happen in intestinal cells exposed to PFOA, which was potentially related to PFOA toxicity relevant with the loss of glucose in biomass synthesis and energy metabolism. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Plastic products have become ubiquitous in society, and entered various ecosystems due to the massive scale of production. The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has listed microplastics (MPs), which form when plastic remnants degrade, as a global emerging pollutant, and the association between soil pollution and MPs has become a popular research topic. This paper systematically reviews research focusing on MP-related soil pollution from the past 10 years (2012−2022), with the identified papers demonstrating that interactions between MPs and soil aggregates has become a research frontier in the field. The presented research provides evidence that soil aggregates are important storage sites for MPs, and that storage patterns of MPs within soil aggregates are influenced by MP characteristics. In addition, MPs affect the formation, turnover, and stability of soil aggregates through the introduction of fracture points along with diverse physicochemical characteristics such as composition and specific surface area. The current knowledge base includes certain issues and challenges that could be addressed in future research by extending the spatial and temporal scales over which microplastic-soil aggregate interactions are studied, unifying quantitative and qualitative methods, and tracing the fates of MPs in the soil matrix. This review contributes to enriching our understanding of how terrestrial MPs interact with soil aggregates, and whether they pose a risk to soil health. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

With the increasing global population, the amounts of wastewater to be treated are expanding, along with the amounts of biosolids generated. The reuse of biosolids is now accepted for diversified applications in fields such as agriculture, engineering, agro-forestry. However, biosolids are known to be potential carriers of compounds that can be toxic to living beings or alter the environment. Therefore, biosolid reuse is subject to regulations, mandatory analyses are performed on heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants or pathogens. Conventional methods for the analysis of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants are demanding, lengthy, and sometimes unsafe. Here, we propose mass spectrometry imaging as a faster and safer method using small amounts of material to monitor heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in different types of biosolids, allowing for ecological and health risk assessment before reuse.

	abstract = {Objective: To identify, qualify and synthesize all studies that assessed if low serum level of 25(OH)D (<50 nmol/L) is associated with dental developmental defects (DDD) in primary teeth. Materials and methods: Observational studies or clinical trials were included if measured 25(OH)D serum levels in pregnant women and/or in their children (up to 3 years old) and evaluated the occurrence of DDD in the primary dentition of offspring associated with the low 25(OH)D levels. Literature reviews, case reports, laboratory and/or animals’ studies, conference abstracts, letters to the editor, book chapters and clinical protocols were excluded. Searches were carried out in 6 electronic databases and in the gray literature until March 2023, without restrictions. The study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the certainty of the evidence by GRADE. Data were descriptively synthesized considering the association between DDD and 25(OH)D levels. Results: Seven studies were included. Only developmental enamel defects (DED) were observed after examination of 6651 children. The incidence of DED ranged from 8.9% to 66%. Six studies found no association between low levels of 25(OH)D and DED. However, one reported correlation between hypomineralization of the primary second molar (HSMD) and low levels of 25(OH)D at birth. Methodological flaws were observed in all studies and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Conclusion: Although HSMD was the only DDD associated with low levels of 25(OH)D in children, the available evidence is still not conclusive. More robust studies are needed to endorse the biological plausibility of DDD in primary teeth due to low serum levels of 25(OH)D in pregnant women or in their children.

	abstract = {Background: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the status of Human Biomonitoring (HBM) in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region and provide recommendations for future research, considering the increased environmental contaminants that pose a threat to human health in this rapidly industrializing area. Methods: A thorough search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science databases up to February 2023 to identify biomonitoring studies on human exposure and levels in the GCC region. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility, conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The NIH Quality Assessment Tools and PRISMA guidelines were utilized for quality evaluation and reporting of results. Results: A total of 38 eligible articles were included in this systematic review out of 662 articles screened. The majority of the publications were from Saudi Arabia (n = 24) and Kuwait (n = 10), while limited representation was found from Qatar (n = 3) and the UAE (n = 1). No articles were identified from Oman and Bahrain. The studies focused on metals, organohalogen compounds, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and phthalates. The findings revealed elevated levels of metals and established correlations between metal exposure and adverse health effects, including infant neurodevelopmental issues, vitamin D deficiency, and oxidative stress. The presence of organohalogen compounds and pesticides was prevalent in the GCC region, with significant associations between exposure to these compounds and negative health outcomes. Notably, high levels of perchlorate were observed in the Kuwaiti population, and a study from Saudi Arabia found an association between per- and polyfluorinated substances and increased odds of osteoporosis. Conclusions: This review emphasizes the need to address environmental health challenges in the GCC region through improved HBM research methods and strategies. Implementing biomonitoring programs, conducting cohort studies, investing in tools and expertise, promoting collaboration, and engaging the community are crucial for reliable HBM data in the GCC. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) can disrupt liver homeostasis. Studies have shown that a single exposure to PFAS may provoke abnormal liver function; however, few studies have investigated the overall effect of PFAS mixtures. We aimed to investigate associations between exposure to PFAS mixtures and liver function indices and explore the relevant mechanisms. This study included 278 adult males from Guangzhou, China. Serum metabolite profiles were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. We applied weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression as well as Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to analyze the association of nine PFAS mixtures with 14 liver function indices. PFAS mixtures were positively associated with apolipoprotein B (APOB) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and negatively associated with direct bilirubin (DBIL) and total bilirubin (TBIL) in both the WQS and BKMR analyses. In addition, Spearman's correlation test showed individual PFAS correlated with APOB, GGT, TBIL, and DBIL, while there's little correlation between individual PFAS and other liver function indices. In linear regression analysis, PFHxS, PFOS, PFHpS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUdA were associated with APOB; PFOA, PFDA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFUdA were associated with GGT. Subsequently, a metabolome-wide association study and mediation analysis were combined to explore metabolites that mediate these associations. The mechanisms linking PFAS to APOB and GGT are mainly related with amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. High-dimensional mediation analysis showed that glycerophospholipids are the main markers of the association between PFAS and APOB, and that (R)-dihydromaleimide, Ile Leu, (R)-(+)-2-pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, and L-glutamate are the main markers of the association between PFAS and GGT. In summary, overall associations between PFAS and specific indices of liver function were found using two statistical methods; the metabolic pathways and markers identified here may serve to prompt more detailed study in animal-based systems, as well as a similar detailed analysis in other populations. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Pentachlorophenol (PCP) is a ubiquitous environmental toxicant with various adverse effects. Although its neurotoxicity has been reported, the underlying mechanism and subsequent detoxification remain unclear. In this study, embryos and adult zebrafish were exposed to PCP to determine its potential neurotoxic mechanism and protective indicators. The survival rate, heart rate, mobility time, active status and moving distance were significantly decreased in larvae after 30 μg/L PCP exposure. Likewise, the mobile time, latency to the first movement, velocity and moving distance of adult zebrafish were significantly reduced by PCP exposure. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of larvae revealed that arginine and proline metabolism was the primary pathway affected by PCP exposure, reflected by increased proline and decreased citrulline (CIT) contents, which were confirmed by quantitative data. PCP exposure suppressed the conversion from arginine to CIT in larvae by downregulating the expression of nos1 and nos2a. Ornithine content was increased in the brains and intestines of adult zebrafish after PCP exposure, which inhibited ornithine catabolism to CIT by downregulating otc, resulting in reduced CIT. Intriguingly, CIT supplementation significantly restored the neurobehavioral defects induced by PCP in larvae and adult zebrafish. CIT supplementation upregulated the expression of ef1α and tuba1 in larvae and inhibited the downregulation of ef1α in the brains of adult zebrafish. Taken together, these results indicated that CIT supplementation could protect against PCP-induced neurotoxicity by upregulating the expression of genes involved in neuronal development and function. © 2023},

Body burdens of Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) were measured and the possible sources of toxicants discussed. In addition, a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) based untargeted metabolomics analysis was performed using the mantle tissues of mussels. Correlations between the results of contaminant body burdens and metabolic variations were investigated. The results demonstrated that high accumulations of low-molecular-weight PAHs were found in mussels. High body burdens of PCBs and OCPs were only found at mussels from the site close to the river mouth. Some of the metabolic pathways were correlated with the accumulation of PAHs. No correlations were found between PCB and OCP accumulations and metabolic abundances.

	abstract = {Donor human milk (DHM) from a milk bank is the recommended feeding method for preterm infants when the mother's own milk (MOM) is not available. Despite this recommendation, information on the possible contamination of donor human milk and its impact on infant health outcomes is poorly characterised. The aim of this systematic review is to assess contaminants present in DHM samples that preterm and critically ill infants consume. The data sources used include PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL and Web of Science. A search of the data sources targeting DHM and its potential contaminants yielded 426 publications. Two reviewers (S. T. and D. L.) conducted title/abstract screening through Covidence software, and predetermined inclusion/exclusion criteria yielded 26 manuscripts. Contaminant types (bacterial, chemical, fungal, viral) and study details (e.g., type of bacteria identified, study setting) were extracted from each included study during full-text review. Primary contaminants in donor human milk included bacterial species and environmental pollutants. We found that bacterial contaminants were identified in 100% of the papers in which bacterial contamination was sought (16 papers) and 61.5% of the full data set (26 papers), with the most frequently identified genera being Staphylococcus (e.g., Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus) and Bacillus (e.g., Bacillus cereus). Chemical pollutants were discovered in 100% of the papers in which chemical contamination was sought (eight papers) and 30.8% of the full data set (26 papers). The most frequently identified chemical pollutants included perfluoroalkyl substances (six papers), toxic metal (one paper) and caffeine (one paper). Viral and fungal contamination were identified in one paper each. Our results highlight the importance of establishing standardisation in assessing DHM contamination and future studies are needed to clarify the impact of DHM contaminants on health outcomes. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Organochalcogen compounds are prevalent in numerous natural products, pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, polymers, biological molecules and synthetic intermediates. Direct chalcogenation of C-H bonds has evolved as a step- and atom-economical method for the synthesis of chalcogen-bearing compounds. Nevertheless, direct C-H chalcogenation severely lags behind C-C, C-N and C-O bond formations. Moreover, compared with the C-H monochalcogenation, reports of selective mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive dichalcogenation of C-H bonds are relatively scarce. The past decade has witnessed significant advancements in selective mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive dichalcogenation of various C(sp2)-H and C(sp3)-H bonds via transition-metal-catalyzed/mediated, photocatalytic, electrochemical or metal-free approaches. In light of the significance of both mono- and dichalcogen-containing compounds in various fields of chemical science and the critical issue of chemoselectivity in organic synthesis, the present review systematically summarizes the advances in these research fields, with a special focus on elucidating scopes and mechanistic aspects. Moreover, the synthetic limitations, applications of some of these processes, the current challenges and our own perspectives on these highly active research fields are also discussed. Based on the substrate types and C-H bonds being chalcogenated, the present review is organized into four sections: (1) transition-metal-catalyzed/mediated chelation-assisted selective C-H mono-/dichalcogenation or exclusive dichalcogenation of (hetero)arenes; (2) directing group-free selective C-H mono-/dichalcogenation or exclusive dichalcogenation of electron-rich (hetero)arenes; (3) C(sp3)-H dichalcogenation; (4) dichalcogenation of both C(sp2)-H and C(sp3)-H bonds.

	abstract = {Given that antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) become emerging pollutants, their accumulation and transfer caused by extensive use of antibiotic and non-antibiotic drugs raise concerns. In contrast, the impacts of non-antibiotic drugs have been largely overlooked, and their regulation mechanism in anammox system remains unclear. In this study, the single and combined effects of typical antibiotic (doxycycline) and non-antibiotic drug (propranolol) on anammox consortia were evaluated and compared from process performance, community succession, metabolic and gene regulation perspectives. Significant reduction in the nitrogen removal efficiency (49.0 ± 0.5%) was only observed in the anammox process stressed by propranolol and doxycycline, but it was reversible. Metabolome results showed that anammox consortia upregulated amino acid metabolism under propranolol stress, while the abundance of pyrimidine and purine metabolic pathways significantly increased under doxycycline and multidrug stress. Microorganisms adapted to these stresses by changing the utilization preference for metabolites. Metagenomic analyses indicated that doxycycline and propranolol induced the high frequency of gene transfer through increasing oxidative stress level, membrane permeability, pili and efflux pumps. Significant correlations between ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), especially intI1, demonstrated the conjugative transfer of ARGs. Furthermore, structural equation models showed that microbial community, bacterial metabolism, MGEs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and corresponding SOS response were key driving factors for ARGs transfer in the anammox systems. These findings fill the gap in the effect of non-antibiotic drugs on anammox system and their regulation mechanism, which further provides a theoretical guidance for anammox-based process to treat multidrug-containing wastewater. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Micro/nanoplastics (M/NPs) and phthalates (PAEs) are emerging pollutants. Polystyrene (PS) MPs and dibutyl phthalate (DBP) are typical MPs and PAEs in the environment. However, how dandelion plants respond to the combined contamination of MPs and PAEs remains unclear. In this study, we evaluated the individual and combined effects of PS NPs (10 mg L−1) and DBP (50 mg L−1) on dandelion (Taraxacum officinale) seedlings. The results showed that compared to control and individual-treated plants, coexposure to PS NPs and DBP significantly affected plant growth, induced oxidative stress, and altered enzymatic and nonenzymatic antioxidant levels of dandelion. Similarly, photosynthetic attributes and chlorophyll fluorescence kinetic parameters were significantly affected by coexposure. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) results showed that PS particles had accumulated in the root cortex of the dandelion. Metabolic analysis of dandelion showed that single and combined exposures caused the plant's metabolic pathways to be profoundly reprogrammed. As a consequence, the synthesis and energy metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and organic acids were affected because galactose metabolism, the citric acid cycle, and alanine, aspartic acid and glutamic acid metabolism pathways were significantly altered. These results provide a new perspective on the phytotoxicity and environmental risk assessment of MPs and PAEs in individual or coexposures. © 2023},

	abstract = {In Africa, the effects of informal e-waste recycling on the environment are escalating. It is regularly transported from developed to developing nations, where it is disassembled informally in search of precious metals, thus increasing human exposure to harmful compounds. Africa has a serious problem with e-waste, as there are significant facilities in Ghana and Nigeria where imported e-waste is unsafely dismantled. however, because they are in high demand and less expensive than new ones, old electronic and electrical items are imported in large quantities, just like in many developing nations. After that, these objects are frequently scavenged to recover important metals through heating, burning, incubation in acids, and other techniques. Serious health hazards are associated with these activities for workers and individuals close to recycling plants. At e-waste sites in Africa, there have been documented instances of elevated concentrations of hazardous elements, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy metals in dust, soils, and vegetation, including plants consumed as food. Individuals who handle and dispose of e-waste are exposed to highly hazardous chemical substances. This paper examines heavy metal risks around e-waste sites and comparable municipal dumpsites in major African cities. Elevated concentrations of these heavy metals metal in downstream aquatic and marine habitats have resulted in additional environmental impacts. These effects have been associated with unfavourable outcomes in marine ecosystems, such as reduced fish stocks characterized by smaller sizes, increased susceptibility to illness, and decreased population densities. The evidence from the examined studies shows how much e-waste affects human health and the environment in Africa. Sub-Saharan African nations require a regulatory framework that includes specialized laws, facilities, and procedures for the safe recycling and disposal of e-waste. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The rapid global expansion of industrialization has resulted in the discharge of a diverse range of hazardous contaminants into the ecosystem, leading to extensive environmental contamination and posing a pressing ecological concern. In this context, activated carbon (AC) has emerged as a highly promising adsorbent, offering significant advantages over conventional forms. For instance, AC has demonstrated remarkable adsorption capabilities, as evidenced by the successful removal of atrazine and ibuprofen using KOH and KOH–CO2-activated char, achieving impressive adsorption rates of 90% and 95%, respectively, at an initial dosage of 10 mg L-1. Moreover, AC can effectively adsorb aromatic compounds through π-π stacking interactions. The aromatic rings in organic molecules can align and interact with the carbon atoms in AC's structure, leading to effective adsorption. In this review, by employing a systematic analysis of recent research findings (majorly from 2015 to 2023), an in-depth exploration of AC's evolution and its wide-ranging applications in adsorbing and remediating emerging pollutants, including dyes, organic contaminants, and hazardous gases and mitigating the adverse impacts of such emerging pollutants on ecosystems have been discussed.

	abstract = {For decades, the Buriganga River in Dhaka, Bangladesh, has suffered from persistent pollution, leading to heavy metal contamination in fish samples that poses significant risks to human health. This study conducted an analysis of the whole bodies of various fish species, including Heteropnuestes fossilis, Channa punctatus, Notopterus notopterus Channa striata and Colisa fasciata to examine the concentrations of Chromium, Manganese, Nickel, Copper, Zinc, Arsenic, Cadmium, Barium, and Lead. The analysis was performed using inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, revealing notable concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cd, and Zn, with average levels of 6.85, 156.77, 0.41, and 3.37 mg/kg, respectively. Assessment of target hazard quotients for Pb, against recommended benchmark doses of observable effects, indicated levels 2 to 6 times higher than the recommended safety thresholds. The cumulative totals of target hazard quotients across multiple specimens exceeded 2 and, in some cases, reached up to 7, surpassing the safety cutoff of 1. The risk of cancer from Ni and Pb was calculated to be 1 in 10,000 on average for each, classifying it as a moderate risk. Quantitative analysis revealed that heavy metal concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cd, and Zn in most fish samples exceeded reference safety values. Simultaneously, hazard analysis identified critical concerns regarding Pb content in one sample, and cumulative toxin loads in almost every sample were deemed unsafe for regular consumption. In addition to quantitative assessments, a qualitative survey employed observation techniques, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews to investigate consumption behaviors and viewpoints on fish contamination. The results revealed that consumers generally held an enthusiastic attitude towards consuming these fish and were largely unaware of the associated health hazards. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Emerging pollutants (EPs) emerged as a group of new compounds whose presence in the environment has been widely detected in Mexico. In this country, different concentrations of pharmaceutical compounds, pesticides, dyes, and microplastics have been reported, which vary depending on the region and the analyzed matrix (i.e., wastewater, surface water, groundwater). The evidence of the EPs' presence focuses on the detection of them, but there is a gap in information regarding is biomonitoring and their effects in health in Mexico. The presence of these pollutants in the country associated with lack of proper regulations in the discharge and disposal of EPs. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive view of the current environmental status, policies, and frameworks regarding Mexico's situation. The review also highlights the lack of information about biomonitoring since EPs are present in water even after their treatment, leading to a critical situation, which is high exposure to humans and animals. Although, technologies to efficiently eliminate EPs are available, their application has been reported only at a laboratory scale thus far. Here, an overview of health and environmental impacts and a summary of the research works reported in Mexico from 2014 to 2023 were presented. This review concludes with a concrete point of view and perspective on the status of the EPs' research in Mexico as an alert for government entities about the necessity of measures to control the EPs disposal and treatment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {ACE2 as a functional receptor for SARS coronavirus plays an important role in COVID-19 infection of the host. Thus, we aimed to explore interaction networks between ACE2 and common host factors in COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity. We identified 1,191 protein targets closely related to ACE2, and integrated the GEO database and multiple public databases to identify 305 host factors related to ACE2 between COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity. Further enrichment analyses showed that metabolic processes, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation and PPAR signaling pathways had vital significance in the comorbidity of asthma and COIVD-19. HRAS, IFNG, CAT, CDH1, FASN, ACLY, CCL5, VCAM1, SCD and HMGCR were the key host factors related to ACE2. Tissue-specific enrichment and correlation analysis with ACE2 showed that SCD, CAT and FASN were highly expressed in the lung; and these 10 molecules were closely related to ACE2 and specifically expressed in multiple tissues. We also identified a series of drugs, such as estradiol, tetrachlorodibenzodioxin, resveratrol, cyclosporine, perfluorooctanoic acid and so on. Finally, the expression levels and diagnostic performance of HRAS and SCD showed statistical significance in external databases. This study explored the interaction networks of ACE2-related host factors in COVID-19 and asthma and identified several potential drugs for COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity. Although our research needs further verification, it still informs the mechanisms and treatment of COVID-19/Asthma comorbidity. © 2023},

Despite of its therapeutic significance, the overall ratios and enantiomers have not been known. In this study, we analyzed the enantiomers of mitotane and o,p’-DDA in the plasma of patients by a newly developed chiral-phase method employed in two-dimensional chromatography. Important differences were observed in the ratio of (S)/(R)-mitotane, which varied substantially from 1:1.2 to 1:10 whereas the (S)/(R)-o,p’-DDA ratio was relatively conserved, at approximately 2:1. These findings provide evidence for the enantioselective metabolism and provide a method for further analyses of mitotane and metabolites, which can explain the variation in the therapeutic response. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Perfluorobutane sulfonates (PFBS) have garnered extensive utilization because of their distinctive physicochemical properties. The liver acts as a key target organ for toxicity within the body and is vital for regulating metabolic processes, particularly lipid metabolism. However, there is currently a significant research gap regarding the influences of PFBS on hepatic lipid metabolism, especially in individuals with different dietary statuses. Here, the objective of this research was to examine the effects of PFBS on hepatic function under different dietary conditions. The results suggested that the levels of liver injury biomarkers were significantly upregulated, e.g., transaminase (GPT, GOT), while liver lipid levels were downregulated after exposure to PFBS at concentration of 50 μg/L for 42 days. Moreover, restricted diet further intensified the adverse effects of PFBS on the liver. Metabolomics analysis identified significant alterations in lipid-related metabolites in PFBS-induced hepatotoxicity, PFBS exposure induced a decrease in lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcholine. PFBS exposure caused an increase in aldosterone and prostaglandin f2alpha under restricted diet. In PFBS treatment group, histidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis were the main pathway for PFBS toxicity. Aldosterone-regulated sodium reabsorption as a vital factor in inducing PFBS toxicity in the RD-PFBS treatment group. The analysis of 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that exposure to PFBS resulted in imbalance of gut microbial communities. PFBS exposure induced a decrease in Akkermansia and Lactobacillus, but an increase in Enterococcus. PFBS exposure caused the abundance of Lachnospiraceae_NK4A136_group was significantly elevated under restricted diet. Additionally, disruptions in the expression of genes involved in lipid production and consumption may significantly contribute to lipid imbalance in the liver. This study underscores the importance of recognizing the harmful impact of PFBS on liver function, along with the biotoxicity of contaminant influenced by dietary habits. © 2023},

	abstract = {Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are intentionally produced persistent organic pollutants (POPs) that are resistant to environmental degradation. Previous in-vitro and in-vivo studies have shown that POPs can induce oxidative stress, which is linked to neurodegenerative diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer. However, findings in epidemiological studies are inconsistent and an evidence synthesis study is lacking to summarize the existing literature and explore research gaps. Objective: We evaluated the effects of PFAS, PCBs, OCPs, and PBDEs, on oxidative stress biomarkers in epidemiological studies. Methods: A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane CENTRAL to identify all published studies related to POPs and oxidative stress up to December 7th, 2022. We included human observational studies reporting at least one exposure to POPs and an oxidative stress biomarker of interest. Random-effects meta-analyses on standardized regression coefficients and effect direction plots with one-tailed sign tests were used for quantitative synthesis. Results: We identified 33 studies on OCPs, 35 on PCBs, 49 on PFAS, and 12 on PBDEs. Meta-analyses revealed significant positive associations of α-HCH with protein carbonyls (0.035 [0.017, 0.054]) and of 4′4-DDE with malondialdehyde (0.121 [0.056, 0.187]), as well as a significant negative association between 2′4-DDE and total antioxidant capacity (TAC) (-0.042 [-0.079, -0.004]), all β [95%CI]. Sign tests showed a significant positive association between PCBs and malondialdehyde (pone-tailed = 0.03). Additionally, we found significant negative associations of OCPs with acetylcholine esterase (pone-tailed = 0.02) and paraoxonase-1 (pone-tailed = 0.03). However, there were inconsistent associations of OCPs with superoxide dismutase, glutathione peroxidase, and catalase. Conclusions: Higher levels of OCPs were associated with increased levels of oxidative stress through increased pro-oxidant biomarkers involving protein oxidation, DNA damage, and lipid peroxidation, as well as decreased TAC. These findings have the potential to reveal the underlying mechanisms of POPs toxicity. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Emerging contaminants have been increasingly recognized as critical determinants in global public health outcomes. However, the intricate relationship between these contaminants and glucose metabolism remains to be fully elucidated. The paucity of comprehensive clinical data, coupled with the need for in-depth mechanistic investigations, underscores the urgency to decipher the precise molecular and cellular pathways through which these contaminants potentially mediate the initiation and progression of diabetes mellitus. A profound understanding of the epidemiological impact of these emerging contaminants, as well as the elucidation of the underlying mechanistic pathways, is indispensable for the formulation of evidence-based policy and preventive interventions. This review systematically aggregates contemporary findings from epidemiological investigations and delves into the mechanistic correlates that tether exposure to emerging contaminants, including endocrine disruptors, perfluorinated compounds, microplastics, and antibiotics, to glycemic dysregulation. A nuanced exploration is undertaken focusing on potential dietary sources and the consequential role of the gut microbiome in their toxic effects. This review endeavors to provide a foundational reference for future investigations into the complex interplay between emerging contaminants and diabetes mellitus. © 2024 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Species feeding lower at the food web like cyprinids (carp) are often advocated for sustainable aquaculture. However, their gastrointestinal biology (lack of stomach) has limited their acid-peptic digestion, acid lysis of plants and invertebrate tissues, and phosphorus uptake. This review presents data from 118 articles on the use of plant-based feed additives (PFAs) in Cyprinus carpio (common carp). Our review shows that most PFA research in carp is focused on improving feed and nutrient utilization efficiency along various levels (in vivo digestibility, metabolizability to in situ nutrient loading), while other half is focused on ensuring animal welfare standards (biomass, immunity, welfare). Several reviewed plant-based additives however tend to do both. The PFAs include essential oils (EOs), plant-part extracts (PPEs), medicinal plants (herbs) and spices. The effective inclusion rate of EOs is lower (0.5%–0.75%). Whereas PPEs, herbs and spices work at a generic inclusion rate of 2%–5% in carp feeds. Even at an optimum inclusion rate, there are factors controlling PFAs efficacy such as methods of preparation (reviewed). PFAs like lemon beebrush, geranium, dill, Rosemary pepper and common mallow with/without certain pre-conditions are better to avoid in cyprinid diets. Although certain PFAs may potentially alter organoleptic qualities of carp flesh or might assist in training carp immunity, information on these aspects is limited. The review also provides a quick guide to researchers and feed companies interested in exploring the potential of PFAs in C. carpio aquaculture. Potential PFAs that could be valuable for cyprinids, but not yet explored are also listed. © 2023 The Authors. Reviews in Aquaculture published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd.},

	abstract = {Arsenic, a metalloid that exists by nature, reaches the earth either by natural or anthropogenic events and is considered an emerging pollutant. The existence of arsenic in soil systems is a fate to the environment since it is mobile and being transported to other systems because of its bioavailability and speciation process. Arsenic transformation in the soil and its thorough understanding of how it enters plant systems are crucial. Notably, transporters are responsible for most of the arsenic that enters the plant system. Consumption of crops or animals and drinking water polluted with arsenic are the prime factors in transmitting arsenic to people. Severe adverse effects on humans arise as an outcome of long-term contact with arsenic-rich foodstuff and water. An effort has been made to outline the several sources and their dynamics in the surroundings and health impact on humans in this review. In addition, various strategies have been practiced to remove arsenic in the soil and water systems is also addressed.

	abstract = {Background: Knowledge surrounding the association between exposure to pesticides and hypothyroidism is inconsistent and controversial. Methods: The aim of present study was, therefore, to review scientific evidence systematically and conduct a meta-analysis into the contribution of exposure to pesticides to hypothyroidism. PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar were searched. The findings are presented as OR, HR, PR, IRR, and 95% confidence interval (95%CI). A fixed-effect model using the inverse-variance method and random-effects inverse-variance model with DerSimonian-Laird method were used for estimating the pooled estimates. Cochran Q and I2 tests were used to confirm the heterogeneity of selected studies. Results: Twelve studies were included in the systematic review, and 9 studies in the meta-analysis. Epidemiological evidence suggested that exposure to insecticides including organochlorines, organophosphates, and pyrethroids increased risk of hypothyroidism (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 1.23, 95%CI = 1.14, 1.33 for organochlorines, aOR = 1.12, 95%CI = 1.07, 1.17 for organophosphates, aOR = 1.15, 95%CI = 1.03, 1.28 for pyrethroids). Exposure to herbicides also increased risk of hypothyroidism (aOR = 1.06, 95%CI = 1.02, 1.10). However, exposure to fungicides and fumigants was not found to be associated with hypothyroidism. Conclusion: To increase current knowledge and confirm evidence to date future research needs to center on large-scale longitudinal epidemiological and biological studies, examination of dose–response relationships, the controlling of relevant confounding variables, using standardized and high sensitivity tools, and investigating the effects of environmental exposure. © 2023, BioMed Central Ltd., part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Microplastics, as emerging pollutants, have become a global environmental concern. Blue carbon ecosystems (BCEs) are threatened by microplastics. Although substantial studies have explored the dynamics and threats of microplastics in BCEs, the fate and driving factors of microplastics in BCEs on a global scale remain largely unknown. Here, the occurrence, driving factors, and risks of microplastics in global BCEs were investigated by synthesizing a global meta-analysis. The results showed that the abundance of microplastics in BCEs has notable spatial differences worldwide, with the highest microplastic concentrations in Asia, especially in South and Southeast Asia. Microplastic abundance is influenced by the vegetation habitat, climate, coastal environment, and river runoff. The interaction of geographic location, ecosystem type, coastal environment, and climate enhanced the effects of microplastic distribution. In addition, we found that microplastic accumulation in organisms varied according to feeding habits and body weight. Significant accumulation was observed in large fish; however, growth dilution effects were also observed. The effect of microplastics on the organic carbon content of sediments from BCEs varies by ecosystem; microplastic concentrations do not necessarily increase organic carbon sequestration. Global BCEs are at a high risk of microplastic pollution, with high microplastic abundance and toxicity driving the high pollution risk. Finally, this review provides scientific evidence that will form the basis for future microplastic research, focusing on the transport of microplastics in BCEs; effects on the growth, development, and primary productivity of blue carbon plants; and soil biogeochemical cycles. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) contamination is ubiquitous and comprises a significant worldwide concern in ecological and Public Health frameworks. Many aquatic biota representatives have been reported as contaminated by these toxic compounds, including one of the most threatened vertebrate groups, elasmobranchs (sharks and rays). Although elasmobranchs play important ecological roles and provide significant ecosystem services, they are highly consumed and comprise a cheap source of protein for humans globally. Studies concerning elasmobranch PAH contamination are, however, notably lacking. A systematic review was, thus, conducted herein to assess PAH elasmobranch contamination and discuss potential human health risks following the Preferred Reporting Item Statement Guidelines for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines applying the Population (P), Intervention (I), Comparison I, and Outcome (O) (PICO) strategy. A total of 86 published papers were retrieved by this method and analyzed. Only nine studies of this total concerned PAH elasmobranch contamination, assessed in 10 shark species and one ray species, with only one study calculating human health risks. A significant knowledge gap is, thus, noted for this subject, indicating the need to monitor PAH elasmobranch contamination in consumed shark and ray species worldwide. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Sulfonamide antibiotics (SAs) are ubiquitous in surface water and soil environments, raising considerable concerns about their risk and removal. However, the impacts of various bromide ion (Br−) concentrations on the phytotoxicity, uptake and fate of SAs in plant growth and physiological metabolism of plants have not been well understood. Our research demonstrated that low concentrations of Br− (0.1, 0.5 mM) promoted the uptake and degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) in wheat and attenuated the phytotoxicity of SDZ. Additionally, we proposed a degradation pathway and identified the brominated product of SDZ (SDZBr), which attenuated the dihydrofolate synthesis inhibition by SDZ. The primary mechanism was that Br− reduced the level of reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) and alleviated oxidative damage. The production of SDZBr and the high consumption of H2O2 suggest the potential generation of reactive bromine species, contributing to the degradation of the electron-rich SDZ and thus reducing its toxicity. Moreover, metabolome analysis of wheat roots indicated that low concentrations of Br− stimulated the production of indoleacetic acid under SDZ stress, promoting growth and enhancing the uptake and degradation of SDZ. Conversely, high Br− (1 mM) concentration produced a deleterious effect. These findings provide valuable insights into the mechanisms of antibiotic removal, suggesting a potentially novel approach to plant-based antibiotic remediation. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Low-income countries are struggling with the health impacts of both surface and groundwater chemical contamination. Although the impact of biological contaminants on children's health is acknowledged, the long-term effects of these and emerging contaminants on young children may be underestimated. To map the existing evidence on health impacts of water contaminated with chemicals on young children (<5 years), we conducted a scoping review to select and organize relevant literature. Of the 98 studies in the review, 24 revealed that the hazard ratio of arsenic, nitrates, cadmium, and fluoride (all of which are on the World Health Organisation's list of 10 chemicals of public health concern) was higher in very young children than in older age groups. Anthropogenic activities (textile manufacturing, waste disposal, and intensified agriculture) are leading contributors to the release of chemicals to groundwater used for drinking. Three major pathways for chemical contamination exposure in young children were confirmed: maternal transmission during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and early school years. Children exhibited acute and chronic disruptions to their neurological, skeletal, reproductive, and endocrine systems, as well as cumulative carcinogenic risks, amongst other life-altering consequences. The lack of research on emerging contaminants' effects on young children in low-income countries is worrisome, as their increased use may compound the issues caused by the existing problem of “legacy chemicals.” Precautionary principle should regulate the operation of industries producing these chemicals in a robust manner. Evidence from major producers and exporters in high-income countries is sufficient to warrant action, even without waiting for direct harm to be observed in low-income countries. Literature recommends prioritising prevention of contamination over demand side treatment or finding alternative water sources, especially in water-scarce areas affected by climate change. Local and transnational efforts are required to enforce safer industry practices and prevent further water quality deterioration in low-income countries. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is widely used in aviation science and technology, transportation, electronics, kitchenware, and other household products. It is stable in the environment and has potential nephrotoxicity. To investigate the effect of PFOA exposure during pregnancy on the kidneys of offspring mice, a total of 20 mice at day 0 of gestation were randomly divided into two groups (10 mice in each group), and each group was administered 0.2 mL of PFOA at a dose of 3.5 mg/kg or deionized water by gavage during gestation. The kidney weight, kidney index, histopathological observation, serum biochemistry, transcriptomics, and metabolomics of the kidneys of the 35-day offspring mice were analyzed. In addition, malondialdehyde (MDA), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and catalase (CAT) levels in the kidney were measured. Transcriptome analysis results showed that 387 genes were up-regulated and 283 genes were down-regulated compared with the control group. These differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were mainly concentrated in the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway and circadian rhythm. Compared with the control group, 64 and 73 metabolites were up- and down-regulated, respectively, in the PFOA group. The altered metabolites were mainly enriched in the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. PFOA can affect the expression levels of circadian rhythm-related genes in the kidneys of offspring mice, and this change is influenced by the PPAR signaling pathway. PFOA causes oxidative stress in the kidneys, which is responsible for significant changes in metabolites associated with the biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The comet assay is a sensitive method for the evaluation of DNA damages and DNA repair capacity at single-cell level. Allium cepa is a well-established plant model for toxicological studies. The aim of this scoping review was to investigate the recent application of the comet assay in Allium cepa root cells to assess the genotoxicity. To explore the literature a search was performed selecting articles published between January 2015 and February 2023 from Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases using the combined search terms “Comet assay” and “Allium cepa”. All the original articles that applied the comet assay to Allium cepa root cells were included. Of the 334 records initially found, 79 articles were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Some studies reported results for two or more toxicants. In these cases, the data for each toxicant were treated separately. Thus, the number of analyzed toxicants (such as chemicals, new materials, and environmental matrices) was higher than the number of selected papers and reached 90. The current use of the Allium-comet assay seems to be directed towards two types of approach: the direct study of the genotoxicity of compounds, mainly biocides (20% of analyzed compounds) and nano- and microparticles (17%), and assessing a treatment's ability to reduce or eliminate genotoxicity of known genotoxicants (19%). Although the genotoxicity identified by the Allium-comet assay is only one piece of a larger puzzle, this method could be considered a useful tool for screening the genotoxic potential of compounds released into the environment. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Aromatic hydrocarbons are persistent pollutants in aquatic systems as endocrine disruptors, significantly impacting natural ecosystems and human health. Microbes perform as natural bioremediators to remove and regulate aromatic hydrocarbons in the marine ecosystem. The present study focuses upon the comparative diversity and abundance of various hydrocarbon-degrading enzymes and their pathways from deep sediments along the Gulf of Kathiawar Peninsula and Arabian Sea, India. The elucidation of large number of degradation pathways in the study area under the presence of a wide range of pollutants whose fate needs to be addressed. Sediment core samples were collected, and the whole microbiome was sequenced. Analysis of the predicted ORFs (open reading frames) against the AromaDeg database revealed 2946 aromatic hydrocarbon-degrading enzyme sequences. Statistical analysis portrayed that the Gulfs were more diverse in degradation pathways compared to the open sea, with the Gulf of Kutch being more prosperous and more diverse than the Gulf of Cambay. The vast majority of the annotated ORFs belonged to groups of dioxygenases that included catechol, gentisate, and benzene dioxygenases, along with Rieske (2Fe–2S) and vicinal oxygen chelate (VOC) family proteins. From the sampling sites, only 960 of the total predicted genes were given taxonomic annotations, which mention the presence of many under-explored marine microorganism-derived hydrocarbon degrading genes and pathways. Through the present study, we tried to unveil the array of catabolic pathways of aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and genes from a marine ecosystem that upholds economic and ecological significance in India. Thus, this study provides vast opportunities and strategies for microbial resource recovery in marine ecosystems, which can be investigated to explore aromatic hydrocarbon degradation and their potential mechanisms under various oxic or anoxic environments. Future studies should focus on aromatic hydrocarbon degradation by considering degradation pathways, biochemical analysis, enzymatic, metabolic, and genetic systems, and regulations. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Halogenated organic compounds (HOCs) pose a serious problem for the environment. Many are highly toxic and accumulate both in soil and in organisms. Their biological transformation takes place by dehalogenation, in which the halogen substituents are detached from the carbon in the organic compound by enzymes produced by microorganisms. This increases the compounds’ water solubility and bioavailability, reduces toxicity, and allows the resulting compound to become more susceptible to biodegradation. The microbial halogen cycle in soil is an important part of global dehalogenation processes. The aim of the study was to examine the potential of microbial communities inhabiting natural and anthropogenically modified environments to carry out the dehalogenation process. The potential of microorganisms was assessed by analyzing the metagenomes from a natural environment (forest soils) and from environments subjected to anthropopression (agricultural soil and sludge from wastewater treatment plants). Thirteen genes encoding enzymes with dehalogenase activity were identified in the metagenomes of both environments, among which, 2-haloacid dehalogenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase were the most abundant genes. Comparative analysis, based on comparing taxonomy, identified genes, total halogens content and content of DDT derivatives, demonstrated the ability of microorganisms to transform HOCs in both environments, indicating the presence of these compounds in the environment for a long period of time and the adaptive need to develop mechanisms for their detoxification. Metagenome analyses and comparative analyses indicate the genetic potential of microorganisms of both environments to carry out dehalogenation processes, including dehalogenation of anthropogenic HOCs. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As an emerging pollutant, the antibiotic tetracycline (TC) has been consistently detected in wastewater and activated sludge. Biodegradation represents a potentially crucial pathway to dissipate TC contamination. However, few efficient TC-degrading bacteria have been isolated and a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TC degradation is still lacking. In this study, a novel TC-degrading bacterium, designated as Sphingobacterium sp. WM1, was successfully isolated from activated sludge. Strain WM1 exhibited a remarkable performance in degrading 50 mg/L TC within 1 day under co-metabolic conditions. Genomic analysis of the strain WM1 unveiled the presence of three functional tetX genes. Unraveling the complex molecular mechanisms, transcriptome analysis highlighted the role of upregulated transmembrane transport and accelerated electron transport in facilitating TC degradation. Proteomics confirmed the up-regulation of proteins involved in cellular biosynthesis/metabolism and ribosomal processes. Crucially, the tetX gene-encoding protein showed a significant upregulation, indicating its role in TC degradation. Heterologous expression of the tetX gene resulted in TC dissipation from an initial 51.9 mg/L to 4.2 mg/L within 24 h. The degradation pathway encompassed TC hydroxylation, transforming into TP461 and subsequent metabolites, which effectively depleted TC's inhibitory activity. Notably, the tetX genes in strain WM1 showed limited potential for horizontal gene transfer. Collectively, strain WM1′s potent TC degradation capacity signals a promise for enhancing TC clean-up strategies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The contamination of surface waters in China with Per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFASs) has been extensively studied in recent decades, however, almost all studies have been conducted in small areas and/or limited samples, which are not representative of the nationwide contamination of surface water environments with PFASs. In this study, attempt was made to provide a comprehensive report about PFASs pollution in Chinese surface water based on the PRISMA. By analyzing 111 papers published between 2006 and 2022, we provide a systematic review of the pollution of PFASs in surface water environments in China. The results show that 26 PFASs contaminants were detected at least once in China's surface water environment and were mainly concentrated in the eastern part of China. Most surface water environments in China had mean PFASs concentrations below 100 ng/L. The most polluted place was the Xiaoqing River, where sampling results in 2020 showed PFASs concentrations as high as 25,429 ng/L, followed by the Tangxun Lake, the Xi River, the Daling River, the Majia River, the Baiyangdian Lake, the Liuxi River, the Jiaolai River, the Tuo River and the Zhimai River. The Xiaoqing River also has the highest concentration of the novel pollutant, with concentrations of HFPO-TA and HFPO-DA as high as 1039 ng/L and 164 ng/L. Based on the source analysis, fluoropolymer manufacturing plants are the main source of PFASs pollutants in surface water. The results of the base risk analysis using risk quotients value (RQ) method show that the RQ values of the Xiaoqing River, the surface water near Bohai Bay, the Majia River and the Tuo River PFOA are 36.9, 7.7, 3.6 and 2.1 respectively, which are high risk areas and require enhanced control. This study provides information on surface waters contaminated by PFASs nationwide, and the results can be used as a reference for the development of pollution control and management strategies for PFASs in surface waters in China. © 2023 The Authors},

This paper aims to systematically review the principles, applications, and limitations of wastewater hydroponics technology in the context of pollution and nutrient removal. Unlike constructed wetlands, wastewater hydroponics has been proven to be effective in removing pollutants through small-scale in situ restoration. For instance, the average removal of COD, total nitrogen (TN), total phosphorus (TP), copper (Cu), and zinc (Zn) was more than 70%, 60%, 80%, 64.2%, and 49.5%, respectively. However, HP technology still has the disadvantages of high energy consumption, complex control parameters, and low public acceptance of using wastewater for planting crops. Therefore, further research is needed to reduce system energy consumption. In addition, hybrid technologies, such as two-stage hydroponics that use aquatic plants (algae or aquatic floating weeds) to recycle pollutant-containing wastewater nutrients for hydroponics, should be further developed. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Patient harm due to unsafe healthcare is widespread, potentially devastating, and often preventable. Hoping to eliminate avoidable harms, the World Health Organization (WHO) published the Global Patient Safety Action Plan in July 2021. The UK's National Health Service relies on several measures, including ‘never events’, ‘serious incidents’, ‘patient safety events’ and coroners’ Prevention of Future Deaths reports (PFDs) to monitor healthcare quality and safety. We conducted a systematic narrative review of PubMed and medRxiv on 19 February 2023 to explore the strengths and limitations of coroners’ PFDs and whether they could be a safety tool to help meet the WHO's Global Patient Safety Action Plan. We identified 17 studies that investigated a range of PFDs, including preventable deaths involving medicines and an assessment during the COVID-19 pandemic. We found that PFDs offered important information that could support hospitals to improve patient safety and prevent deaths. However, inconsistent reporting, low response rates to PFDs, and difficulty in accessing, analysing and monitoring PFDs limited their use and adoption as a patient safety tool for hospitals. To fulfil the potential of PFDs, a national system is required that develops guidelines, sanctions failed responses and embeds technology to encourage the prevention of future deaths. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {The effects of environmental pollution are associated with higher rates of mortality, morbidity, and years of life lost. It is known that these produce alterations in the human body, including changes in body composition. Research has focused on the association between contaminants and BMI through cross-sectional studies. The objective of this study was to synthesize the evidence for the association of pollutants on different measures of body composition. The PECOS strategy was defined, in which “P": participants of any age, sex, or ethnicity, “E": a higher level of environmental pollution, “C": a lower level of environmental pollution, “O": body composition measurements and “S": longitudinal studies. Studies from the following databases were included: MEDLINE, EMBASE, SciELO, LILACS, Scopus, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, and gray literature from inception to January 2023.3069 studies were identified, 18 were included in the systematic review, and 13 in the meta-analysis. These studies included 8.563 people, 47 environmental contaminants, and 16 measures of body composition. The meta-analysis by subgroup found that the association between dioxins, furans, PCBs, and waist circumference was β = 1.0 (95% CI: 0.85 to 1.16; I2: 95%), and the sum of four skinfolds β = 1.02 (95% CI: 0.88 to 1.16; I2: 24%). The association between pesticides and waist circumference was β = 1.00 (95% CI: 0.68 to 1.32; I2: 98%), and the fat mass was β = 0.99 (95% CI: 0.17 to 1.81; I2: 94%). Pollutants, especially endocrine-disrupting chemicals, among which dioxins, furans, PCBs, and pesticides, are associated with changes in body composition, mainly with waist circumference and the sum of four skinfolds. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Meibomian gland dysfunction (MGD) is highly prevalent and is the leading cause of evaporative dry eye disease (DED). MGD is characterized by a reduction in meibum secretion and/or a change in meibum composition that results in the disruption of the tear film lipid layer and an increase in the tear film evaporation rate. Excessive evaporation causes tear film instability, desiccation, tear hyperosmolarity, inflammation, and apoptosis of ocular surface cells, resulting in a continuous cycle of DED. The primary treatment goal for DED associated with MGD is to restore the tear film lipid layer and decrease evaporation, thereby reducing ocular signs and symptoms. The management of MGD includes home care options (eyelid hygiene, warming eye masks, ocular lubricants) and office-based treatments (manual expression, microblepharoexfoliation, thermal pulsation, intense pulsed light, intraductal probing). Topical ophthalmic prescription medications attempt to alter various factors that may contribute to DED (e.g., inflammation, bacterial growth, inadequate tear production). In this review, clinical evidence regarding available treatments and emerging therapies from randomized studies in patients with DED associated with MGD is summarized. Although some treatment modalities have been evaluated specifically for DED patients with MGD, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy and safety in this patient population. Currently, there are no approved prescription pharmacologic treatments specifically indicated for DED associated with MGD, and those medications approved for the treatment of DED do not target the key driver of the disease (i.e., excessive evaporation). NOV03 (perfluorohexyloctane; under review with the US Food and Drug Administration) is the most advanced emerging therapy for DED associated with MGD and has demonstrated statistically significant improvements in both signs and symptoms in randomized controlled trials. Development of novel pharmacotherapies will improve therapeutic options and allow for a more individualized approach for patients with DED associated with MGD. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Ethnopharmacological relevance: Salix babylonica L. belongs to the genus Salix, family Salicaceae. It is traditionally used as an antipyretic, antirheumatic, antidiabetic and for the treatment of ulcers and parasite skin diseases. It also has a range of pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and antibacterial effects. However, there are no reports on the phytochemical profile and efficacy of its leaves extract to modulate dexamethasone induced pancreatic damage. Aim of the study: The present study was performed to annotate the phytoconstituents of Salix babylonica leaf extract and explore whether and how it could modulate dexamethasone-induced pancreatic damage and the role of oxidative stress and autophagy in mediating its protective effects. Materials and methods: Wistar rats were used for this study. Salix babylonica in two dose levels (100 and 200 mg/kg) or metformin (50 mg/kg) was given by oral gavage concurrently with dexamethasone which was injected SC in a dose of 10 mg/kg for 4 consecutive days. Results: LC-MS analysis furnished 84 secondary metabolites belonging to phenolic acids, salicinoids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, cyclohexanediol glycosides, and hydroxy fatty acids. S. babylonica at both dose levels and metformin decreased the elevated pancreatic beclin while elevated the decreased pancreatic P62/SQSTM1 content compared to dexamethasone. These effects were associated with improved histopathological changes, glycemic and lipid parameters indicating that there might be a connection between autophagy and dexamethasone-induced pancreatic damage. Given that the level of GSH was negatively correlated with the levels of beclin and positively correlated with P62/SQSTM1, while both MDA and NO levels were positively correlated with beclin and negatively correlated with P62/SQSTM1, it seems that dexamethasone induced autophagy may be attributed to dexamethasone induced pancreatic oxidative stress. Conclusion: Our results indicate that S. babylonica protects pancreatic tissues against dexamethasone-induced damage by decreasing oxidative stress and its associated autophagy.

	abstract = {The massive use of polyhexamethylene guanidine (PHMG), as a typical bactericidal agent, raised environmental concerns to the public. This work comprehensively revealed the hormesis effects of PHMG occurred in waste activated sludge (WAS) on the generation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during anaerobic fermentation. The low level of PHMG (100 mg/g TSS) significantly promoted the VFAs generation (1283 mg COD/L, compared with 337 mg COD/L in the control) via synchronously facilitating the solubilization, hydrolysis, and acidification steps but inhibiting methanogenesis. Metagenomic analysis showed that the functional anaerobe (i.e., Bacteroides, Macellibacteroide and Parabacteroide) and corresponding genetic expressions responsible for extracellular hydrolysis (i.e., clpP), membrane transport (i.e., ffh and gspF), intracellular substrates metabolism (i.e., ald and paaF) and VFAs biosynthesis (i.e., ACACA and FASN) were enhanced in the optimal presence of PHMG. Moreover, the anaerobic species could respond and adapt to low PHMG stimuli via quorum sensing (i.e., cqsA, rpfC and rpfG), and thus maintain the high microbial metabolic activities. However, they were unable to tolerate the toxicity of excessive PHMG, resulting in the extremely low VFAs production. This work enlightened the effects of emerging pollutants on WAS fermentation at the genetic levels, and provided guidance on the WAS treatment and resource recovery. © 2023},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of man-made chemicals that are persistent in the environment. They can be transferred across the placenta to fetuses and through human milk to infants. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that the benefits of breastfeeding infants almost always outweigh the potential risks of harm from environmental chemicals. However, there are few chemical-specific summaries of the potential harms of exposure to PFAS during the neonatal period through breastfeeding. This systematic review explores whether exposure to PFAS through breastfeeding is associated with adverse health outcomes among infants and children using evidence from human and animal studies. Systematic searches identified 4297 unique records from 7 databases. The review included 37 total articles, including 9 animal studies and 1 human study measuring the direct contribution of exposure of the infant or pup through milk for any health outcome. Animal studies provided evidence of associations between exposure to PFOA through breastfeeding and reduced early life body weight gain, mammary gland development, and thyroid hormone levels. They also provided limited evidence of associations between PFOS exposure through breastfeeding with reduced early life body weight gain and cellular changes in the hippocampus. The direct relevance of any of these outcomes to human health is uncertain, and it is possible that many adverse health effects of exposure through breastfeeding have not yet been studied. This review documents the current state of science and highlights the need for future research to guide clinicians making recommendations on infant feeding.  © 2023 Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Society of Toxicology.},

	abstract = {Accelerating evidence confirms the contribution of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to disease burden and disability across the lifespan. Given that policy makers raise the high cost of remediation and of substituting PFAS with safer alternatives in consumer products as barriers to confronting adverse health outcomes associated with PFAS exposure, it is important to document the costs of inaction even in the presence of uncertainty. We therefore quantified disease burdens and related economic costs due to legacy PFAS exposures in the US in 2018. We leveraged systematic reviews and used meta-analytic inputs whenever possible, identified previously published exposure–response relationships, and calculated PFOA- and PFOS-attributable increases in 13 conditions. These increments were then applied to census data to determine total annual PFOA- and PFOS-attributable cases of disease, from which we calculated economic costs due to medical care and lost productivity using previously published cost-of-illness data. We identified PFAS-attributable disease costs in the US of $5.52 billion across five primary disease endpoints shown to be associated with PFAS exposure in meta-analyses. This estimate represented the lower bound, with sensitivity analyses revealing as much as $62.6 billion in overall costs. While further work is needed to assess probability of causation and establish with greater certainty effects of the broader category of PFAS, the results confirm further that public health and policy interventions are still necessary to reduce exposure to PFOA and PFOS and their endocrine-disrupting effects. This study demonstrates the large potential economic implications of regulatory inaction. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Aims: Sick sinus syndrome (SSS) and atrial fibrillation (AF) frequently coexist and show a bidirectional relationship. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to decipher the precise relationship between SSS and AF, further exploring and comparing different therapy strategies on the occurrence or progression of AF in patients with SSS. Methods and results: A systematic literature search was conducted until November 2022. A total of 35 articles with 37,550 patients were included. Patients with SSS were associated with new-onset AF compared to those without SSS. Catheter ablation was associated with a lower risk of AF recurrence, AF progression, all-cause mortality, stroke and hospitalization of heart failure compared to pacemaker therapy. Regarding the different pacing strategies for SSS, VVI/VVIR has higher risk of new-onset AF than DDD/DDDR. No significant difference was found between AAI/AAIR and DDD/DDDR, as well as between DDD/DDDR and minimal ventricular pacing (MVP) for AF recurrence. AAI/AAIR was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality when compared to DDD/DDDR, but lower risk of cardiac death when compared to DDD/DDDR. Right atrial septum pacing was associated with a similar risk of new-onset AF or AF recurrence compared to right atrial appendage pacing. Conclusion: SSS is associated with a higher risk of AF. For patients with both SSS and AF, catheter ablation should be considered. This meta-analysis re-emphasizes that high percentage of ventricular pacing should be avoided in patients with SSS in order to decrease AF burden and mortality. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) such as dichlorodimethyltrichloroethane (DDT) are present and ubiquitous in the environment due to their resilient nature. DDT is a prevalent endocrine disruptor still found in detectable amounts in organisms and the environment even after its use was banned in the 1970s. Medline and Google Scholar were systematically searched to detect all relevant animal and human studies published in the last 20 years (January 2003 to February 2023) in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statement. In total, 38 studies were included for qualitative synthesis. This systematic search and review indicated that exposure to DDT is associated with female reproductive health issues, such as reduced fecundability; increased risk of preterm/premature deliveries; increased periods of gestation; alterations in the synthesis of crucial reproductive hormones (Progesterone and Oxytocin) through ion imbalances and changes in prostaglandin synthesis, myometrial and stromal hypertrophy, and edema; and variations in uterine contractions through increased uterine wet weight. There was also limited evidence indicating DDT as a carcinogen sufficient to instigate reproductive cancers. However, this review only takes into account the in vitro studies that have established a possible pathway to understand how DDT impacts female infertility and leads to reproductive cancers. Links between the pathways described in various studies have been developed in this review to produce a summarized picture of how one event might lead to another. Additionally, epidemiological studies that specifically targeted the exposure to DDT of females belonging to various ethnicities have been reviewed to develop an overall picture of prevailing female reproductive health concerns in different nations. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The Arctic and the Antarctic Continent correspond to two eco-regions with extreme climatic conditions. These regions are exposed to the presence of contaminants resulting from human activity (local and global), which, in turn, represent a challenge for life forms in these environments. Anthropogenic pollution by semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in polar ecosystems has been documented since the 1960s. Currently, various studies have shown the presence of SVOCs and their bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the polar regions with negative effects on biodiversity and the ecosystem. Although the production and use of these compounds has been regulated, their persistence continues to threaten biodiversity and the ecosystem. Here, we summarize the current literature regarding microbes and SVOCs in polar regions and pose that bioremediation by native microorganisms is a feasible strategy to mitigate the presence of SVOCs. Our systematic review revealed that microbial communities in polar environments represent a wide reservoir of biodiversity adapted to extreme conditions, found both in terrestrial and aquatic environments, freely or in association with vegetation. Microorganisms adapted to these environments have the potential for biodegradation of SVOCs through a variety of genes encoding enzymes with the capacity to metabolize SVOCs. We suggest that a comprehensive approach at the molecular and ecological level is required to mitigate SVOCs presence in these regions. This is especially patent when considering that SVOCs degrade at slow rates and possess the ability to accumulate in polar ecosystems. The implications of SVOC degradation are relevant for the preservation of polar ecosystems with consequences at a global level. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disrupting chemicals that may cause breast cancer. However, there lacks consistent research on the association between TCDD, PFAS exposure, and breast cancer. To this end, a meta-analysis was carried out in this review to explore the relationship between these two endocrine disruptors and breast cancer. Relevant literature was searched from 5 databases: Medline, Scopus, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled by fixed-effects and random-effects meta-analysis models. A total of 17 publications were finally included for quantitative evaluation. Meta-analysis showed that TCDD (OR = 1.00, 95% CI = 0.89–1.12, I 2 = 39.3%, P = 0.144), PFOA (OR = 1.07, 95% CI = 0.84–1.38, I 2 = 85.9%, P < 0.001), PFOS (OR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.95–1.08, I 2 = 65.7%, P < 0.001), PFNA (OR = 0.89, 95% CI = 0.67–1.19, I 2 = 74.4%, P < 0.001), and PFHxS (OR = 0.90, 95% CI = 0.72–1.13, I 2 = 74%, P < 0.001) were not significantly correlated with breast cancer. Internal exposure, however, showed a significant positive correlation between TCDD and BC (OR = 2.85, 95% CI = 1.23–6.59, I 2 = 0.0%, P = 0.882). No statistically significant association between TCDD, PFAS exposure, and breast cancer was observed in this meta-analysis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

In this article, the current scenario of viscera handling in forensic science laboratories in India is mentioned in detail with a step-by-step procedure. Tests for phosphine and various pesticides are performed in the stomach and small intestine. Drugs are extracted according to different procedures depending upon the affinity of the drug i.e., acidic, basic, or neutral. After that, Tests for drugs and other toxic substances are usually performed in blood, liver, spleen, and kidney. Blood usually comes in the third jar, and is tested for drugs, alcohol, and maybe for pesticides, phosphine and for any other suspected toxin. Viscera sample needs to be digested before the analysis of heavy metals. Any part of the viscera can be digested and tested for heavy metal. Usually, a mixture of all the viscera parts is digested and analysed. The techniques mentioned in this article are rigorously used in the chemistry and toxicology division in forensic laboratories in India. © 2023 Informatics Publishing Limited and The Society of Toxicology.

	abstract = {Rhizoremediation is a promising remediation technology for the removal of soil persistent organic pollutants (POPs), especially benzo[a]pyrene (BaP). However, our understanding of the associations among rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microorganisms, and POPs degradation in different plant growth stages is limited. We combined stable-isotope probing (SIP), high-throughput sequencing, and metabolomics to analyze changes in rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microbes, and BaP biodegradation in the early growth stages (tillering, jointing) and later stage (booting) of ryegrass. Microbial community structures differed significantly among growth stages. Metabolisms such as benzenoids and carboxylic acids tended to be enriched in the early growth stage, while lipids and organic heterocyclic compounds dominated in the later stage. From SIP, eight BaP-degrading microbes were identified, and most of which such as Ilumatobacter and Singulisphaera were first linked with BaP biodegradation. Notably, the relationship between the differential metabolites and BaP degradation efficiency further suggested that BaP-degrading microbes might metabolize BaP directly to produce benzenoid metabolites (3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene), or utilize benzenoids (phyllodulcin) to stimulate the co-metabolism of BaP in early growth stage; some lipids and organic acids, e.g. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, might provide nutrients for the degraders to promote BaP metabolism in later stage. Accordingly, we determined that certain rhizospheric metabolites might regulate the rhizospheric microbial communities at different growth stages, and shift the composition and diversity of BaP-degrading bacteria, thereby enhancing in situ BaP degradation. Our study sheds light on POPs rhizoremediation mechanisms in petroleum-contaminated soils. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {In recent years, exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) has posed an increasing threat to human health. EDCs are major risk factors in the occurrence and development of many diseases. Continuous DNA damage triggers severe pathogenic consequences, such as cancer. Beyond their effects on the endocrine system, EDCs genotoxicity is also worthy of attention, owing to the high accessibility and bioavailability of EDCs. This review investigates and summarizes nearly a decade of DNA damage studies on EDC exposure, including DNA damage mechanisms, detection methods, population marker analysis, and the application of dietary phytochemicals. The aims of this review are (1) to systematically summarize the genotoxic effects of environmental EDCs (2) to comprehensively summarize cutting-edge measurement methods, thus providing analytical solutions for studies on EDC exposure; and (3) to highlight critical data on the detoxification and repair effects of dietary phytochemicals. Dietary phytochemicals decrease genotoxicity by playing a major role in the detoxification system, and show potential therapeutic effects on human diseases caused by EDC exposure. This review may support research on environmental toxicology and alternative chemo-prevention for human EDC exposure. © 2023},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) consist of a range of manufactured fluorinated chemicals that are used in a variety of household and waterproofing products, industrial processes, and firefighting foams. In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about PFAS in the environment, since they are difficult to break down through natural processes, are highly persistent in humans, animals, soils and waters, and can travel long distances in surface and groundwater. This has created an increased need for PFAS analysis. Most PFAS monitoring currently takes place using field sampling and chromatographic analytical methods, which are laboratory-based and are very costly when used to monitor PFAS in the environment. Using a semi-systematic literature review approach, a comparative study is conducted in this article on the available analytical methods and sensor technologies that can be used to monitor and detect PFAS in the environment, including chromatographic, instrumentation analysis, and sensor-based methods. This study considered four critical factors for effective and efficient monitoring methods, which include the type of PFAS detected, removing background levels, determining detection limits, and identifying samples. In general, other analytical instruments are used in conjunction with chromatographic techniques for detecting both target and non-target analytes at a lower level of detection (LOD). It is shown that even though some sensor types have a low LOD, they are only useful for detecting targeted PFAS in water samples. However, sensors are an emerging technology that could be developed to enable low-cost, portable methods for the remote detection of PFAS species on-site. © 2023 by the authors.},

The quality of all the articles which met our inclusion criteria was assessed using Newcastle-Ottawa scaling; five eligible studies were included in our systematic review. The most studied POP in ischemic stroke was polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and they have shown a trend for association with ischemic stroke. The study also revealed that living near a source of POPs contamination constitutes a risk of exposure and an increased risk of ischemic stroke.

Lakes, as important sources of freshwater, also serve as potential natural reservoirs of ARGs. In this study, we analyzed the distribution and potential risks of resistance genes in five typical freshwater lakes on the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau. Our findings revealed that multidrug and MLS ARGs dominated in the studied lakes. Notably, while Lugu Lake exhibited higher abundance of ARGs, mobile genetic elements (MGEs), and metal resistance genes (MRGs), a greater resistome risk was observed in the eutrophic Xingyun Lake. The dissemination processes of ARGs and MRGs are primarily driven by microbial communities and the horizontal gene transfer via MGEs. Limnohabitans, Flavobacterium, and Acinetobacter were identified as key players in the dissemination of ARGs. Our study highlights the persistence of ARGs and provides valuable baseline data and risk assessment of ARGs in plateau freshwater lakes. © 2023 The Authors},

A systematic review that only include full-length randomized controlled studies (RCTs), reporting the effects of F6H8 in three databases, PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science, was performed according to the PRISMA statement. The search period was performed between June 1, 2023, and June 21, 2023. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to analyze the quality of the studies selected. A total of six RCTs were included in this systematic review. F6H8 tear substitutes treatment achieved a higher improvement than control group interventions in most of the reported variables. The mean differences between both groups were in favor of F6H8 and were as follow: eye dryness score (EDS) base on a visual analogue scale (VAS) of −6.12 ± 4.3 points, ocular surface disease index (OSDI) questionnaire score of −2.8 ± 2.3 points, lipid layer thickness (LLT) of 11.4 ± 10.4 μm, total corneal fluorescein staining (tCFS) of −0.8 ± 0.3 points and ocular treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) of −0.66 ± 1.7. Tear film break-up time (TBUT) was the only variable in favor of control group with a mean of −0.5 ± 0.4 s. Patient satisfaction after F6H8 tear substitutes treatment was high. Therefore, F6H8 tear substitutes improve dry eye symptoms and signs with a satisfactory tolerability and could be recommended in patients with DED. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {A growing body of evidence suggests that chemicals interfere with the age of onset of menarche. We conducted a review in order to demonstrate the relationship between several categories of chemicals and menarche. We searched for English language papers using the Medline/PubMed database until April 2023. The chemical factors found to affect menarche were prenatal and antenatal smoke, phthalates, phenols, organochlorines, perfluoroalkyls and polyfluoroalkyls, metals, air pollutants and polybrominated diphenyl ethers. Low or high exposure to each chemical compound could affect the age of menarche, leading to early or delayed menarche. Furthermore, the results show that intrauterine exposure may have a different impact from antenatal exposure. There is evidence that endocrine-disrupting chemicals affect the age of menarche, but more research needs to be conducted. © 2023 by the authors.},

The system consists of a polyurethane-coated aluminum rosette frame, 12-L Teflon-coated Niskin-X samplers, nonmetallic rope, and autofiring module that enables an automatic bottle firing. Using this system, seawater samples were collected in the Ulleung Basin, East Sea (Japan Sea), and the concentrations of dissolved trace metals (Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb) were analyzed. Comparisons of trace metal concentrations to those obtained from the normal sampling system and previous data showed that our clean seawater sampling system could be utilized without metal contamination. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Korea Institute of Ocean Science & Technology (KIOST) and the Korean Society of Oceanography (KSO) and Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS), or Fast Track Surgery, aims to minimise the physiological stress of surgery and optimise patient rehabilitation. However, data on surgical interventions in obstetrics and gynaecology are limited. The aim of the study was to analyse the use of elements of the ERAS programme in gynaecologic surgery clinics and to assess the benefits of this approach. Analytical processing was carried out on systematic reviews and meta-analyses, articles and scientific reports published before June 2023, found and available through the PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases. The data were obtained from relevant published studies, including changes in quality of life, postoperative pain, use of opioids or anaesthesia, postoperative nausea and vomiting, rate of readmission, cost of hospitalisation, and clinically significant increase in patient satisfaction. The ERAS programme is a multimodal and multidisciplinary programme aimed at optimising perioperative treatment and improving postoperative outcomes in operative gynaecology by minimising the patient’s stress response, promoting functional recovery and achieving rapid recovery, where the patient is in the field of view of a number of specialists. The presented publications demonstrate that this concept of FTS is a fundamentally new approach to the surgical treatment of gynaecological patients and covers all stages of perioperative therapy: preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative. Conclusions. The initial stage of the surgeon’s and anaesthetist’s acquaintance with the patient is very important, as communication and rational presentation of information using illustrative and video material helps the patient understand the disease, consciously choose the proposed method of treatment, reduces anxiety, increases the role of the surgical team in treatment and satisfaction with its outcome, reduces the risk of dissatisfaction from false expectations (duration of the perioperative period, pain, changes in nutrition and mobility, sutures, etc.). The introduction of evidence-based medicine into the practice of operative gynaecology restructures classical approaches and principles of patient treatment, raises awareness of doctors and heads of surgical departments, and also contributes to the improvement of the outcome of operations. © Ján Užík, Olha Yeremenko, Natalia Sidelnyk, Tetyana Koriahinа, Mykola Mormul, 2023.},

	abstract = {Hypertension is an important risk factor for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and a leading cause of premature death. Epidemiological studies have found that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are associated with hypertension. However, the correlation between PFASs and hypertension has not been systematically reported. Based on evidence from population epidemiological surveys, we conducted a meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to assess the correlation between PFASs exposure and hypertension. In this study, three databases of PubMed, Web of science, Embase were searched and 13 literatures with 81,096 participants were included. Literature heterogeneity was evaluated by I2 statistic, and the random effect model (I2 > 50%) and fixed effect model (I2 < 50%) were used to combine the studies in meta-analysis. The results showed that PFNA (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.04–1.19), PFOA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.02–1.23), PFOS (OR = 1.19, 95% CI: 1.06–1.34) and PFHxS (OR = 1.03, 95% CI: 1.00–1.06) were significantly associated with hypertension, while other types of PFASs (∑PFAS, PFDA, PFUnDA) had no statistical significance. In addition, PFNA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.03–1.22), PFOA (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.01–1.25) and PFOS (OR = 1.12, 95% CI: 1.00–1.25) exposure were positively correlated with the risk of hypertension in men, but not in women. Our study reveals that PFASs are risk factors for hypertension, with notable gender differences observed in PFASs-exposed populations. Specifically, males exposed to PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS exhibit a higher risk of hypertension compared to females. However, further investigations are needed to delve into the precise mechanism through which PFASs contribute to the development of hypertension. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Coastal zones sustain extensive biodiversity, support key processes for ocean dynamics, and influence the balance of the global environment. They also provide resources and services to communities, determine their culture, and are the basis for their economic growth. Cartagena Bay in the Colombian Caribbean is the place of the establishment of one of the country’s main cities, which has a great historical and tourist attraction, and it is also the location of the main commercial port and a great variety of industries. Historically, it has been affected by several environmental impacts and intense pollution. This situation has gained the attention of different researchers, so herein is presented a literature review with a systematic approach using RStudio’s bibliometrix on the presence of pollutants and the impact on biodiversity in recent decades, providing a critical analysis of the state of Cartagena Bay and its future needs to ensure its recovery and conservation. In addition, the socioeconomic dynamics related to the environmental state of Cartagena Bay are presented from the framework drivers, pressures, status, impacts, and responses (DPSIR). The update and critical understanding of the sources, fate, and effects of pollution are important not only for the knowledge of the status of this singular ecosystem but also to encourage future research and entrench evidence to support decision makers’ actions. This review highlights that several pollutants that have been detected exceeding sediment quality guidelines, like As, Cd, Hg, and PAH, are also reported to bioaccumulate and cause damage throughout the trophic levels of the coastal environment. In addition, the potential use of sentinel species and biomarkers for their monitoring is discussed. Finally, the factors that cause pollution and threaten the state of the bay continue to exert pressure and impact; thus, there is a call for the further monitoring of this ecosystem and the strengthening of policies and regulations. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study evaluated the effectiveness of six Technosols designed for the remediation of polluted soils (PS) by metal(loid)s at physicochemical, biological, and ecotoxicological levels and at a microcosm scale. Technosols T1–T6 were prepared by combining PS with a mix of organic and inorganic wastes from mining, urban, and agro-industrial activities. After two months of surface application of Technosols on polluted soils, we analysed the soil properties, metal(loid) concentration in total, soluble and bioavailable fractions, soil enzymatic activities, and the growth responses of Trifolium campestre and Lactuca sativa in both the Technosols and the underlying polluted soils. All Technosols improved the unfavourable conditions of polluted soils by neutralising acidity, increasing the OC, reducing the mobility of most metal(loid)s, and stimulating both the soil enzymatic activities and growths of T. campestre and L. sativa. The origin of organic waste used in the Technosols strongly conditioned the changes induced in the polluted soils; in this sense, the Technosols composed of pruning and gardening vermicompost (T3 and T6) showed greater reductions in toxicity and plant growth than the other Technosols composed with different organic wastes. Thus, these Technosols constitute a potential solution for the remediation of persistent polluted soils that should be applied in large-scale and long-term interventions to reinforce their feasibility as a cost-effective ecotechnology. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Study Design: Narrative review. Objectives: The purpose of this review is to outline the role of sex hormones, particularly estrogen, in the pathogenesis of degenerative disc disease (DDD). Methods: A narrative review of studies discussing sex hormones and intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration was conducted through a search of bibliographic databases to identify various mechanisms involved in effectuating DDD. Results: Estrogen-deficient states negatively impact various aspects of IVD function. These internal hormone environments reflect routine changes that commonly arise with physiologic aging and can compromise IVD structural integrity through a host of processes. Additionally, allosteric molecules such as micro-RNAs (mi-RNAs) and G protein-coupled estrogen receptors (GPER) antagonists can bind to estrogen receptors and inhibit protective downstream effects with estrogen receptor signaling. Furthermore, cursory studies have observed chondrogenic effects with testosterone supplementation, although the specific mechanism remains unclear. Conclusions: Regulation of sex hormones, namely estrogen and testosterone, significantly impacts the structural integrity and function of IVDs.

	abstract = {Ferroptosis has been suggested to involve in doxorubicin (DOX)-induced cardiotoxicity. However, the underlying mechanisms and regulatory targets of cardiomyocyte ferroptosis remains to be understood. This study demonstrated that the up-regulation of ferroptosis associated proteins genes were accompanied with the down-regulation of AMPKα2 phosphorylation in DOX treated mouse heart or neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). AMPKα2 knockout (AMPKα2−/−) significantly exacerbated mouse cardiac dysfunction, increased mortality, promoting ferroptosis associated mitochondrial injuries, enhanced ferroptosis associated proteins and genes expression, and lead to accumulation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mouse serum and hearts respectively. Ferrostatin-1 administration markedly improved cardiac function, decreased mortality, inhibited mitochondrial injuries and ferroptosis associated proteins and genes expression, and depressed accumulation of LDH and MDA in DOX treated AMPKα2−/− mouse. Moreover, Adeno-associated virus serotype 9 AMPKα2 (AAV9-AMPKα2) or AICAR treatment mediated AMPKα2 activation could significantly improve cardiac function and depress ferroptosis in mouse. AMPKα2 activation or silence could also inhibit or promote ferroptosis associated injuries in DOX treated NRCMs respecitively. Mechanistically, AMPKα2/ACC mediated lipid metabolism has been suggested to involve in regulating DOX-treatment induced ferroptosis other than mTORC1 or autophagy dependent pathway. The metabolomics analysis exhibited that AMPKα2−/− significantly enhanced accumulation of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PFAs), oxidized lipid, and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Finally, this study also demonstrated that metformin (MET) treatment could inhibit ferroptosis and improve cardiac function via activating AMPKα2 phosphorylation. The metabolomics analysis exhibited that MET treatment significantly depressed PFAs accumulation in DOX treated mouse hearts. Collectively, this study suggested that AMPKα2 activation might protect against anthracycline chemotherapeutic drugs mediated cardiotoxicity via inhibiting ferroptosis. © 2023},

	abstract = {Background: Exposures to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoate (PFOA), environmentally persistent chemicals detectable in the blood of most Americans, have been associated with several health outcomes. To offer insight into their possible biologic effects, we evaluated the metabolomic correlates of circulating PFOS and PFOA among 3,647 participants in eight nested case-control serum metabolomic profiling studies from the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening Trial. Methods: Metabolomic profiling was conducted by Metabolon Inc., using ultra high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem accurate mass spectrometry. We conducted study-specific multivariable linear regression analyses estimating the associations of metabolite levels with levels of PFOS or PFOA. For metabolites measured in at least 3 of 8 nested case-control studies, random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize study-specific results (1,038 metabolites in PFOS analyses and 1,100 in PFOA analyses). Results: The meta-analysis identified 51 and 38 metabolites associated with PFOS and PFOA, respectively, at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level (4.8x10-5 and 4.6x10-5, respectively). For both PFOS and PFOA, the most common types of associated metabolites were lipids (sphingolipids, fatty acid metabolites) and xenobiotics (xanthine metabolites, chemicals). Positive associations were commonly observed with lipid metabolites sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0) (P = 2.0x10-10 and 2.0x10-8, respectively), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpropionate (P = 2.7x10-15, 1.1x10-17), and lignoceroylcarnitine (C24) (P = 2.6x10-8, 6.2x10-6). The strongest positive associations were observed for chemicals 3,5-dichloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (P = 3.0x10-112 and 6.8x10-13, respectively) and 3-bromo-5-chloro-2,6-dihydroxybenzoic acid (P = 1.6x10-14, 2.3x10-6). Other metabolites positively associated with PFOS included D-glucose (carbohydrate), carotene diol (vitamin A metabolism), and L-alpha-aminobutyric acid (glutathione metabolism), while uric acid (purine metabolite) was positively associated with PFOA. PFOS associations were consistent even after adjusting for PFOA as a covariate, while PFOA associations were greatly attenuated with PFOS adjustment. Conclusions: In this large metabolomic study, we observed robust positive associations with PFOS for several molecules. Further investigation of these metabolites may offer insight into PFOS-related biologic effects. © 2023},

	abstract = {Antibiotics and microplastics (MPs) are two emerging pollutants in agroecosystems, however the effects of co-exposure to antibiotics and MPs remain unclear. The toxicity of florfenicol (FF) and polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) on rice seedlings was investigated. FF and PS-MPs caused colloidal agglomeration, which changed the environmental behavior of FF. FF inhibited rice growth and altered antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) activities, leading to membrane lipid peroxidation; impaired photosynthetic systems, decreased photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b, and carotene), chlorophyll precursors (Proto IX, Mg-Proto IX, and Pchlide), photosynthetic and respiratory rates. The key photosynthesis related genes (PsaA, PsaB, PsbA, PsbB, PsbC, and PsbD) were significantly down-regulated. The ultrastructure of mesophyll cells was destroyed with chloroplast swelling, membrane surface blurring, irregular thylakoid lamellar structure, and number of peroxisomes increased. PS-MPs mitigated FF toxicity, and the IBR index values showed that 10 mg∙L−1 PS-MPs were more effective. Metabolomic analysis revealed that the abundance of metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered by FF, was greater than the combined “MPs-FF” contamination. The metabolism of amino acids, sugars, and organic acids were severely interfered. Among these, 15 metabolic pathways were significantly altered, with the most significant effects on phenylalanine metabolism and the citric acid cycle (p < 0.05). © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Toxicological studies have suggested that exposure to PFASs may lead to several adverse effects, including infertility and cancer development. In light of their widespread use, the contamination of food products has created health concerns in sites directly influenced by industrial and anthropogenic activity. In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination. Short-chain PFAS are suggested as chemicals of emerging concern to food security. However, the environmental and toxicological implications of short-chain congeners are not fully understood and, thus, much research is needed in this sense. © 2022, Association of Food Scientists & Technologists (India).},

	abstract = {Pesticide contamination in water resources is a global threat. Although usually found at low concentrations, pesticides raise considerable toxicological concerns, mainly when mixtures are considered. The occurrence of 22 pesticides (2,4 D, alachlor, aldicarb, aldrin, atrazine, carbendazim, carbofuran, chlordane, chlorpyrifos, DDT, diuron, glyphosate, lindane, mancozeb, methamidophos, metolachlor, molinate, profenofos, simazine, tebuconazole, terbufos, and trifluralin) was investigated, through consolidated database information, in surface freshwaters of Brazil. Moreover, scenarios of environmental risk assessment considering isolated compounds and mixtures were performed, as well as a meta-analytic approach for toxicity purposes. Pesticides in freshwater have been reported from 719 cities (12.9% of Brazilian cities), where 179 (3.2%) showed pesticide occurrence above the limit of detection or quantification. Considering cities with more than five quantified, 16 cities were prone to environmental risks considering individual risks. However, the number increased to 117 cities when the pesticide mixture was considered. The mixture risk was driven by atrazine, chlorpyrifos, and DDT. The national maximum acceptable concentrations (MAC) for nearly all pesticides are higher than the predicted no-effect concentration (PNEC) for the species evaluated, except aldrin. Our results show the need to consider mixtures in the environmental risk assessment to avoid underestimation and review MAC to protect aquatic ecosystems. The results presented here may guide the revision of the national environmental legislation to ensure the protection of Brazilian aquatic ecosystems. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Decabromodiphenyl ethane (DBDPE), a novel brominated flame retardant, is becoming increasingly prevalent in environmental and biota samples. While DBDPE has been shown to cause various biological adverse effects, the molecular mechanism behind these effects is still unclear. In this research, zebrafish embryos were exposed to DBDPE (50-400 μg/L) until 120 h post fertilization (hpf). The results confirmed the neurotoxicity by increased average swimming speed, interfered neurotransmitter contents, and transcription of neurodevelopment-related genes in zebrafish larvae. Metabolomics analysis revealed changes of metabolites primarily involved in glycolipid metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, and oxidative stress, which were validated through the alterations of multiple biomarkers at various levels. We further evaluated the mitochondrial performance upon DBDPE exposure and found inhibited mitochondrial oxidative respiration accompanied by decreased mitochondrial respiratory chain complex activities, mitochondrial membrane potential, and ATP contents. However, addition of nicotinamide riboside could effectively restore DBDPE-induced mitochondrial impairments and resultant neurotoxicity, oxidative stress as well as glycolipid metabolism in zebrafish larvae. Taken together, our data suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction was involved in DBDPE-induced toxicity, providing novel insight into the toxic mechanisms of DBDPE as well as other emerging pollutants. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Environmental exposures may influence sleep; however, the contributions of environmental chemical pollutants to sleep health have not been systematically investigated. We conducted a systematic review to identify, evaluate, summarize, and synthesize the existing evidence between chemical pollutants (air pollution, exposures related to the Gulf War and other conflicts, endocrine disruptors, metals, pesticides, solvents) and dimensions of sleep health (architecture, duration, quality, timing) and disorders (sleeping pill use, insomnia, sleep-disordered breathing)). Of the 204 included studies, results were mixed; however, the synthesized evidence suggested associations between particulate matter, exposures related to the Gulf War, dioxin and dioxin-like compounds, and pesticide exposure with worse sleep quality; exposures related to the Gulf War, aluminum, and mercury with insomnia and impaired sleep maintenance; and associations between tobacco smoke exposure with insomnia and sleep-disordered breathing, particularly in pediatric populations. Possible mechanisms relate to cholinergic signaling, neurotransmission, and inflammation. Chemical pollutants are likely key determinants of sleep health and disorders. Future studies should aim to evaluate environmental exposures on sleep across the lifespan, with a particular focus on developmental windows and biological mechanisms, as well as in historically marginalized or excluded populations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Purpose: Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) reduce acid secretion in the stomach and rank as one of the most widely used acid-suppressing medicines globally. While PPIs are safe in the short-term, emerging evidence shows risks associated with long-term use. Current evidence on global PPI use is scarce. This systematic review aims to evaluate global PPI use in the general population. Methods: Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts were systematically searched from inception to 31 March 2023 to identify observational studies on oral PPI use among individuals aged ≥ 18 years. PPI use was classified by demographics and medication factors (dose, duration, and PPI types). The absolute numbers of PPI users for each subcategory were summed and expressed as a percentage. Results: The search identified data from 28 million PPI users in 23 countries from 65 articles. This review indicated that nearly one-quarter of adults use a PPI. Of those using PPIs, 63% were less than 65 years. 56% of PPI users were female, and “White” ethnicities accounted for 75% of users. Nearly two-thirds of users were on high doses (≥ defined daily dose (DDD)), 25% of users continued PPIs for > 1 year, and 28% of these continued for > 3 years. Conclusion: Given the widespread use PPIs and increasing concern regarding long-term use, this review provides a catalyst to support more rational use, particularly with unnecessary prolonged continuation. Clinicians should review PPI prescriptions regularly and deprescribe when there is no appropriate ongoing indication or evidence of benefit to reduce health harm and treatment cost. © 2023, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Maternal pesticide exposure might be associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes through triggering inflammation and oxidative stress and disrupting endocrine functions. Yet the association between prenatal pesticide exposure and risk of preterm birth remains inconclusive. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of human observational studies using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) framework to explore the association of per ten-fold increase of pesticide concentrations in maternal biological samples during pregnancy with risk of preterm birth and length of gestational age at birth. Data source: Five English (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus) and 3 Chinese databases (China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)) were searched till Jan 18th, 2023. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: To be included, pesticide exposure should be measured in maternal biological samples during pregnancy and in log-transformed forms. The primary outcome was preterm birth and the secondary outcome was gestational age at birth. Study appraisal, synthesis methods and confidence assessment: Quality of studies was evaluated using OHAT Risk of Bias Tool. Evidence was quantitatively synthesized with Correlated and Hierarchical Effects (CHE) model. The confidence rating in the body of evidence was done using OHAT. Results: A total of 21 studies reported by 18 papers were included, with 7 studies for preterm birth and 19 for gestational age at birth. The meta-analysis found a ten-fold increase of pesticide concentrations was potentially associated with risk of preterm birth (pooled OR = 1.28; 95%CI: 0.93, 1.78) and shortened gestational age at birth (β = −0.10; 95%CI: −0.21, 0.01). Sampling biospecimens in different trimesters was identified as a potential modifier in the association between pesticide exposure and length of gestational age (F = 2.77, P < 0.05). For studies that collected samples at any time during pregnancy, pesticide exposure was found to be associated with shortened length of gestational age (β = −0.43; 95%CI: −0.81, −0.06). The confidence rating in the body of evidence was “moderate” and “very low” for preterm birth and gestational age at birth, respectively. Conclusion: Our result suggested moderate evidence of an association between pesticide exposure and higher risk of preterm birth. Yet more studies are still needed with larger sample size and careful considerations of confounders and accuracy of outcome measurements. Attention is also required on other pesticide compounds in addition to organochlorine and organophosphorus pesticides, and on windows of susceptibility. © 2023 The Author(s)},

This article systematically reviews the interaction of microplastics with antibiotics and the antibiotic resistant genes in microbes. Also, the environmental impacts of the composite pollutants are described. In addition to water media, this article also describes the composite pollution in soil and provides a deeper understanding of the adsorption-desorption of the combined contaminant. Furthermore, the mechanism between antibiotics and microplastics is summarized with different interactions and molecular effects. Moreover, future research directions and solutions are provided for the combined pollution, through the full understanding of the antibiotic resistant ecosystems formed by microplastics.

	abstract = {Abstract: Indole and its derivatives are typical nitrogen heterocyclic compounds and have been of immense concern since they are known for the risk of their toxic, recalcitrant, and carcinogenic properties for human, animals and ecological environment. Bacteria play vital role in the degradation and biotransformation of such persistent organic and harmful pollutants. In this experiment, Acinetobacter towneri NTA1-2A and Acinetobacter guillouiae TAT1-6A were used to degrade indole. Indole-degradated metabolites were analyzed by metabolomics analysis of fermentation broth of these strains using LC-MS/MS. The metabolomics analysis showed indole-5-carbonitrile 3-benzoyl (C16H10N2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (C2H6OS), deoxyguanosine (C10H13N5O4), Leu (C6H13NO2), and N-nitroso-pyrrolidine were indole-degradated metabolites formed by A. towneri NTA1-2A while neurine (C5H13NO) and norvaline (C5H11NO2) are common metabolites of both strains. The two strains' degradation metabolites differed from those reported in other studies, demonstrating the diversity of the distinct microbial strains approach to the metabolism of indolic compounds. Extracellular enzymes released to culture medium by these bacteria were also identified. In conclusion, the two bacterial strains have a potential of converting notorious indole compound to non-toxic intermediates mediated by enzymes. Hence, future study should focus on biochemical pathway and genetic basis for indole-degradated metabolites in the two strains. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

	abstract = {Pyrethroid insecticides (PIs), a class of structurally similar non-persistent organic pollutants, can be degraded and metabolized to more toxic, and longer half-life products. In this study, the binding interaction mechanisms between human serum albumin (HSA) and the main degradation metabolites of PIs, 3-phenoxybenzoic acid (3-PBA) and 4-fluoro-3-phenoxybenzoic acid (4-F-3-PBA), were studied by theoretical simulation and experimental verification. Steady state fluorescence spectra showed that the fluorescence quenching mechanism was static. According to the binding constant, 4-F-3-PBA (1.53 × 105 L mol−1) was bound more strongly to HSA than 3-PBA (1.42 × 105 L mol−1) in subdomain ⅡA (site I). It was found by isothermal titration calorimetry that the metabolites and HSA spontaneously combined mainly through hydrogen bond and van der Waals interaction. Ultraviolet absorption spectra and circular dichroism spectra showed that the metabolites caused slight changes in the microenvironment and conformation of HSA. The above results were proved by molecular docking. The toxicity properties of the metabolites were further analyzed by software, and 4-F-3-PBA was found to be more toxic than 3-PBA. Considering the high exposure level of these metabolites in food, the environment and human body, it is necessary to further explore the toxicity of PIs metabolites. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

More specifically, a number of studies have reported the impact of Aldrin on a variety of cancer types, including prostate cancer. In previous studies, we demonstrated the induction of the malignant phenotype in DU145 prostate cancer (PCa) cells after a chronic exposure to Aldrin (an ED). Proteins are pivotal in the regulation and control of a variety of cellular processes. However, the mechanisms responsible for the impact of ED on PCa and the role of proteins in this process are not yet well understood. Here, two complementary computational approaches have been employed to investigate the molecular processes underlying the acquisition of malignancy in prostate cancer. First, the metabolic reprogramming associated with the chronic exposure to Aldrin in DU145 cells was studied by integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics via constraint-based metabolic modeling. Second, gene set enrichment analysis was applied to determine (i) altered regulatory pathways and (ii) the correlation between changes in the transcriptomic profile of Aldrin-exposed cells and tumor progression in various types of cancer. Experimental validation confirmed predictions revealing a disruption in metabolic and regulatory pathways. This alteration results in the modification of protein levels crucial in regulating triacylglyceride/cholesterol, linked to the malignant phenotype observed in Aldrin-exposed cells. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Marine mammals, due to their long life span, key position in the food web, and large lipid deposits, often face significant health risks from accumulating contaminants. This systematic review examines published literature on pollutant-induced adverse health effects in the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red-listed marine mammal species. Thereby, identifying gaps in literature across different extinction risk categories, spatial distribution and climatic zones of studied habitats, commonly used methodologies, researched pollutants, and mechanisms from cellular to population levels. Our findings reveal a lower availability of exposure-effect data for higher extinction risk species (critically endangered 16%, endangered 15%, vulnerable 66%), highlighting the need for more research. For many threatened species in the Southern Hemisphere pollutant-effect relationships are not established. Non-destructively sampled tissues, like blood or skin, are commonly measured for exposure assessment. The most studied pollutants are POPs (31%), metals (30%), and pesticides (17%). Research on mixture toxicity is scarce while pollution-effect studies primarily focus on molecular and cellular levels. Bridging the gap between molecular data and higher-level effects is crucial, with computational approaches offering a high potential through in vitro to in vivo extrapolation using (toxico-)kinetic modelling. This could aid in population-level risk assessment for threatened marine mammals. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Polybrominated biphenyls (PBB) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) are persistent organic pollutants with potential endocrine-disrupting effects linked to adverse health outcomes. OBJECTIVES: In this study, we utilize high-resolution metabolomics (HRM) to identify internal exposure and biological responses underlying PCB and multigenerational PBB exposure for participants enrolled in the Michigan PBB Registry. METHODS: HRM profiling was conducted on plasma samples collected from 2013 to 2014 from a subset of participants enrolled in the Michigan PBB Registry, including 369 directly exposed individuals (F0) who were alive when PBB mixtures were accidentally introduced into the food chain and 129 participants exposed to PBB in utero or through breastfeeding, if applicable (F1). Metabolome-wide association studies were performed for PBB-153 separately for each generation and RPCB (PCB-118, PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-180) in the two generations combined, as both had direct PCB exposure. Metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations were evaluated following a well-established untargeted HRM workflow. RESULTS: Mean levels were 1:75 ng/mL [standard deviation (SD): 13.9] for PBB-153 and 1:04 ng/mL (SD: 0.788) for RPCB. Sixty-two and 26 metabolic features were significantly associated with PBB-153 in F0 and F1 [false discovery rate (FDR) p < 0:2], respectively. There were 2,861 features associated with RPCB (FDR p < 0:2). Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis using a bioinformatics tool revealed perturbations associated with RPCB in numerous oxidative stress and inflammation pathways (e.g., carnitine shuttle, glycosphingolipid, and vitamin B9 metabolism). Metabolic perturbations associated with PBB-153 in F0 were related to oxidative stress (e.g., pentose phosphate and vitamin C metabolism) and in F1 were related to energy production (e.g., pyrimidine, amino sugars, and lysine metabolism). Using authentic chemical standards, we confirmed the chemical identity of 29 metabolites associated with RPCB levels (level 1 evidence). CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that serum PBB-153 is associated with alterations in inflammation and oxidative stress-related pathways, which differed when stratified by generation. We also found that RPCB was associated with the downregulation of important neurotransmitters, sero-tonin, and 4-aminobutanoate. These findings provide novel insights for future investigations of molecular mechanisms underlying PBB and PCB ex-posure on health. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

	abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl acids (PFAAs) are ubiquitous in environment, which have attracted increasing concerns in recent years. This study collected the data on PFAAs concentrations in 1042 soil samples from 15 countries and comprehensively reviewed the spatial distribution, sources, sorption mechanisms of PFAAs in soil and their plant uptake. PFAAs are widely detected in soils from many countries worldwide and their distribution is related to the emission of the fluorine-containing organic industry. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are found to be the predominant PFAAs in soil. Industrial emission is the main source of PFAAs contributing 49.9% of the total concentrations of PFAAs (Ʃ PFAAs) in soil, followed by activated sludge treated by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (19.9%) and irrigation of effluents from WWTPs, usage of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFFs) and leaching of leachate from landfill (30.2%). The adsorption of PFAAs by soil is mainly influenced by soil pH, ionic strength, soil organic matter and minerals. The concentrations of perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) in soil are negatively correlated with the length of carbon chain, log Kow, and log Koc. The carbon chain lengths of PFAAs are negatively correlated with the root-soil concentration factors (RCFs) and shoot-soil concentration factors (SCFs). The uptake of PFAAs by plant is influenced by physicochemical properties of PFAAs, plant physiology and soil environment. Further studies should be conducted to make up the inadequacy of existing knowledge on the behavior and fate of PFAAs in soil-plant system. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP), including gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE), cause significant morbidity and mortality among pregnant women. Several environmental toxins, particularly those that affect the normal function of the placenta and the endothelium, are emerging as potential risk factors for HDP. Among them, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), widely used in a variety of commercial products, have been related to a variety of adverse health effects including HDP. This study was conducted by searching three databases for observational studies reporting associations between PFAS and HDP, all of which were published before December 2022. We used random-effects meta-analysis to calculate pooled risk estimates, and assessing each combination of exposure and outcome for quality and level of evidence. In total, 15 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. The results from meta-analyses showed that risk of PE was increased with exposure to PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.05, 1.85; N = 6 studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty), PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonate) (RR = 1.51, 95% CI = 1.23, 1.86; N = 6 studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; moderate certainty), and PFHxS (perfluorohexane sulfonate) (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.76; N = 6 studies; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty). PFOS was also associated with an increased risk of HDP (RR = 1.39, 95% CI = 1.10, 1.76; exposure = 1 ln-unit increment; low certainty). Exposure to legacy PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS) is associated with an increased risk of PE, and PFOS is further associated with HDP. In view of the limitations of meta-analysis and quality of evidence, these findings should be interpreted with caution. Further research is required that assesses exposure to multiple PFAS in diverse and well-powered cohorts. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Falls in older people are common, leading to significant harm including death. Coroners have a duty to report cases where action should be taken to prevent future deaths, but dissemination of their findings remains poor. Objective: To identify preventable fall-related deaths, classify coroner concerns and explore organisational responses. Design: A retrospective systematic case series of coroners' Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, from July 2013 (inception) to November 2022. Setting: England and Wales. Methods: Reproducible data collection methods were used to web-scrape and read PFD reports. Demographic information, coroner concerns and responses from organisations were extracted and descriptive statistics used to synthesise data. Results: Five hundred and twenty-seven PFDs (12.5% of PFDs) involved a fall that contributed to death. These deaths predominantly affected older people (median 82 years) in the community (72%), with subsequent death in hospital (70.8%). A high proportion of cases experienced fractures (51.6%), major bleeding (35.9%) or head injury (38.7%). Coroners frequently raised concerns regarding falls risks assessments (20.9%), failures in communication (20.3%) and documentation issues (17.5%). Only 56.7% of PFDs received a response from organisations to whom they were addressed. Organisations tended to produce new protocols (58.5%), improve training (44.6%) and commence audits (34.3%) in response to PFDs. Conclusions: One in eight preventable deaths in England and Wales involved a fall. Addressing concerns raised by coroners should improve falls prevention and care following falls especially for older adults, but the poor response rate may indicate that lessons are not being learned. Wider dissemination of PFD findings may help reduce preventable fall-related deaths in the future. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Zeolite A was synthesized via a two-step hydrothermal transformation of kaolin. The kaolin was first transformed to meta kaolin by calcination at 600OC, then treated with 3M NaOH solution (1:5 ration) in a stainless-steel autoclave with a teflon liner. The mixture was heated to 121°C for 2h to insert the sodium ions into the metakaolin structure. The treated kaolin clay was washed three times with deionized water to remove the excess unreacted NaOH, filtered and dried in an oven at 100°C overnight. Different analytical techniques were used to characterize the synthesized Zeolite A and the individual zeolie/metal oxide nanocomposites including X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray (EDX), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), Furrier transform infrared (FTIR), and Brunnuer Emmett teller (BET) analysis. FTIR confirmed the presence of Si-O, Si-Al, Al-O, and metal oxygen bonds. SEM/EDX revealed a cubic morphology with some bigger particles that are mono dispersed and partially spherical, along with different compositions of the elements present. XRD showed a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure with 25.73 nm lattice, while XRF confirmed the presence of SiO2, Al2 O3 as well as with different major and trace metal oxides. The BET analysis showed 3.9457 and 4.3044 (m2/g), 0.6032 and 0.5598 (cm3/g), 603.087 and 617.503(Ǻ) for both the kaolin clay and the synthesized zeolite A, respectively.

	abstract = {The ecotoxicity of perfluorooctane sulfonate(PFOS) to plants has been reported, but the lack of study on the effect of PFOS isomers is of concern. In this paper, the effect mechanism of Arabidopsis thaliana(A. thaliana) against two different concentrations of L-PFOS or perfluoro-3-methylheptanesulfonate (P3MHpS) was investigated via metabolomics. The metabolism of Arabidopsis thaliana leaves was investigated via the metabolomics strategy and statistical analysis. And 41 biomarkers for L-PFOS and 32 biomarkers for P3MHpS were found and identified. There was no significant difference of saccharides between L-PFOS and P3MHpS. More amino acids were affected by P3MHpS than by L-PFOS in high-level exposure group, while the opposite phenomenon was observed in low-level exposure group. More phytohormones were affected by L-PFOS than by P3MHpS in the high-level exposure group, however, the elevated level of indole phytohormones was significantly higher by P3MHpS than by L-PFOS. The level of up-regulation of (poly)phenols in L-PFOS group was significantly higher than that in P3MHpS group. The affected aliphatic glucosinolate metabolism was firstly observed with higher up-regulation induced by L-PFOS than by P3MHpS. New insight of phytotoxicity of PFOS isomers to plants was provided.[Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2023, Jilin University, The Editorial Department of Chemical Research in Chinese Universities and Springer-Verlag GmbH.},

	abstract = {In this study, a meta-analysis was conducted to comprehensively analyse the effectiveness of using proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) and dynamic hip screws (DHS) to treat intertrochanteric fractures on postoperative surgical site infections (SSI). PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang databases were searched from their inception until December 2022 to identify studies that compared PFNA and DHS in the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures. Two investigators independently screened the retrieved studies to assess their quality and verify their eligibility for inclusion. Meta-analyses were performed with RevMan 5.4 software. Thirty studies, including 3158 patients, met the inclusion criteria. These studies included 1574 patients treated with PFNA, and 1584 were treated with DHS. The findings of the meta-analysis revealed a significant reduction in the incidence of SSI in patients treated with PFNA compared with those treated with DHS (2.64% vs 6.76%, odds ratio [OR]: 0.40, 95% confidence intervals [CIs]: 0.28–0.57, P <.001), superficial SSI (2.58% vs 5.01%, OR: 0.53, 95% CIs: 0.33–0.85, P =.008) and deep SSI (1.26% vs 3.43%, OR: 0.41, 95% CIs: 0.19–0.92, P =.03). PFNA was more effective than DHS in reducing the incidence of SSI. Even so, significant variations in sample sizes among the included studies meant that the methodology for some studies had qualitative deficiencies. Therefore, additional studies with large sample sizes are needed to validate these results. © 2023 The Authors.

	abstract = {Perfluorohexyl sulfonate (PFHxS) is the third most abundant per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances and its developmental toxicity remains very poorly understood. Here, pregnant mice exposed to PFHxS at human relevant dose showed increased fetal death incidence in the high-dose PFHxS-H group (P < 0.01). Body distribution analyses suggested that PFHxS crossed the placental barrier reaching the fetus in a dose-dependent manner. Histopathological data demonstrated impairment in the placenta with reduced blood sinus volume, placental labyrinth area as well as thickness of labyrinthine layer. Further lipidomic and transcriptomic data together showed that PFHxS exposure caused significant disruption in placental lipid homeostasis, including total lipid accumulation in the placenta, and dysregulation in phospholipid and glycerol lipid metabolism. Gene expression analyses uncovered elevation in key placental fatty acid transporters including fabp2, whereas protein expression showed transporter specific disruptions following exposure. Together, gestational exposure to human relevant level of PFHxS may increase the incidence of fetal deaths and caused placental dysplasia via disruption in lipid metabolism homeostasis. These findings raise the concern regarding the highly prevalent and persistent chemical towards early sensitive developing stages and provide basis for further understanding of its effects on lipid metabolism and underlying mechanisms. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Introduction: Although house flies (Musca domestica) do not directly cause disease in humans, they transmit pathogens to them, which provide the basis for many diseases. The main way to deal with this insect is to use insecticides. Due to the resistance from insecticides, the fight against house flies has been hampered. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies worldwide. Methods: This study was conducted via a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies. Accordingly, by searching the databases of Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Proquest, Bioone, and Embase, all published articles were extracted, and reviewed until the end of May 2022. Statistical data analysis was performed using the random-effects model in the meta-analysis, meta-regression, and I2 index. Results: Nine studies entered the meta-analysis process. Based on this, the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticide in house flies was estimated to be 49.1%. Meta-regression showed that the prevalence of knockdown resistance increased with increasing years of study but decreased with increasing sample size. Conclusion: According to the findings, about 50% of house flies have knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticide. As a result, it is necessary to adopt effective and combined methods to combat this insect to control it and prevent the transmission of diseases caused by it. © 2023},

	abstract = {Lindane or gamma- hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) isomer has been one of the most extensively used pesticides worldwide. However, four additional Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers were produced during its manufacture, resulting in persistence in the environment due to their dissolvability and noxiousness. This study examines the sequential anaerobic-aerobic degradation of synthetically prepared solution of technical HCH (t-HCH) utilizing a hybrid reactor system with a UASB reactor coupled to the aerobic system. The ideal conditions for t-HCH degradation were initial substrate concentration (100 mg L−1), glucose as suitable electron donor, active biomass (12 g L−1), pH (neutral range), HRT (48 h) and organic loading rate (4.28 mg/g/day). Individual reactor findings demonstrated that the UASB reactor performed efficiently with these parameters, showing 90.03% degradation of 100 mg L−1 t-HCH in two days after a month of operation. In aerobic degradation, the selected isolate can break down 87% of 100 mg L−1 of t-HCH in eight days. Subsequent to individual reactor operations, the reactors were synchronized in the hybrid reactor and after 60 days of continuous operation, t-HCH was dechlorinated completely in the presence of glucose as a co-substrate. Therefore, compared to individual anaerobic and aerobic treatments, this sequential degradation showed an improvement in HCH removal efficiency of > 99%. This is the first study that demonstrates the mineralization of HCH intermediates in a hybrid reactor system. The metagenomic analysis of the anaerobic sludge and bacterial isolate's whole genome sequencing further authenticates the genomic aspects of the degradation process by the presence of HCH degrading genera and functional HCH degrading genes. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

Strategies to monitor this stress hormone and its correlation to food quality and security have been studied in fish farming and the livestock industry. This review discusses studies on monitoring cortisol in the food industry for the first time. The impact of cortisol on animal production, quality, and the security of food products, and the analytical procedures commonly implemented for sample pre-concentration and quantification by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, are reviewed and discussed according to the results published in the period 2012–2022. Aquaculture, or fish farming, is the leading agri-food sector, where cortisol’s impact and usefulness are better known than in livestock. The determination of cortisol in fish not only allows for an increase in the production rate, but also the ability to monitor the water quality, enhancing the sustainable development of this industry. In cattle, further studies are needed since it has mainly been used to detect the administration of illicit substances. Current analytical control and monitoring techniques are expensive and often depend on invasive sampling, not allowing fast or real-time monitoring. © 2023 by the authors.},

There are currently just a few investigations on the combined toxicity of PFAS and MP on freshwater microalgae. In this research, the combined toxicity of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to Microcystis aeruginosa was investigated. The results indicated that the combination of these pollutants inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa and promoted the synthesis and release of Microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Individual and combined exposure caused different responses to cellular oxidative stress. Under the Individual exposure of PFOA, when the concentration was greater than 20.0 mg/L, the catalase (CAT) activity increased significantly, and when it was greater than 100.0 mg/L, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased significantly, but there is no significant change under combined exposure. PVC and PFOA exposure also caused physical damage to the algal cells and reduced the content of extracellular polymer substances (EPS) based on analysis of cell morphology. Metabolic analysis revealed that carbohydrate metabolism and amino acid metabolism of the algae were affected. The current study offers a fresh theoretical framework for MPs and PFASs environmental risk evaluations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Due to its widespread occurrence in practically all environmental sectors, including the terrestrial, marine, and atmospheric, microplastics (MP) have transitioned from an emerging pollutant to a chronic contaminant. Studies on the prevalence and hazardous effects on marine creatures have been conducted all over the world, but only in coastal environments. Microplastic pollution has emerged as a global concern in marine environments and a danger to animals, predators, and humans because it has been discovered in the marine environment all over the world. This review examines the quantity of MP samples around the world and their colonization by marine microorganisms, as well as the detection, features, origins, and ecological implications of paint fragments and resins in our oceans and ports. These polymers are derived from paints and the fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) matrix used in shipbuilding. Microplastics should be regarded as coming from synthetic polymers found in ship coatings. For assessing microplastic pollution, choosing an appropriate sample technique is essential. Additionally, this review offers an overview of MP investigation methods, concentrating on sampling techniques, laboratory procedures, and the identification of MPs found in seawater, as well as assessing how well they apply to the seaport environment. Because of the widespread discovery of MP pollution, particularly in Africa, Asia, India, South Africa, North America, and Europe, it is clear that monitoring is crucial for determining the efficacy of mitigation efforts to limit the quantity of waste plastic entering the environment, especially through sensors and real-time information transfer systems (e.g., smart digital seawater monitoring). © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Mosses are particularly suitable for recording the accumulation of atmospheric substance inputs in large areas at relatively many locations. In Europe, this has been done every five years since 1990 as part of the European Moss Survey. In this framework, mosses were collected at up to 7312 sites in up to 34 countries and chemically analyzed for metals (since 1990), nitrogen (since 2005), persistent organic pollutants (since 2010) and microplastic (since 2015). The present investigation aimed at determining the nitrogen accumulated in three-year-old shoots from mosses collected in Germany in 2020 by quality-controlled sampling and chemical analysis according to the European Moss Survey Protocol (ICP Vegetation 2020). The spatial structure of the measurement values was analyzed by means of Variogram Analysis, and the respective function was used for Kriging-Interpolation. In addition to mapping the nitrogen values according to the international classification, maps based on 10 percentile classes were calculated. Maps for the Moss Survey 2020 data were compared with respective maps produced from the 2005 and 2015 Moss Survey data. Trends in Germany-wide nitrogen medians over the past three campaigns (2005, 2015 and 2020) show that nitrogen medians decreased by −2 % between 2005 and 2015 and increased by +8 % between 2015 and 2020. These differences are not significant and do not match the emission trends. Therefore, emission register data needs to be controlled by monitoring nitrogen deposition with technical and biological samplers and deposition modelling. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The fallopian tubes (FTs) are part of the female upper genital tract. The healthy FT provides the biological environment for successful fertilization and facilitates the subsequent movement of the conceptus to the endometrial cavity. However, when the FT is damaged, as with salpingitis, pyosalpinx, and hydrosalpinx, it may increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition. Decidualization refers to a multifactorial process by which the endometrium changes to permit blastocyst implantation. The decidualization reaction is vital for endometrial receptivity during the window of implantation. To date, no comprehensive review that collates evidence on decidualization in the human FT has been conducted. Therefore, the aim of this review is to compile the current evidence on cellular decidualization occurring in the healthy and pathological FT in women of reproductive age. A literature search was conducted using five databases and identified 746 articles, 24 of which were analyzed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The available evidence indicates that the FT are able to undergo decidual changes under specific circumstances; however, the exact mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which decidualization can occur in the FT. © The Author(s) 2023.

	abstract = {Many human diseases such as cancer, neurological diseases, autism and diabetes are associated with exposure to pesticides, especially organochlorine pesticides. However, pesticide exposure is also associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD) as the leading cause of death worldwide. In this systematic review, results on the link between organochlorine pesticide pollution and CVD were collected from databases (Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Science Direct) in May 2022 from studies published between 2010 and 2022. A total of 24 articles were selected for this systematic review. Sixteen articles were extracted by reviewers using a standardized form that included cross-sectional, cohort, and ecological studies that reported exposure to organochlorine pesticides in association with increased CVD risk. In addition, eight articles covering molecular mechanisms organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on cardiovascular effects were retrieved for detailed evaluation. Based on the findings of the study, it seems elevated circulating levels of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs increase the risk of coronary heart disease, especially in early life exposure to these pesticides and especially in men. Changes in the regulatory function of peroxisome proliferator-activated γ receptor (PPARγ), reduction of paroxonase activity (PON1), epigenetic changes of histone through induction of reactive oxygen species, vascular endothelial inflammation with miR-expression 126 and miR-31, increased collagen synthesis enzymes in the extracellular matrix and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and fibrosis are mechanisms by which PCBs increase the risk of CVD. According to this systematic review, organochlorine pesticide exposure is associated with increased risk of CVD and CVD mortality through the atherogenic and inflammatory molecular mechanism involving fatty acid and glucose metabolism. © 2023 Academy of Medical Sciences of I.R.

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are ubiquitous emerging pollutants that have been found in the marine, freshwater, air, and soil environments. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in releasing MPs to the environment. Therefore, understanding the occurrence, fate, and removal mechanism of MPs in WWTPs is of great importance towards microplastie control. In this review, the occurrence characteristics and removal rates of MPs in 78 WWTPs from 57 studies were discussed based on Metaanalysis. Specifically, the key aspects regarding MPs removal in WWTPs, such as wastewater treatment processes and MPs shapes, sizes, and polymer compositions were analyzed and compared. The results showed that; CD the abundances of MPs in the influent and effluent were 1.56×10-2-3.14 ×10-4n·L-1and 1.70×10-3-3.09×102n·L-1, respectively. The abundance of MPs in the sludge ranged from 1. 80 × 10-1to 9.38 × 103n·g-1. (2) The total removal rate (>90% ) of MPs by WWTPs using oxidation ditch, biofilm, and conventional activated sludge treatment processes was higher than that using sequencing batch activated sludge, anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic, and anoxic-aerobic processes. (3) The removal rate of MPs in primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment process were 62.87%, 55.78%, and 58.45%, respectively. The combination process of "grid + sedimentation tank + primary sedimentation tank" had the highest removal rate towards MPs in primary treatment processes, and the membrane bioreactor had the highest one beyond other secondary treatment processes. Filtration was the best process in tertiary treatment. (4) The film, foam, and fragment MPs were easier to remove (>90% ) than fiber and spherical (<90%) MPs by WWTPs. The MPs with particle size larger than 0.5 mm were easier to remove than those with particle size smaller than 0. 5 mm. The removal efficiencies of polyethylene (PE), polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and polypropylene (PP) MPs were higher than 80%. © 2023 Science Press. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and pathogens are emerging environmental pollutants that pose a threat to human health and ecosystem. Industrial park wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treat large amounts of comprehensive wastewater derived from industrial production and park human activity, which is possible a source of ARGs and pathogens. Therefore, this study investigated the occurrence and prevalence of ARGs, ARGs hosts and pathogens and assesses the ARGs health risk in the biological treatment process in a large-sale industrial park WWTP using metagenomic analysis and omics-based framework, respectively. Results show that the major ARG subtypes are multidrug resistance genes (MDRGs), macB, tetA(58), evgS, novA, msbA and bcrA and the ARGs main hosts were genus Acidovorax, Pseudomonas, Mesorhizobium. In particular, all determined ARGs genus level hosts are pathogens. The total removal percentage of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens were 12.77 %, 12.96 % and 25.71 % respectively, suggesting that the present treatment could not efficiently remove these pollutants. The relative abundance of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens varied along biological treatment process that ARGs and MDRGs were enriched in activated sludge and pathogens were enriched in both secondary sedimentation tank and activated sludge. Among 980 known ARGs, 23 ARGs (e.g., ermB, gadX and tetM) were assigned into risk Rank I with characters of enrichment in the human-associated environment, gene mobility and pathogenicity. The results indicate that industrial park WWTPs might serve as an important source of ARGs, MDRGs, and pathogens. These observations invite further study of the origination, development, dissemination and risk assessment of industrial park WWTPs ARGs and pathogens. © 2023},

	abstract = {In rural areas of the United States, an estimated ~1.8 million people lack reliable access to safe drinking water. Considering the relative dearth of information on water contamination and health outcomes in Appalachia, we conducted a systematic review of studies of microbiological and chemical drinking water contamination and associated health outcomes in rural Appalachia. We pre-registered our protocols, limiting eligibility to primary data studies published from 2000 to 2019, and searched four databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library). We used qualitative syntheses, meta-analyses, risk of bias analysis, and meta-regression to assess reported findings, with reference to US EPA drinking water standards. Of the 3452 records identified for screening, 85 met our eligibility criteria. 93 % of eligible studies (n = 79) used cross-sectional designs. Most studies were conducted in Northern (32 %, n = 27) and North Central (24 %, n = 20) Appalachia, and only 6 % (n = 5) were conducted exclusively in Central Appalachia. Across studies, E. coli were detected in 10.6 % of samples (sample-size-weighted mean percentage from 4671 samples, 14 publications). Among chemical contaminants, sample-size-weighted mean concentrations for arsenic were 0.010 mg/L (n = 21,262 samples, 6 publications), and 0.009 mg/L for lead (n = 23,259, 5 publications). 32 % (n = 27) of studies assessed health outcomes, but only 4.7 % (n = 4) used case-control or cohort designs (all others were cross-sectional). The most commonly reported outcomes were detection of PFAS in blood serum (n = 13), gastrointestinal illness (n = 5), and cardiovascular-related outcomes (n = 4). Of the 27 studies that assessed health outcomes, 62.9 % (n = 17) appeared to be associated with water contamination events that had received national media attention. Overall, based on the number and quality of eligible studies identified, we could not reach clear conclusions about the state of water quality, or its impacts on health, in any of Appalachia's subregions.

	abstract = {Except for known sociodemographic factors, long-term exposure to environmental pollutants has been shown to contribute to the development of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), but the conclusions remain controversial. To provide a comprehensive overview of the association between environmental pollutants and GDM, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis. Several electronic databases (PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline and Cochrane) were searched for related epidemiological and experimental studies up to September 2022. For epidemiological studies, a meta-analysis was carried out to appraise the effect of environmental pollutants, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), phenols, phthalates (PAEs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and parabens exposure on GDM. Moreover, we also summarized possible biological mechanisms linking pollution exposure and GDM based on the included experimental studies. A total of 80 articles were enrolled, including 38 epidemiological studies and 42 experimental studies. Meta-analysis results showed that exposure to PAEs [OR (95%CI) = 1.07 (1.00, 1.14)], PFASs [OR (95%CI) = 1.10 (1.01, 1.19)], as well as PCBs [OR (95%CI) = 1.18 (1.02, 1.36)] and PBDEs [OR (95%CI) = 1.33 (1.17, 1.50)] significantly increased the risk of GDM, but no significant effects were found for phenols, OCPs, and parabens. In addition, experimental studies suggested that the potential biological mechanisms of environmental pollutants contributing to GDM may involve insulin resistance, β-cell dysfunction, neurohormonal dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetic modification, and alterations in gut microbiome. In conclusion, long-term environmental pollutants exposure may induce the development of GDM, and there may be a synergistic effect between the homologs. However, studies conducted on the direct biological link between environmental pollutants and GDM were few. More prospective studies and high-quality in vivo and in vitro experiments were needed to investigate the specific effects and mechanisms. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introduction: Malacoplakia is a rare chronic inflammatory disease that commonly affects the urinary bladder, and it is characterized by the presence of large cells containing vacuoles known as Michaelis-Gutmann bodies. Case report: A 79-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department a poorly defined with symptoms of fever, dysuria, hematuria, and pain and swelling in her right knee. Microbiological studies indicated the presence of Escherichia coli in blood cultures, urine cultures, and synovial fluid cultures of the right knee. A computed tomography scan revealed nonspecific bladder thickening, which was further confirmed by a cystoscopy. A poorly defined lesion in the trigone was resected, and subsequent pathological examination revealed the presence of malacoplakia without evidence of malignancy. The patient was treated with antibiotic therapy, and the hematuria eventually resolved. Systematic review: We conducted a comprehensive search in the Medline, EMBASE, and WoS databases from January 1, 1993, to January 1, 2023, for articles that focused on Malacoplakia, involved human subjects. Were included 32 articles reporting on 35 cases of urinary bladder malacoplakia. The majority of those diagnosed with bladder malacoplakia were women under the age of 50, with recurrent urinary tract infections and immunosuppressive conditions as frequent comorbidities. Positive cultures showed Escherichia coli (E. coli) in 72% of cases. Successful outcomes were achieved in 26 cases (74.3%). Discussion: Malacoplakia is triggered by an inadequate immune system response to lower urinary tract infections. Diagnosis requires prior biopsies before resection or more aggressive treatments. Appropriate treatment of urinary tract infections with antibiotics targeted at gram-negative bacteria is essential for treating malacoplakia. © 2023 Sociedad Mexicana de Urologia.

	abstract = {Photocatalysis is considered as promising methodology for the removal of pesticides from wastewater given its cost-effective and environmental benignity. Pesticide toxicity and bioaccumulation have brought up environmental issues, underlining the necessity for efficient removal techniques based on novel nanomaterials. Herein, biochar (BC) synthesized by using waste peels of citrus limetta embedded with green synthesized Fe2O3 nanoparticle by using green tea extract. By using PXRD analysis, the α phase of Fe2O3 confirmed. Endosulfan (ES) and Ethion (ET) pesticides are degraded photocatalytically using a sequential, BC@ Fe2O3 nanohybrid. At the pollutant concentration (50 mg L−1), with catalytic dose (25 mg) in acidic condition under natural sunlight, BC@ Fe2O3 showed to be extremely effective in the breakdown of pesticides. The higher removal of pesticides by BC@ Fe2O3 supported by higher value of zeta potential (−22.5 mV), enhanced surface area (74 m2 g−1) and lower value of band gap (1.8 eV) as an effect of interactive characteristic and semiconducting behaviour. The fast decline in pesticide concentration followed by a gradual decrease demonstrated Ist order kinetics triggered by Langmuir adsorption. The availability of active species such as oxygen, hydroxyl radicals and holes, which are liable for pesticide breakdown, proved by scavenger analysis. Formation of safer metabolites during the photocatalytic studies confirmed by the LC-MS studies. Finally, modified BC@ Fe2O3 nanohybrid may prove to be a viable alternative catalyst for industrial applications due to their reusability (n=7), charge separation, stability and high surface activity. © 2023 Wiley-VCH GmbH.},

	abstract = {Sediments are habitats and major sources of nutrients for benthic organisms. High concentration of pollutants can impact negatively on the lives of such organisms and ultimately on the lives of human beings who may feed on them. This study was carried out in order to evaluate some environmental pollutants’ load: heavy metals and pesticide residues in Irintan, Omi-Eye and Egbigbu river sediments in Ekiti State, Southwest Nigeria. Sediment samples were taken at upper, middle and lower courses of each river relative to the farm used for the study. The samples were air-dried in the laboratory, disaggregated, sieved and analysed for heavy metals and organochlorine pesticides (OCP) residues using standard methods. The heavy metal range at floodplains (mg/kg) was: Cr (0.25-2.08), Cu (0.19-14.28), Zn (BDL-2.53), Cd (BDL-0.87), Pb (BDL-0.32), Fe (0.38-22.35) while for OCP residues, the range (µg/kg) was α-BHC (0.15-0.33), β-BHC (0.19-14.28), ẟ-BHC (0.25-1.09), lindane (BDL-1.23), chlorothalonil (0.87-1.44), heptachlor (BDL-1.04), heptachlor epoxide (BDL-1.96), endosulfan I (0.20-1.98), endosulfan II (BDL-0.67), aldrin (BDL-1.93), endrin (BDL-0.37), dieldrin (BDL-0.42), p,p-DDE (BDL-0.52), p,p-DDT (BDL-1.20), methoxychlor (0.21-0.88). The pollutants’ concentrations in the sediments were generally low at all the sites when compared with international guidelines for each pollutant. Governments in Nigeria should checkmate indiscriminate dumping of refuse most of which end in our rivers in order to reduce pollutants’ concentration in rivers/sediments so as to protect the lives of benthic organisms. © 2023 The Authors.},

	abstract = {Several per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been linked to metabolic disorders in organisms. However, few studies have considered their combined effects, which would be more representative of PFAS occurring in the environment. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a mixture of 18 PFAS at three environmentally relevant concentrations for 5 days to assess their bioconcentration and metabolic consequences. The burdens of ∑PFAS in zebrafish larvae were 0.12, 1.58, and 9.63 mg/kg in the 0.5, 5, and 50 μg/L treatment groups, respectively. Exposure to the PFAS mixture accelerated hatching and larval heart rates, increased energy expenditure, and reduced ATP levels and glucose contents due to decreased feed intake and glucose uptake. Metabolomic analysis revealed that exposure to the PFAS mixture enhanced glycolysis but inhibited phospholipid synthesis, and significantly increased the expression of lipid metabolism related genes (srebf1, acox, and pparα), which indicated enhanced β-oxidation. The significant changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial content, and the transcription of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (mfn2, ndufs1, atp5fa1, and mt-nd1) and mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription (18rs-rrn, and polg1) suggested that exposure to the PFAS mixture could cause mitochondrial dysfunction and further disrupt glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, ultimately causing metabolic disorders in zebrafish larvae. These findings demonstrate the importance of assessing the metabolic effects of PFAS mixtures on early development in wildlife and humans. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) is a short-chain perfluoroalkyl substance widely used to replace the banned perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) in different industrial and household products. It has currently been identified in the environment and human bodies; nonetheless, the possible toxicities are not well-known. Zebrafish have been used as a toxicant screening model due to their fast and transparent developmental processes. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PFHxS for five days, and various experiments were performed to monitor the developmental and cellular processes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/MS) analysis confirmed that PFHxS was absorbed and accumulated in the zebrafish embryos. We reported that 2.5 µM or higher PFHxS exposure induced phenotypic abnormalities, marked by developmental delay in the mid-hind brain boundary and yolk sac edema. Additionally, larvae exposed to PFHxS displayed facial malformation due to the reduction of neural crest cell expression. RNA sequencing analysis further identified 4643 differentiated expressed transcripts in 5 µM PFHxS-exposed 5-days post fertilization (5-dpf) larvae. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, as well as oxidative stress were enriched in the PFHxS-exposed larvae. To validate these findings, a series of biological experiments were conducted. PFHxS exposure led to a nearly 4-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, possibly due to hyperglycemia and impaired glutathione balance. The Oil Red O’ staining and qPCR analysis strengthens the notions that lipid metabolism was disrupted, leading to lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and malondialdehyde formation. All these alterations ultimately affected cell cycle events, resulting in S and G2/M cell cycle arrest. In conclusion, our study demonstrated that PFHxS could accumulate and induce various developmental toxicities in aquatic life, and such data might assist the government to accelerate the regulatory policy on PFHxS usage. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: There is a growing interest in understanding the health effects of exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) through the study of the human metabolome. In this systematic review, we aimed to identify consistent findings between PFAS and metabolomic signatures. We conducted a search matching specific keywords that was independently reviewed by two authors on two databases (EMBASE and PubMed) from their inception through July 19, 2022 following PRISMA guidelines. Recent Findings: We identified a total of 28 eligible observational studies that evaluated the associations between 31 different PFAS exposures and metabolomics in humans. The most common exposure evaluated was legacy long-chain PFAS. Population sample sizes ranged from 40 to 1,105 participants at different stages across the lifespan. A total of 19 studies used a non-targeted metabolomics approach, 7 used targeted approaches, and 2 included both. The majority of studies were cross-sectional (n = 25), including four with prospective analyses of PFAS measured prior to metabolomics. Summary: Most frequently reported associations across studies were observed between PFAS and amino acids, fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, phosphosphingolipids, bile acids, ceramides, purines, and acylcarnitines. Corresponding metabolic pathways were also altered, including lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, nucleotide, energy metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. We found consistent evidence across studies indicating PFAS-induced alterations in lipid and amino acid metabolites, which may be involved in energy and cell membrane disruption. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a typical perfluoroalkyl group compound, has received worldwide attention due to its significant environmental toxicity. Following regulatory bans on the production and emission of PFOA, concerns have been raised about the potential health risks and the safety of novel perfluoroalkyl analogues. HFPO-DA (trade name Gen-X) and HFPO-TA are two perfluoroalkyl analogues known to be bioaccumulative, whose level of toxicity and whether they are safe alternatives to PFOA remain unclear. In the following study, the physiological and metabolic effects of exposure to PFOA and its novel analogues were explored in zebrafish using 1/3 LC50 (PFOA 100 μM, Gen-X 200 μM, HFPO-TA 30 μM). At the same LC50 toxicological effect, exposure to PFOA and HFPO-TA resulted in abnormal phenotypes such as spinal curvature, pericardial edema and aberrant body length, while Gen-X was little changed. Metabolically, PFOA, HFPO-TA and Gen-X all significantly increased total cholesterol in exposed zebrafish with PFOA and HFPO-TA also increasing total triglyceride levels. Transcriptome analysis showed that the number of differentially expressed genes in PFOA, Gen-X, and HFPO-TA treated conditions compared to control groups were 527, 572, and 3, 933, respectively. KEGG and GO analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed pathways and functions related to lipid metabolism as well as significant activation of the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPARs) pathway. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis identified significant dysregulation in the downstream target genes of PPARα, which is responsible for lipid oxidative catabolism, and the SREBP pathway, which is responsible for lipid synthesis. In conclusion, both perfluoroalkyl analogues HFPO-TA and Gen-X exhibit significant physiological and metabolic toxicity to aquatic organisms and their environmental accumulation should be closely regulated. © 2023},

	abstract = {Heavy metal cations are a typical type of inorganic pollutant that has persistent distribution characteristics in aquatic environments and are easily adsorbed on carriers, posing serious threats to ecological safety and human health. Some studies have shown that the coexistence of dissolved organic matter (DOM) and microplastics (MPs) promotes the adsorption of heavy metal cations, but the mechanism of promoting the adsorption process has not been thoroughly studied. In this study, the effect of polystyrene microplastics (PSMPs) on the binding properties of Pb2+ onto humic acid (HA) in aquatic environments was investigated by spectral analysis and two-dimensional correlation (2D-COS) analysis. When PSMPs co-existed with HA, the adsorption capacity of Pb2+ increased. On the one hand, Pb2+ is directly adsorbed on HA through the mechanism of complexation reaction, ion exchange and electrostatic interaction. On the other hand, Pb2+ is first adsorbed on PSMPs by electrostatic action and indirectly adsorbed on HA in the form of PSMPs-Pb2+ owing to the interaction between HA and PSMPs, which increases the adsorption amount of Pb2+ on HA. This study is significant for studying the migration and regression of heavy metal cation contaminants when PSMPs co-exist with DOM in an aqueous environment. © 2023 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Water quality has recently emerged as one of the utmost severe ecological problems being faced by the developing countries all over the world, and Bangladesh is no exception. Both surface and groundwater sources contain different contaminants, which lead to numerous deaths due to water-borne diseases, particularly among children. This study presents one of the most comprehensive reviews on the current status of water quality in Bangladesh with a special emphasis on both conventional pollutants and emerging contaminants. Data show that urban rivers in Bangladesh are in a critical condition, especially Korotoa, Teesta, Rupsha, Pashur, and Padma. The Buriganga River and few locations in the Turag, Balu, Sitalakhya, and Karnaphuli rivers have dissolvable oxygen (DO) levels of almost zero. Many waterways contain traces of NO3, NO2, and PO4−3 pollutants. The majority of the rivers in Bangladesh also have Zn, Cu, Fe, Pb, Cd, Ni, Mn, As, and Cr concentrations that exceed the WHO permissible limits for safe drinking water, while their metal concentrations exceed the safety threshold for irrigation. Mercury poses the greatest hazard with 90.91% of the samples falling into the highest risk category. Mercury is followed by zinc 57.53% and copper 29.16% in terms of the dangers they pose to public health and the ecosystem. Results show that a considerable percentage of the population is at risk, being exposed to contaminated water. Despite hundreds of cryptosporidiosis cases reported, fecal contamination, i.e., Cryptosporidium, is totally ignored and need serious considerations to be regularly monitored in source water. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Exposure to perfluoroalkyl substances may affect offspring immune development and thereby increase risk of childhood asthma, but the underlying mechanisms and asthma phenotype affected by such exposure is unknown. Methods: In the Danish COPSAC2010 cohort of 738 unselected pregnant women and their children plasma PFOS and PFOA concentrations were semi-quantified by untargeted metabolomics analyses and calibrated using a targeted pipeline in mothers (gestation week 24 and 1 week postpartum) and children (age ½, 1½ and 6 years). We examined associations between pregnancy and childhood PFOS and PFOA exposure and childhood infections, asthma, allergic sensitization, atopic dermatitis, and lung function measures, and studied potential mechanisms by integrating data on systemic low-grade inflammation (hs-CRP), functional immune responses, and epigenetics. Findings: Higher maternal PFOS and PFOA exposure during pregnancy showed association with a non-atopic asthma phenotype by age 6, a protection against sensitization, and no association with atopic asthma or lung function, or atopic dermatitis. The effect was primarily driven by prenatal exposure. There was no association with infection proneness, low-grade inflammation, altered immune responses or epigenetic changes. Interpretations: Prenatal exposure to PFOS and PFOA, but not childhood exposure, specifically increased the risk of low prevalent non-atopic asthma, whereas there was no effect on atopic asthma, lung function, or atopic dermatitis.

Four databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Medline before 20 September 2022 were systematically searched. A fixed-effect model was used to estimate the change in infant birth weight (g) associated with PFAS concentrations increasing by 10-fold. Dose-response meta-analyses were also conducted when possible. The study follows the guidelines of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA). A total of 21 studies were included. Among these studies, 18 studies examined the associations between PFOA and birth weight, 17 studies reported PFOS, and 11 studies discussed PFHxS. Associations between PFHxS (ES = −5.67, 95% CI: −33.92 to 22.59, P = 0.694) were weaker than those for PFOA and PFOS (ES = −58.62, 95% CI: −85.23 to −32.01, P < 0.001 for PFOA; ES = −54.75, 95% CI: −84.48 to −25.02, P < 0.001 for PFOS). The association was significantly stronger in the high median PFOS concentration group (ES = −107.23, 95% CI: −171.07 to −43.39, P < 0.001) than the lower one (ES = −29.15, 95% CI: −63.60 to −5.30, P = 0.097; meta-regression, P = 0.045). Limited evidence of a dose-response relationship was found. This study showed negative associations between maternal exposure to PFASs and infant birth weight. Limited evidence of a dose-response relationship between exposure to PFOS and infant birth weight was found.

	abstract = {As it is well known, the gut is one of the primary sites in any host for xenobiotics, and the many microbial metabolites responsible for the interactions between the gut microbiome and the host. However, there is a growing concern about the negative impacts on human health induced by toxic xenobiotics. Metabolomics, broadly including lipidomics, is an emerging approach to studying thousands of metabolites in parallel. In this review, we summarized recent advancements in mass spectrometry (MS) technologies in metabolomics. In addition, we reviewed recent applications of MS-based metabolomics for the investigation of toxic effects of xenobiotics on microbial and host metabolism. It was demonstrated that metabolomics, gut microbiome profiling, and their combination have a high potential to identify metabolic and microbial markers of xenobiotic exposure and determine its mechanism. Further, there is increasing evidence supporting that reprogramming the gut microbiome could be a promising approach to the intervention of xenobiotic toxicity. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Coroners, who hold inquests to determine the causes of unnatural deaths in England and Wales, having recognised factors that could cause other deaths, are legally obliged to signal concerns by sending ‘Reports to Prevent Future Deaths’ (PFDs) to interested persons. We aimed to establish whether Coroners’ concerns about medications are widely recognised. Methods: We searched MEDLINE, Embase and Web of Science up to 30 November, 2022 for publications linking PFDs and medications using a combination of search terms “coroner*”, “inquest*”, “medicine*”, “medication*” and “prevent*”. We also searched the BMJ, a UK journal that carries news items; and the databases Nexis Advance and News On the Web for reports in national newspapers between 2013 and 2022, using the search terms (“regulation 28” OR “prevent future deaths” OR “prevention of future deaths”) AND “coroner”. We recorded the number of publications, as well as their citations in Google Scholar at 23 May, 2023. Results: Only 11 published papers on medicines referenced UK PFDs, nine of which were from our group. The BMJ carried 23 articles mentioning PFDs, five related to medicines. Of 139 PFDs (out of over 4000) mentioned in national newspapers, only nine related to medicines. Conclusions: The PFDs related to medicines are not widely referred to in medical journals or UK national newspapers. By contrast, the Australian and New Zealand National Coronial Information System has contributed cases to 206 publications cited in PubMed, of which 139 are related to medicines. Our search suggests that information from English and Welsh Coroners’ PFDs is under-recognised, even though it should inform public health. The results of inquiries by Coroners and medical examiners worldwide into potentially preventable deaths involving medicines should be used to strengthen the safety of medicines. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

Despite trace-level contaminants，they still pose a significant threat to water quality and human health. As a pretreatment process for improving drinking water quality，the riverbank filtration system has been proven natural，reliable，and low-cost for effectively eliminating the ECs existed in rivers. This study systematically reviews typical ECs，including their sources，fate，degradation transformation mechanisms，and interactions with the surrounding environment. The study highlights the typical degradation mechanisms of ECs in riverbank filtration systems，particularly the biodegradation mechanisms. Specifically，the removal process of ECs by biodegradation in riverbank filtration systems and corresponding influencing factors are summarized. New research directions for biodegradation of ECs in riverbank filtration systems are proposed.

	abstract = {The main component of chocolate, cocoa (Theobroma cacao), is a significant commercial agricultural plant that directly sustains the livelihoods of an estimated forty to fifty million people. The economies of many cocoa producing nations, particularly those in the developing world, are supported by cocoa export revenue. To ensure satisfactory yields, however, the plant is usually intensely treated with pesticides because it is vulnerable to disease and pest attacks. Even though pesticides help protect the cocoa plant, unintended environmental contamination is also likely. Honey, produced from nectar obtained by honeybees from flowers while foraging, can serve as a good indicator for the level of pesticide residues and environmental pesticide build-up in landscapes. Here, we use a systematic literature review to quantify the extent of research on residues of pesticides used in cocoa cultivation in honey. In 81% of the 104 studies examined for this analysis, 169 distinct compounds were detected. Imidacloprid was the most frequently detected pesticide, making neonicotinoids the most frequently found class of pesticides overall. However, in cocoa producing countries, organophosphates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids were the most frequently detected pesticides. Interestingly, only 19% of studies were carried out in cocoa producing countries. We recommend prioritizing more research in the countries that produce cocoa to help to understand the potential impact of pesticide residues linked with cocoa cultivation in honey and the environment more generally to inform better pesticide usage, human health, and environmental policies. © 2023 Boakye et al.

	abstract = {Rhodococcus opacus is a bacterium that has a high tolerance to aromatic compounds and can produce significant amounts of triacylglycerol (TAG). Here, we present iGR1773, the first genome-scale model (GSM) of R. opacus PD630 metabolism based on its genomic sequence and associated data. The model includes 1773 genes, 3025 reactions, and 1956 metabolites, was developed in a reproducible manner using CarveMe, and was evaluated through Metabolic Model tests (MEMOTE). We combine the model with two Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods that use transcriptomics data to predict growth rates and fluxes: E-Flux2 and SPOT (Simplified Pearson Correlation with Transcriptomic data). Growth rates are best predicted by E-Flux2. Flux profiles are more accurately predicted by E-Flux2 than flux balance analysis (FBA) and parsimonious FBA (pFBA), when compared to 44 central carbon fluxes measured by 13C-Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C-MFA). Under glucose-fed conditions, E-Flux2 presents an R2 value of 0.54, while predictions based on pFBA had an inferior R2 of 0.28. We attribute this improved performance to the extra activity information provided by the transcriptomics data. For phenol-fed metabolism, in which the substrate first enters the TCA cycle, E-Flux2's flux predictions display a high R2 of 0.96 while pFBA showed an R2 of 0.93. We also show that glucose metabolism and phenol metabolism function with similar relative ATP maintenance costs. These findings demonstrate that iGR1773 can help the metabolic engineering community predict aromatic substrate utilization patterns and perform computational strain design.  © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

The results showed that; (L)of the 12 functional traits studied, seven were found to be vulnerable in fish; the order of toxicity response was malformation (In RR = - 2.559 9), development (In RR = - 0.410 3), cell damage (In RR = - 0. 396 2), reproduction (In RR = - 0.372 4), thyroid response (In RR = - 0.249 2), growth (lnRR = -0.2194), and survival (In RR = -0.2192).

PFASs occur in edible oil, an important component of the global diet, mainly in three ways: raw material contamination, process contamination, and migration from oil contact materials. Thus, the occurrence of PFAS in edible oils has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this work, the pertinent literature of the last two decades from the Web of Science database was researched. This review systematically addressed the potential sources, the contamination levels, and the progress of the determination of PFASs in edible oil. It aims to provide a relatively whole profile of PFASs in edible oil, render assistance to minimise human exposure to PFASs, and standardise the detection methods of perfluoroalkyl substances in edible oil. © 2023 by the authors.},

Three classes of ePFASs, namely chlorinated polyfluoroalkylether sulfonic acids, hexafluoropropylene oxide homologues and short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids attracted the most attention. It is, therefore, the goal of this review to systematically and critically analyse the toxicity and toxicological mechanisms of these ePFASs based on the papers published between 2017 and 2022. The review summarized the main findings from both in vivo and in vitro studies, covering the hepatotoxicity of ePFASs and their interference with the endocrine system, including reproductive, developmental and thyroid toxicity. It also summarized the changes in gene expression in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis of the model organisms after ePFASs exposure. The changes in gene expression in vitro and in vivo provide a clearer understanding of the toxicological mechanisms of ePFASs interference on hormonal levels (i.e., estradiol, testosterone, and thyroid hormones), developmental disturbance (e.g., swim bladder dysfunction) and lipid metabolism disruption (e.g., lipid droplet accumulation and hepatomegaly). In the end, future research directions on the toxicological mechanisms of ePFASs are suggested. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Industrial processes result in the production of heavy metals, dyes, pesticides, polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals, micropollutants, and PFAS (per- and polyfluorinated substances). Heavy metals are currently a significant problem in drinking water and other natural water bodies, including soil, which has an adverse impact on the environment as a whole. The heavy metal is highly poisonous, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and teratogenic to humans as well as other animals. Multiple polluted sites, including terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, have been observed to co-occur with heavy metals and organo-pollutants. Pesticides and heavy metals can be degraded and removed concurrently from various metals and pesticide-contaminated matrixes due to microbial processes that include a variety of bacteria, both aerobic and anaerobic, as well as fungi. Numerous studies have examined the removal of heavy metals and organic-pollutants from different types of systems, but none of them have addressed the removal of these co-occurring heavy metals and organic pollutants and the use of microbes to do so. Therefore, the main focus of this review is on the recent developments in the concurrent microbial degradation of organo-pollutants and heavy metal removal. The limitations related to the simultaneous removal and degradation of heavy metals and organo-pollutant pollutants have also been taken into account. © 2023 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {Background: To critically evaluate the effects of different nursing measures based on the concept of fast-track surgery (FTS) on the negative emotions of patients with breast cancer. Methods: A systematic search of 8 databases, namely PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, Psycho info, China national knowledge infrastructure, Wanfang, China science and technology journal database, and China biomedical literature database, was performed to find randomized controlled trials from inception to April 2023. Two reviewers critically and independently assessed the risk of bias using Cochrane Collaboration criteria and extracted correlated data using the designed form. All analyses were performed with Review Manager 5.3. Results: Ten studies were included in the systematic review, with a total of 830 patients (FTS group: 415; control group: 415). The results showed that different nursing measures based on the concept of FTS could significantly reduce anxiety (MD = -1.74, 95% confidence intervals [-2.41, -1.08], P <.00001) and depression (MD = -1.98, 95% confidence intervals [-2.44, -1.51], P <.00001) in patients after modified breast cancer surgery compared with the control group. Conclusions: Based on the concept of FTS, the nursing measures such as reducing preoperative fasting time, posture management, preventive analgesia, and early functional exercise can effectively reduce the anxiety and depression of patients during the perioperative period. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {As the most commonly used organochlorine pesticide nowadays, chlorothalonil (CHI), is ubiquitous in a natural environment and poses many adverse effects to organisms. Unfortunately, the toxicity mechanisms of CHI have not been clarified yet. This study found that the CHI based on ADI level could induce obesity in mice. In addition, CHI could induce an imbalance in the gut microbiota of mice. Furthermore, the results of the antibiotic treatment and gut microbiota transplantation experiments showed that the CHI could induce obesity in mice in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Based on the results of targeted metabolomics and gene expression analysis, CHI could disturb the bile acids (BAs) metabolism of mice, causing the inhibition of the signal response of BAs receptor FXR and leading to glycolipid metabolism disorders in liver and epiWAT of mice. The administration of FXR agonist GW4064 and CDCA could significantly improve the CHI-induced obesity in mice. In conclusion, CHI was found to induce obesity in mice by regulating the gut microbiota and BAs metabolism via the FXR signaling pathway. This study provides evidence linking the gut microbiota and pesticides exposure with the progression of obesity, demonstrating the key role of gut microbiota in the toxic effects of pesticides. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

Adsorption attracts great attention as a cost-effective technique for the remediation of contaminated water. Despite a broad variety of adsorbents existing in the literature, agriculture waste-derived biosorbents appear to hold the greatest promise for the adsorption of emerging contaminants. Herein, this review introduces the recent developments of biosorbents in the adsorption field. The role of biosorbents in the green chemistry principle and their contribution towards Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are discussed. Different types of modifications of biosorbents including activation and modification of magnetic, non-magnetic nanoparticles and polymers are systematically reviewed. Besides, the application of modified biosorbents in the adsorption of heavy metals, dyes, PAHs and oils along with their respective mechanisms are analyzed. Apart from this, the potential practical application of biosorbents is canvassed through introducing simultaneous adsorption of pollutants, usage of real industrial wastewater matrix and reusability performance. Finally, the recommendations for future adsorption studies are presented. This review is anticipated to critically review and explore the potential of biosorbents as economical and green candidates for the adsorption of emerging pollutants. © 2023 The Authors},

Because of their remarkable properties, such as tunable surface plasmon resonance characteristics and high surface areas, bio-synthesised nanomaterials are receiving more scientific and academic attention for their use in various application sectors, especially as catalysts in environmental remediation. Green synthesized nanomaterial's can efficiently contribute to the degradation of a wide range of organic pollutants, including dyes, into harmless by-products. These particles have a cure for recalcitrant organic and inorganic pollutants due to their photocatalytic properties, which largely depend on the production of reactive oxygen species under sunlight or UV illumination. This comprehensive review systematically covers up-to-date knowledge on recent developments in the green synthesis of nanoparticles and composites using plants and microorganisms, unravels underlying mechanisms, and highlights their application areas. It then provides detailed information on their applications in the degradation of potentially toxic organic dyes and the removal of other emerging pollutants, including heavy metals and antibiotics.

	abstract = {Malaria is a serious mosquito-borne tropical disease impacting populations in tropical regions across the world. Malaria was previously hyperendemic in Hainan Province. Due to large-scale anti-malarial intervention, malaria elimination in the province was achieved in 2019. This paper reviews the literature on the ecology, bionomics, and control of malaria vectors in Hainan from 1951 to 2021. We searched PubMed, and the China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI) database for relevant articles published and included three other important books published in Chinese or English in order to summarize research on species, distribution, vectorial capacity, ecology, the resistance of malaria vectors to insecticides, and malaria vector control in Hainan Province. A total of 239 references were identified, 79 of which met the criteria for inclusion in our review. A total of six references dealt with the salivary gland infection of Anophelines, six with vectorial capacity, 41 with mosquito species and distribution, seven with seasonality, three with blood preference, four with nocturnal activity, two with flight distance, 13 with resistance to insecticides, and 14 with vector control. Only 16 published papers met the criteria of addressing malaria vectors in Hainan over the last 10 years (2012–2021). Anopheles dirus and Anopheles minimus are primary malaria vectors, mainly distributed in the southern and central areas of Hainan. Indoor residual spraying with DDT and the use of ITNs with pyrethroid insecticides were the main interventions taken for malaria control. Previous studies on ecology, bionomics, and resistance of vectors provided scientific evidence for optimizing malaria vector control and contributed to malaria elimination in Hainan Province. We hope our study will contribute to preventing malaria reestablishment caused by imported malaria in Hainan. Research on malaria vectors should be updated to provide scientific evidence for malaria vector control strategies post-elimination as the ecology, bionomics, and resistance of vectors to insecticides may change with changes in the environment. © 2023 by the authors.},

The challenge is to identify the potential for recovering value from this waste stream for different supply chains when there are diverse definitions in the field. The urban mining approach employs recycling and circular solutions inspired by principles such as industrial metabolism, industrial ecology, and the circular economy. This study presents a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature on urban mining and a comprehensive analysis of the many definitions of value recovery. This includes the stages of e-waste urban mining, the value recovery potential according to circular economy principles, location, and critical raw materials (CRMs). The results suggest that the exploitation of anthropogenic urban mines depends on Waste-to-Resources (WtR) and Waste-to-Energy (WtE) ratios, and the techniques borrowed from conventional mining. We highlight the importance of e-waste as a secondary source of CRMs (e.g., Au, Ag, Cu, Li, and Co), and provide recommendations regarding the critical analysis of the potential of urban mining to mitigate the impact of e-waste through circular processes and value recovery.

	abstract = {Perfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous environmental contaminants that are widely used in consumer products and fire suppression foams. The presence of PFAS in ground and surface water can create a route for PFAS to enter the soil, exposing ecosystems (including agroecosystems), where they will move through the food web via biomagnification. The toxicity of PFAS to plants, particularly in agricultural ecosystems, is of emerging concern due to the application of biosolids that are often contaminated with PFAS. Nevertheless, due to the low concentrations of PFAS in most agricultural soils, the direct impact of PFAS on plant health is not well understood. We used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to explore the effects of exposure of two key PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism. We found that Arabidopsis exhibited an accumulation of multiple metabolites, including soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose), multiple amino acids, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, suggesting that PFAS exposure impacts the metabolism of plants by causing an accumulation of stress-related amino acids and soluble sugars that drives increased activity of the TCA cycle. The present study shows that 1H-NMR metabolomics is a viable tool for investigating changes in the metabolic profile of plants exposed to PFAS and can be used to illuminate the stress response of plants in a high-throughput, nonbiased manner.

	abstract = {Brazil is the third largest exporter of fruits and vegetables in the world and, consequently, uses large amounts of pesticides. Food contamination with pesticide residues (PRs) is a serious concern, especially in developing countries. Several research reports revealed that some Brazilian farmers spray pesticides on fruits and vegetables in large quantities, generating PRs after harvest. Thus, ingestion of food contaminated with PRs can cause adverse health effects. Based on information obtained through a systematic review of essential information from 33 articles, we studied the assessment of potential health risks associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in children and adults from Brazilian states. This study identified 111 PRs belonging to different chemical groups, mainly organophosphates and organochlorines, in 26 fruit and vegetable samples consumed and exported by Brazil. Sixteen of these PRs were above the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) established by local and international legislation. We did not identify severe acute and chronic dietary risks, but the highest risk values were observed in São Paulo and Santa Catarina, associated with the consumption of tomatoes and sweet peppers due to the high concentrations of organophosphates. A high long-term health risk is associated with the consumption of oranges in São Paulo and grapes in Bahia due to chlorothalonil and procymidone. We also identified that 26 PRs are considered carcinogenic by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), and the carcinogenic risk analysis revealed no severe risk in any Brazilian state investigated due to the cumulative hazard index (HI) < 1. However, the highest HI values were in São Paulo due to acephate and carbaryl in sweet pepper and in Bahia due to dichlorvos. This information can help regulatory authorities define new guidelines for pesticide residue limits in fruits and vegetables commonly consumed and exported from Brazil and monitor the quality of commercial formulations. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Given that human biomonitoring surveys show per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) to be ubiquitous, humans can be exposed to PFAS through various sources, including drinking water, food, and indoor environmental media. Data on the nature and level of PFAS in residential environments are required to identify important pathways for human exposure. This work investigated important pathways of exposure to PFAS by reviewing, curating, and mapping evidence for the measured occurrence of PFAS in exposure media. Real-world occurrence for 20 PFAS was targeted primarily in media commonly related to human exposure (outdoor and indoor air, indoor dust, drinking water, food, food packaging, articles, and products, and soil). A systematic-mapping process was implemented to conduct title-abstract and full-text screening and to extract PECO-relevant primary data into comprehensive evidence databases. Parameters of interest included the following: sampling dates and locations, numbers of collection sites and participants, detection frequencies, and occurrence statistics. Detailed data were extracted on PFAS occurrence in indoor and environmental media from 229 references and on PFAS occurrence in human matrices where available from those references. Studies of PFAS occurrence became numerous after 2005. Studies were most abundant for PFOA (80% of the references) and PFOS (77%). Many studies analyzed additional PFAS, particularly, PFNA and PFHxS (60% of references each). Food (38%) and drinking water (23%) were the commonly studied media. Most studies found detectable levels of PFAS, and detectable levels were reported in a majority of states in the United States. Half or more of the limited studies for indoor air and products detected PFAS in 50% or more of the collected samples. The resulting databases can inform problem formulation for systematic reviews to address specific PFAS exposure queries and questions, support prioritization of PFAS sampling, and inform PFAS exposure measurement studies. The search strategy should be extended and implemented to support living evidence review in this rapidly advancing area. Not subject to U.S. Copyright. Published 2023 by American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Because of the high production rates, low recycling rates, and poor waste management of plastics, an increasing amount of plastic is entering the aquatic environment, where it can provide new ecological niches for microbial communities and form a so-called plastisphere. Recent studies have focused on the one-way impact of plastic substrata or biofilm communities. However, our understanding of the two-way interactions between plastics and biofilms is still limited. This review first summarizes the formation process and the co-occurrence network analysis of the aquatic plastisphere to comprehensively illustrate the succession pattern of biofilm communities and the potential consistency between keystone taxa and specific environmental behavior of the plastisphere. Furthermore, this review sheds light on mutual interactions between plastics and biofilms. Plastic properties, environmental conditions, and colonization time affect biofilm development. Meanwhile, the biofilm communities, in turn, influence the environmental behaviors of plastics, including transport, contaminant accumulation, and especially the fragmentation and degradation of plastics. Based on a systematic literature review and cross-referencing from these disciplines, the current research focus, and future challenges in exploring aquatic plastisphere development and biofilm-plastic interactions are proposed. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Although dicofol has been widely banned all over the world as a kind of organochlorine contaminant, it still exists in the environment. This study developed a high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS) detection technique for dicofol, an environmental pollutant, for the first time using in-source fragmentation. The results confirmed that m/z 251 was the only precursor ion of dicofol after in-source fragmentation, and m/z 139 and m/z 111 were reasonable product ions. The main factors triggering the in-source fragmentation were the H+ content and solution conductivity when dicofol entered the mass spectrometer. Density functional theory can be used to analyze and interpret the mechanism of dicofol fragmentation reaction in ESI source. Dicofol reduced the molecular energy from 8.8 ± 0.05 kcal/mol to 1.0 ± 0.05 kcal/mol, indicating that the internal energy release from high to low was the key driving force of in-source fragmentation. A method based on HPLC-MS/MS was developed to analyze dicofol residues in environmental water. The LOQ was 0.1 μg/L, which was better than the previous GC or GC-MS methods. This study not only proposed an HPLC-MS/MS analysis method for dicofol for the first time but also explained the in-source fragmentation mechanism of compounds in ESI source, which has positive significance for the study of compounds with unconventional mass spectrometry behavior in the field of organic pollutant analysis and metabonomics. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {The negative effects of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on biological nitrogen removal performance in wastewater treatment plants, are receiving increasing attention due to the widespread reporting of this issue. In this study, pomelo peel iron-loaded biochar (Fe-PBC) was added to an anammox bioreactor to alleviate the negative effects of PFOA. Results showed that the addition of Fe-PBC increased the ammonia and nitrite removal efficiencies from 77.7 ± 9.6 % and 79.5 ± 5.6 % to 94.45 ± 5.1 % and 95.9 ± 5.0 %, respectively. In addition, Fe-PBC promoted the removal of PFOA from wastewater, increasing the PFOA removal efficiency from 5.2 % to 29.2 ± 4.3 % from 100 to 200 days. The introduction of iron-loaded biochar into the anammox bioreactor increased the C[sbnd]O ratio by 13.64 % by 150 days. In addition, a C[dbnd]O fitting peak was detected in the Fe-PBC, indicating that the Fe-PBC was loaded with microorganisms. Microbial community analysis showed a decrease in the relative abundances of Proteobacteria and Nitrospirae from 31 % and 3.4 % to 16.8 % and 0.9 %, respectively, while the relative abundance of Planctomycetes increased from 26.8 % to 44.1 %. Metagenomic analysis found that the functional genes hzsB and hdh increased from 98,666 ± 11,400 and 3190 ± 460 to 119,333 ± 15,534 and 138,650 ± 11,233 copy numbers/MLSS. The increase in anammox biomass may be attributed to the presence of iron, an essential element for the synthesis of key anammox enzyme. Furthermore, iron was also associated with the enhanced extracellular electron transfer in the anammox system induced by Fe-PBC. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid is an artificial and non-degradable chemical. It is widely used due to its stable nature. It can enter the human body through food, drinking water, inhalation of household dust and contact with products containing perfluorooctanoic acid. It accumulates in the human body, causing potential harmful effects on human health. Based on the biodegradability and bioaccumulation of perfluorooctanoic acid in the human body, there are increasing concerns about the adverse effects of perfluorooctanoic acid exposure on kidneys. Research shows that kidney is the main accumulation organ of Perfluorooctanoic acid, and Perfluorooctanoic acid can cause nephrotoxicity and produce adverse effects on kidney function, but the exact mechanism is still unknown. In this review, we summarize the relationship between Perfluorooctanoic acid exposure and kidney health, evaluate risks more clearly, and provide a theoretical basis for subsequent research.

	abstract = {Insulin infusion sets (IISs) are an integral and intricate part of continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion for subjects with type 1 diabetes, infusing insulin from pump to the subcutaneous space. Insulin infusion sets interface with the skin surface, the dermis, and the subcutaneous space and may be the cause of infusion failure due to biological events or mechanical problems. Novel IISs with extended wear time and anti-inflammatory properties to mitigate these issues are described in the literature although material-tissue interactions are poorly understood. This rapid review focuses on the impact of IIS materials and designs on the subcutaneous response in people with diabetes and includes literature identified in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Twenty-one studies were identified for qualitative synthesis that encompassed a limited and heterogenic body of evidence including 10 clinical reports, six reviews, one case report, two abstracts, and two communications. Two clinical reports were randomized crossover studies. Reports on materials mostly compared steel versus polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) cannulas and suggested no substantial difference in tissue response to these materials. Reports on designs focused mostly on the angle of cannula insertion. To drive and improve research on extended wear and nonimmunogenic IISs, future studies should focus on material-tissue interaction as dedicated outcome measures, quantified with punch biopsy and imaging techniques such as ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and confocal reflectance microscopy. Original studies are required to further a field too young for a systematic meta-analysis. © 2022 Diabetes Technology Society.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance is a major global public health concern. Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that has emerged as a global threat because of its high levels of resistance to many antibiotics, particularly those considered as last-resort antibiotics, such as carbapenems. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) play an important role in the dissemination and expression of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including the mobilization of ARGs within and between species. We conducted an in-depth, systematic investigation of the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs associated with MGEs in A. baumannii. We focused on a cross-sectoral approach that integrates humans, animals, and environments. Four strategies for the prevention of ARG dissemination through MGEs have been discussed: prevention of airborne transmission of ARGs using semi-permeable membrane-covered thermophilic composting; application of nanomaterials for the removal of emerging pollutants (antibiotics) and pathogens; tertiary treatment technologies for controlling ARGs and MGEs in wastewater treatment plants; and the removal of ARGs by advanced oxidation techniques. This review contemplates and evaluates the major drivers involved in the transmission of ARGs from the cross-sectoral perspective and ARG-transfer prevention processes. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Based on a systematic review and meta-analysis of articles published in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science, we identified nine articles that provide evidence of the relationship between persistent organic pollutants and hyperuricemia. Our researchers assess the quality of the included studies and their risk of bias using the recommended method and tool. This study uses meta-analyses of the random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that the risk of hyperuricemia was strongly associated with three perfluorinated compounds, PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS, with the OR(95%CI) of 1.26 (1.07–1.47), 1.44(1.15–1.79), and 1.23(1.01–1.50) respectively. We also found a weak association between two other perfluorinated compounds, PFDA and PFHxS. Other than that, the summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident hyperuricemia were 2.34 (1.79–3.08) for DDT, 3.25(2.40–4.39) for DDE, 2.57 (1.37–4.81) for PCBs and 3.05(2.22–4.19) in trans-nonanchlor. Therefore, DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, PCBs, and trans-nonanchlor have also been linked with an increased risk of hyperuricemia in humans. This study finds that persistent organic pollutant is a critical factor for hyperuricemia, and further studies in specific regions will be considered in the future. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Objective To evaluate the effect of enhanced recovery after surgery(ERAS)in postoperative period of children with Hirschsprung disease(HD). Methods The databases of Pub Med, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, China National Knowledge Internet(CNKI), Wanfang Data and VIP were searched for published prospective clinical controlled trials on comparing ERAS versus traditional treatment in perioperative period of HD children until January 2022. Search terms were entered manually and searched by free combination. Chinese terms included rapid recovery, accelerated recovery, Hirschsprung disease, pediatrics and children, etc. And English terms included enhanced recovery after surgery, ERAS, fast track surgery, FTS, HD, Hirschsprung, infant and child, etc. Meta-analysis was performed with Rev Man5. 2 software. Results A total of 8 clinical controlled trials with 571 children were included. Experimental(n=297)and control(n=274)groups were assigned. Meta-analysis indicated that total length of stay[WMD=-3. 26, 95%CI(-4. 65, -1. 8), P<0. 001], postoperative length of stay[WMD=-6. 76, 95%CI(-10. 02, -3. 50), P<0. 01], postoperative exhaust time[WMD=-8. 86, 95%CI(-11. 69, -6. 02), P<0. 001]and postoperative defecation time[WMD=-5. 40, 95%CI(-9. 09, -1. 70), P=0. 004]were shorter in ERAS group than those in traditional treatment group. There were statistically significant differences. However, no statistically significant difference existed in complication rate[OR=0. 25, 95%CI(0. 04, 1. 72), P>0. 05]. Conclusions As compared with traditional treatment, rapid rehabilitation surgery can promote the recovery of gastrointestinal function and shorten length of hospital stay in HD children. However, a higher level of evidence-based evidence is required for confirmation. © 2023 Chinese Journal of Pediatric Surgery. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Low back pain is an extremely common condition with severe consequences. Among its potential specific causes, degenerative disc disease (DDD) is one of the most frequently observed. Mechanobiology is an emerging science studying the interplay between mechanical stimuli and the biological behavior of cells and tissues. The aim of the presented study is to review, with a systematic approach, the existing literature regarding the mechanobiology of the human intervertebral disc (IVD), define the main pathways involved in DDD and identify novel potential therapeutic targets. The review was carried out in accordance with the Preferential Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Studies were included if they described biological responses of human IVD cells under mechanical stimulation or alterations of mechanical properties of the IVD determined by different gene expression. Fifteen studies were included and showed promising results confirming the mechanobiology of the human IVD as a key element in DDD. The technical advances of the last decade have allowed us to increase our understanding of this topic, enabling us to identify possible therapeutic targets to treat and to prevent DDD. Further research and technological innovations will shed light on the interactions between the mechanics and biology of the human IVD. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As alternatives of long-chain PFASs (Poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances), perfluoroalkyl phosphinic acids (PFPiAs) are increasingly observed in the environment, but their environmental behaviors have not been well understood. Here, the microbial biotransformation of C6/C6 and C8/C8 PFPiA in two soils (Soil N and Y) was investigated. After 252 d and 330 d of incubation with PFPiAs in Soil N and Y respectively, the levels of PFPiAs decreased distinctly, accompanied by the increasing perfluorohexaphosphonic acid (PFHxPA) or perfluorooctanophosphonic acid (PFOPA) formation, magnifying PFPiAs were susceptible to C-P cleavage, which was also confirmed by the density functional theory calculations. The half-lives of the PFPiAs were longer than one year, while generally shorter in Soil N than in Soil Y and that of C6/C6 was shorter than C8/C8 PFPiA (392 d and 746 d in Soil N, and 603 and 1155 d in Soil Y, respectively). Metagenomic sequencing analysis revealed that Proteobacteria as the primary host of the potential functional genes related to C[sbnd]P bond cleavage might be the crucial phyla contributing to the biotransformation of PFPiAs. Meanwhile, the more intensive interactions between the microbes in Soil N consistently contribute to its greater capacity for transforming PFPiAs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The massive use of zinc pyrithione (ZPT, as broad-spectrum bactericides) resulted in its high levels in waste activated sludge (WAS) and affected subsequent WAS treatment. This work revealed the effects of ZPT on the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during WAS anaerobic digestion, in which VFAs yield was enhanced by approximately 6-9 folds (from 353 mg COD/L in control to 2526-3318 mg COD/L with low level of ZPT (20-50 mg/g TSS)). The ZPT occurred in WAS enabled the acceleration of solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification processes while inhibited the methanogenesis. Also, the low ZPT contributed to the enrichment of functional hydrolytic-acidifying microorganisms (e.g., Ottowia and Acinetobacter) but caused the reduction of methanogens (e.g., Methanomassiliicoccus and Methanothrix). Meta-transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the critical genes relevant to extracellular hydrolysis (i.e. CLPP and ZapA), membrane transport (i.e. gltI, and gltL), substrates metabolisms (i.e. fadj, and acd), and VFAs biosynthesis (i.e. porB and porD) were all upregulated by 25.1-701.3% with low level of ZPT. Specifically, the ZPT stimulus on amino acids metabolism for VFAs transformation was prominent over carbohydrates. Moreover, the functional species enabled to regulate the genes in QS and TCS systems to maintain favorable cell chemotaxis to adapt the ZPT stress. The cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance pathway was upregulated to blunt ZPT with the secretion of more lipopolysaccharide and activate proton pumps to maintain ions homeostasis to antagonize the ZPT toxicity for high microbial activities, the abundance of related genes was up-regulated by 60.5 to 524.5%. This work enlightened environmental behaviors of emerging pollutants on WAS anaerobic digestion process with interrelations of microbial metabolic regulation and adaptive responses. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Benzophenone-3 (BP-3) as one of frequently used organic UV filters has been considered an emerging pollutant due to its toxicities. Benzophenone-8 (BP-8) is one of the main metabolites of BP-3 in organisms. Current reports show that BP-8 may be more toxic than BP-3. However, difference of their toxicities on embryonic development has rarely been reported. In this study, zebrafish embryos were chosen as the target organism to explore the developmental toxicities of BP-3 and BP-8. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis was performed to compare their modes of action. Results showed that BP-8 exposures led to higher bioaccumulation and lower hatching rate of zebrafish larvae than BP-3. Both BP-8 and BP-3 exposures caused behavioral abnormalities of zebrafish larvae, but no significant difference was found between them. At the metabolome level, 1 μg/L BP-3 and 1 μg/L BP-8 exposures altered neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and FoxO signaling pathway, respectively, which might be involved in the abnormal behaviors in zebrafish larvae. For higher exposure groups (30 and 300 μg/L), both BP-3 and BP-8 exposures changed metabolism of cofactors and vitamins of zebrafish larvae. Exposure of BP-3 altered the metabolism by pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway, while BP-8 exposure changed riboflavin metabolism and folate biosynthesis. The above results indicated different modes of action of BP-3 and BP-8 in zebrafish embryonic development. This study sheds new light to biological hazards of BP-3 due to its metabolism in aquatic organisms. © 2023},

	abstract = {Cardiovascular disease (CVD) poses the leading threats to human health and life, and their occurrence and severity are associated with exposure to environmental pollutants. Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of widely used industrial chemicals, are characterized by persistence, long-distance migration, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Some PFAS, particularly perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), have been banned, leaving only legacy exposure to the environment and human body, while a number of novel PFAS alternatives have emerged and raised concerns, such as polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic and carboxylic acid (PFESA and PFECA) and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS). Overall, this review systematically elucidated the adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of legacy and emerging PFAS, emphasized the dose/concentration-dependent, time-dependent, carbon chain length-dependent, sex-specific, and coexposure effects, and discussed the underlying mechanisms and possible prevention and treatment. Extensive epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggests that accumulated serum levels of legacy PFAS possibly contribute to an increased risk of CVD and its subclinical course, such as cardiac toxicity, vascular disorder, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The underlying biological mechanisms may include oxidative stress, signaling pathway disturbance, lipid metabolism disturbance, and so on. Various emerging alternatives to PFAS also play increasingly prominent toxic roles in CV outcomes that are milder, similar to, or more severe than legacy PFAS. Future research is recommended to conduct more in-depth CV toxicity assessments of legacy and emerging PFAS and explore more effective surveillance, prevention, and treatment strategies, accordingly. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Air tamponade's effectiveness in treatment of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment (RRD) remains unclear. Objective: We aimed to review the surgical outcomes between air and gas tamponade after vitrectomy for RRD. Method: PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were reviewed. The study protocol was registered in the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO CRD42022342284). The primary outcome was the primary anatomical success after vitrectomy. The secondary outcome was the prevalence of postoperative ocular hypertension. Certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation system. Results: Ten studies involving 2,677 eyes were included. One study was randomized, and the others were non-randomized. The primary anatomical success after vitrectomy was not significantly different between the air and gas groups (odds ratio [OR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.68-1.48). The risk of ocular hypertension was significantly lower in the air group (OR: 0.14; 95% CI: 0.09-0.24). The certainty of evidence regarding air tamponade having a comparable anatomical outcome and lower frequency of postoperative ocular hypertension in treatment of RRD were low. Discussion: The current evidence base for tamponade selection in treatment of RRD has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection.  © 2023 The Author(s). Published by S. Karger AG, Basel.

	abstract = {The development of efficient catalysts for application in the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) is of great relevance. Supported cobalt is preferred, and the choice of support is critical to the success of the process. For this, graphene materials have grown in interest due to their unique and appreciable characteristics. Thus, this study aims to perform a systematic review of previous studies which evaluated the use of graphene materials as support means for cobalt FTS catalysts. Twelve studies from the last five years were selected for extraction and analysis of results. The main parameters that influenced the catalytic activity of FTS catalysts were discussed, such as the type of support used, the chosen preparation method, and the graphene functionalization method. The results showed that the catalysts synthesized from different types of graphene support obtained CO conversion rates between 20 and 86.9% and high selectivity for C5 + compounds in the gasoline range. Furthermore, the functionalization of graphene with functional groups and pretreatment with nitric acid was essential to adjust the metal-support interaction and ensure catalytic efficiency. The preparation of catalysts involves a series of parameters that must be considered to ensure that the Co/C ratio produces an optimal particle size, consequently presenting better efficiency. Finally, this work highlights the potential to be explored of graphene materials used as support for FTS catalysts and their promising results. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Nowadays, the contamination caused by emerging pollutants is a global concern due to the lack of scientific evidence to demonstrate the risk or toxicity to humans due to the presence of pharmaceutical residues in the environment. This study aimed to identify and describe the disposal practices of unused and unwanted medications, as well as to analyze and identify the most frequent drugs determined on water bodies adjacent to the biggest urban population in Mexico. A two-phase study with an epidemiological and an ecological assessment was performed. The epidemiological phase was carried out with a descriptive cross-sectional study among citizens from Mexico City and the metropolitan area using an electronic survey applied to 719 subjects aimed to assess practices in which pharmaceutical products are disposed. The ecological phase included a review of scientific reports. The results show that nearly 83.5% of those surveyed use inappropriate practices for disposal medicines, the main ones are through the municipal dump or directly in the drain. The ecological approach was carried out by a systematic literature review of original reports published between 2013 to 2023; information about the class of drugs, active substance, environmental compartments, location, and concentration was extracted and presented. Fifty-one different types of pharmaceutical residues were detected in wastewater in Mexico City in the last decade. The results of this study can contribute to the application of public policies for waste management authorities to mitigate the socio-environmental risks due to the inappropriate disposal of medicines. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Emerging epidemiological evidence has linked per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure could be linked to the disturbance of gestational glucolipid metabolism, but the toxicological mechanism is unclear, especially when the exposure is at a low level. This study examined the glucolipid metabolic changes in pregnant rats treated with relatively low dose perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) through oral gavage during pregnancy [gestational day (GD): 1–18]. We explored the molecular mechanisms underlying the metabolic perturbation. Oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) and biochemical tests were performed to assess the glucose homeostasis and serum lipid profiles in pregnant Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats randomly assigned to starch, 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg·bw·d groups. Transcriptome sequencing combined with non-targeted metabolomic assays were further performed to identify differentially altered genes and metabolites in the liver of maternal rats, and to determine their correlation with the maternal metabolic phenotypes. Results of transcriptome showed that differentially expressed genes at 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg·bw·d PFOS exposure were related to several metabolic pathways, such as peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) signaling, ovarian steroid synthesis, arachidonic acid metabolism, insulin resistance, cholesterol metabolism, unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, bile acid secretion. The untargeted metabolomics identified 164 and 158 differential metabolites in 0.03 and 0.3 mg/kg·bw·d exposure groups, respectively under negative ion mode of Electrospray Ionization (ESI-), which could be enriched in metabolic pathways such as α-linolenic acid metabolism, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, glycerolipid metabolism, glucagon signaling pathway, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. Co-enrichment analysis indicated that PFOS exposure may disturb the metabolism pathways of glycerolipid, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, linoleic acid, steroid biosynthesis, glycine, serine and threonine. The key involved genes included down-regulated Ppp1r3c and Abcd2, and up-regulated Ogdhland Ppp1r3g, and the key metabolites such as increased glycerol 3-phosphate and lactosylceramide were further identified. Both of them were significantly associated with maternal fasting blood glucose (FBG) level. Our findings may provide mechanistic clues for clarifying metabolic toxicity of PFOS in human, especially for susceptible population such as pregnant women. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The reuse of household greywater is increasing globally. Wastewater and greywater treatment processes are not fully effective in removing all contaminants, such as emerging micropollutants, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes. The dynamics between emerging micropollutants and antibiotic resistance genes in greywater treatment systems are complex. Thus, this review aims to analyze the current knowledge on sources, spread, and the fate of emerging micropollutants, antibiotic-resistance genes, and antimicrobial-resistant bacteria in microbial communities of greywater and downstream recipients. The fate of antimicrobial resistance and emerging micropollutants from greywater in the environment has not been determined. More studies are needed to identify the mechanism/s involved in the degradation of emerging micropollutants and the presence of transformation pathways in the microbial metagenome. In the review, we aim to describe the link between the persistence of emerging micropollutants and the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. We showed that the effect of irrigation with treated wastewater was variable. In addition, we tried to summarize the impact of emerging micropollutants on bacteria and their fate in the soil microbiome, demonstrating that emerging micropollutants induce changes in the diversity of soil bacteria. The fate and transport of emerging micropollutants, antimicrobial-resistant bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes can vary with soil properties. It is, therefore, necessary to better understand how widely antibiotic-resistance genes are disseminated. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Environmental antibiotics raise serious health concerns due to their contribution to the obesity prevalence. Moreover, antibiotics promote antibiotic-resistance bacteria (ARB) which represent another emerging pollutant. However, the interaction between antibiotic and ARB in the obesogenic effects remained unexplored. In the present study, the obesogenic effects of tetracycline antibiotic (TCH) and ARB containing tetA were studied on C. elegans, and E. coli OP50 (OP50) was referred as a normal bacterial food. Results showed that TCH stimulated nematode triglyceride contents, while ARB alone had no significant influences. The combination of TCH and ARB showed less obesogenic effects than TCH alone, showing antagonism. Biochemical assays showed that the combination of TCH and ARB showed similar effects to ARB alone, and had less increases in lipid metabolism enzymes or metabolites than those of TCH or ARB alone, supporting the antagonism. In the nontargeted metabolomic analysis, TCH with ARB showed less significantly changed metabolites (SCMs) in the nematodes than TCH or ARB alone, partially explaining the antagonism. The metabolomic results also pointed out the significant involvement of amino acids, the carboxylic acids and derivatives, and also the benzene and substituted derivatives in the obesogenic effects of TCH and ARB.

	abstract = {Alterations of the normal gut microbiota can cause various human health concerns. Environmental chemicals are one of the drivers of such disturbances. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)—specifically, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy) propanoic acid (GenX)—on the microbiome of the small intestine and colon, as well as on liver metabolism. Male CD-1 mice were exposed to PFOS and GenX in different concentrations and compared to controls. GenX and PFOS were found to have different effects on the bacterial community in both the small intestine and colon based on 16S rRNA profiles. High GenX doses predominantly led to increases in the abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto, Alistipes, and Ruminococcus, while PFOS generally altered Lactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Staphylococcus, and Ligilactobacillus. These treatments were associated with alterations in several important microbial metabolic pathways in both the small intestine and colon. Untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis of the liver, small intestine, and colon yielded a set of compounds significantly altered by PFOS and GenX. In the liver, these metabolites were associated with the important host metabolic pathways implicated in the synthesis of lipids, steroidogenesis, and in the metabolism of amino acids, nitrogen, and bile acids. Collectively, our results suggest that PFOS and GenX exposure can cause major perturbations in the gastrointestinal tract, aggravating microbiome toxicity, hepatotoxicity, and metabolic disorders. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Objective: To analyze the association between maternal pesticide exposure and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorders (ADHD) in offspring. Method: Five databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, as well as PsycINFO were systematically retrieved for the records related to pesticide exposure during pregnancy and ASD and ADHD in offspring before August 30, 2022. The pesticide category, maternal age and window of exposure as the main subgroups were presented. Results: 949 studies were initially identified, and 19 studies were eventually included. Eleven were on ASD, seven were on ADHD, and one was on both disorders. Maternal pesticide exposure was positively related to ASD (pooled OR = 1.19 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.36)) and ADHD (pooled OR = 1.20 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.38)) in offspring. In the subgroup analysis, organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) (pooled OR = 1.14 (95%CI: 1.04 to 1.24)), pyrethroid (pooled OR = 1.40 (95%CI: 1.09 to 1.80)), and maternal age ≥30 years old (pooled OR = 1.24 (95%CI: 1.10 to 1.40)) increased the risk of ASD in offspring. Maternal organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) exposure was a risk factor for ADHD in offspring (pooled OR = 1.22 (95%CI: 1.03 to 1.45)). Conclusion: Maternal pesticide exposure increased the risk of ASD and ADHD in offspring. Moreover, OPs, pyrethroid, and maternal age ≥30 years old were found to be risk factors affecting children's ASD. Maternal exposure to OCPs increased the risk of ADHD in offspring. Our findings contribute to our understanding of health risks related to maternal pesticide exposure and indicate that the in utero developmental period is a vulnerable window-of-susceptibility for ASD and ADHD risk in offspring. These findings should guide policies that limit maternal exposure to pesticides, especially for pregnant women living in agricultural areas. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have drawn great attention due to their wide distribution in water bodies and toxicity to human beings. Adsorption is considered as an efficient treatment technique for meeting the increasingly stringent environmental and health standards for PFAS. This paper systematically reviewed the current approaches of PFAS adsorption using different adsorbents from drinking water as well as synthetic and real wastewater. Adsorbents with large mesopores and high specific surface area adsorb PFAS faster, their adsorption capacities are higher, and the adsorption process are usually more effective under low pH conditions. PFAS adsorption mechanisms mainly include electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interaction, anion exchange, and ligand exchange. Various adsorbents show promising performances but challenges such as requirements of organic solvents in regeneration, low adsorption selectivity, and complicated adsorbent preparations should be addressed before large scale implementation. Moreover, the aid of decision-making tools including response surface methodology (RSM), techno-economic assessment (TEA), life cycle assessment (LCA), and multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) were discussed for engineering applications. The use of these tools is highly recommended prior to scale-up to determine if the specific adsorption process is economically feasible and sustainable. This critical review presented insights into the most fundamental aspects of PFAS adsorption that would be helpful to the development of effective adsorbents for the removal of PFAS in future studies and provide opportunities for large-scale engineering applications. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Some studies have suggested that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) exposure may be associated with semen quality in the general population, but with inconsistent results. To identify a more precise relationship between them, a meta-analysis was performed. We searched Embase, the PubMed, The Cochrane Library, Ovid databases, and Web of Science databases (before March 2022) for appropriate studies on the correlations of PFAS exposure with semen parameters. We extracted β value and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to conduct meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses was performed by sample size, geographic location, and sample type. A total of seven articles involving 2190 participants were included in this study. The concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (β value = − 1.38; 95% CI: − 2.44, − 0.32) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) (β value = − 1.31, 95% CI: − 2.35, − 0.26) were negatively associated with sperm progressive motility. Subgroup analysis revealed that PFNA exposure was related to sperm morphology in studies with the sample size exceeding 200 people (β value = − 0.14; 95% CI: − 0.26, − 0.01). Our study supports that exposure to some PFASs (e.g., PFNA, PFOA) may be associated with semen quality, such as lower sperm progressive motility. Therefore, it is of great significance for the prevention of male infertility by control the use of PFASs. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Carbamazepine (CBZ) as an extensively distributed emerging pollutant has menaced ecological security. The degradation performance of CBZ by UV driven bisulfite process was investigated in this work. The kinetics results indicated that CBZ was high-efficiently degraded by UV/bisulfite following a pseudo first-order kinetic model (Kobs = 0.0925 min−1). SO4•− and •OH were verified as the reactive oxidants by EPR test and the radicals scavenging experiment using MeOH and TBA. SO4•− played a dominant role for CBZ degradation. The Density functional theory (DFT) and LC-qTOF-MS/MS clarified that hydroxylation, ketonation, ring opening reaction, and ring contraction were main transformation patterns of CBZ. As to influence factors, CBZ degradation was significantly hindered in presence of CO32−, HPO42− and NOM. Toxicological analysis derived from metabonomics suggested that the remarkable alteration of metabolic profile was triggered by exposure to intermediates mixture. CBZ intermediates interfered in several key metabolic pathways, including pentose phosphate, amino acids, lysine degradation, glycerophospholipid, glutathione, nucleotides and carbohydrate, which was alleviated after UV/bisulfite treatment. This work provided a meaningful support to potential risk of CBZ intermediates products, which shed light on the future application in eliminating drugs using UV /bisulfite. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Plastic microfibers (PMFs) are emerging pollutants widely distributed in the environment. In the early 2020s, the need for personal protection due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased consumption of plastic materials (e.g., facemasks and gloves) and ultimately to increased plastic pollution, especially by PMFs. The PMFs present in the environment may be released in this form (primary particles) or in larger materials, that will release them as a result of environmental conditions. Although a considerable number of studies have been addressing the effects of microplastics, most of them studied round particles, with fewer studies focusing on PMFs. Thus, the current study aimed to summarize and critically discuss the available data concerning the ecotoxicological impact of PMFs on aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms exposed to PMFs showed accumulation, mainly in the digestive tract, and several toxic effects, such as DNA damage, physiological alterations, digestive damage and even mortality, suggesting that PMFs can pose a risk for the health of aquatic organisms. The PMFs induced toxicity to aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate organisms depends on size, shape, chemical association and composition of fibers. Regarding other size range (nm) of plastic fibers, the literature review highlighted a knowledge gap in terms of the effects of plastic nanofibers on aquatic organisms. There is a knowledge gap in terms of the interaction and modes of action of PMFs associated with other pollutants. In addition, studies addressing effects at different trophic levels as well as the use of other biological models should be considered. Overall, research gaps and recommendations for future research and trends considering the environmental impact of the COVID-19 pandemic are presented. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) is a heterogeneous group with different types of diseases. It remains unclear as to what has led to an increase in incidences of NHL, however, chemical substance exposure is known to be one of the risk factors for the disease. Therefore, we performed a systematic review and meta-analysis including case-control, cohort, and cross-sectional observational epidemiological studies to verify the association between occupational exposure to carcinogens and NHL risk. Articles between the years 2000 and 2020 were collected. Two different reviewers performed a blind selection of the studies using the Rayyan QCRI web app. Post-completion, the selected articles were extracted and analyzed via the RedCap platform. Our review resulted in 2719 articles, of which 51 were included in the meta-analysis, resulting in an overall OR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.04–1.55). Furthermore, it was observed that the main occupation associated with the increased risk of NHL was that in which workers are exposed to pesticides. We therefore conclude that the evidence synthesis of the epidemiological literature supports an increased risk for NHL, regardless of subtype, considering occupational exposure to certain chemical compounds, mainly pesticides, benzene, and trichlorethylene, and certain classes of work, primarily in the field of agriculture. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {As an emerging pollutant, microplastics have attracted widespread concern around the world. Research on microplastics was first conducted in oceans, and in recent years, inland water, especially lakes, has gradually become a hot spot. This paper systematically reviews the sampling, separation, purification, and identification technologies used to assess microplastics in lakes and summarizes the occurrence of lake microplastics worldwide. The results show that microplastics are widespread in lake water and sediment. There are obvious geographical differences in the occurrence of microplastics. The abundance of microplastics in different lakes varies greatly. The forms are mostly fibrous and fragments, and the main polymers are polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). Previous papers have failed to comment in as much detail on the microplastic sampling techniques employed within lake systems. The sampling and analysis methods are critical to accurately evaluating contamination results. Due to the widespread presence of microplastics and the lack of uniform standards, there are various sampling methods. Trawls and grabs are most widely used in the sampling of lake water bodies and sediment, and sodium chloride and hydrogen peroxide are the most widely used media for flotation and digestion, respectively. In the future, it will be critical to establish unified standards for lake microplastic sampling and analysis technology, further explore the migration mechanism of microplastics in lake systems, and pay attention to the impact of microplastics on lake ecosystems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

	abstract = {Negative energy balance (EB) postpartum is associated with adverse outcomes in dairy cows; therefore, non-invasive biomarkers to measure EB are of particular interest. We determined whether specific metabolites, oxidative stress indicators, enzyme activity, and fatty acid (FA) profiles in milk can serve as indicators of negative EB. Forty-two multiparous Holstein dairy cows were divided at calving into 2 groups: one was milked 3 times daily and the other, twice a day for the first 30 d in milk (DIM). Cows were classified retrospectively as being in either negative EB (NEB, n = 19; the mean EB during the first 21 DIM were less than the overall median of −2.8 Mcal/d), or in positive EB (PEB, n = 21; the mean EB was ≥−2.8 Mcal/d). The daily milk yield, feed intake, and body weight were recorded individually. Blood samples were analyzed for metabolites and stress biomarkers. Milk samples were taken twice weekly from 5 to 45 DIM to analyze the milk solids, the FA profile, glucose, glucose-6-P (G6P), G6P-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity, malic and lactic acids, malondialdehyde (MDA), and oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC). The NEB cows produced 10.5% more milk, and consumed 7.6% less dry matter than the PEB cows. The plasma glucose concentration was greater and β-hydroxybutyrate was lower in the PEB vs. the NEB cows. The average concentrations of milk glucose, G6P, malic and lactic acids, and MDA did not differ between groups; however, the G6PDH activity was higher and ORAC tended to be higher in the milk of NEB vs. the PEB cows. The correlation between milk G6PDH activity and EB was significant (r = −0.39). The percentages of oleic acid and total unsaturated FA in milk were higher for the NEB vs. the PEB cows. These findings indicate that G6PDH activity in milk is associated with NEB and that it can serve as a non-invasive candidate biomarker of NEB in postpartum cows, that should be validated in future studies. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Heterogeneous photocatalysis using titanium dioxide-based materials is considered a promising and innovative solution to the water pollution problem. However, due to the limitations concerning the use of the developed materials and the applied photodegradation conditions, the research on photoremediation using TiO2 often stays behind the lab door. The challenge is to convert the basic research into a successful innovation, leading to the implementation of this process into wastewater treatment. For this purpose, the most active materials and optimal photodegradation conditions must be chosen. This article collects and compares the studies on photocatalytic degradation of an emerging pollutant – sulfamethoxazole, an antibacterial drug – and attempts to find the best approaches to be successfully applied on an industrial scale. Various types of TiO2-based photocatalysts are compared, including different nanoforms, doped or polymer-based composites, composites with graphene, activated carbon, dyes or natural compounds, as well as possible supporting materials for TiO2. The paper covers the impact of the irradiation source (natural sunlight, LED, mercury or xenon lamps) and water matrix on the photodegradation process, considering the ecological and economic sustainability of the process. Emphasis is put on the stability, ease of separation and reuse of the photocatalyst, power and safety of the irradiation source, identification of photodegradation intermediates and toxicity assays. The main approaches are critically discussed, main challenges and perspectives for an effective photocatalytic water treatment technology are pointed out. © 2022},

	abstract = {Purpose: Environmental endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) are a mixture of chemical compounds capable to interfere with endocrine axis at different levels and to which population is daily exposed. This paper aims to review the relationship between EDCs and breast, prostate, testicle, ovary, and thyroid cancer, discussing carcinogenic activity of known EDCs, while evaluating the impact on public health. Methods: A literature review regarding EDCs and cancer was carried out with particular interest on meta-analysis and human studies. Results: The definition of EDCs has been changed through years, and currently there are no common criteria to test new chemicals to clarify their possible carcinogenic activity. Moreover, it is difficult to assess the full impact of human exposure to EDCs because adverse effects develop latently and manifest at different ages, even if preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that developing fetus and neonates are most vulnerable to endocrine disruption. Conclusion: EDCs represent a major environmental and health issue that has a role in cancer development. There are currently some EDCs that can be considered as carcinogenic, like dioxin and cadmium for breast and thyroid cancer; arsenic, asbestos, and dioxin for prostate cancer; and organochlorines/organohalogens for testicular cancer. New evidence supports the role of other EDCs as possible carcinogenic and pregnant women should avoid risk area and exposure. The relationship between EDCs and cancer supports the need for effective prevention policies increasing public awareness. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Italian Society of Endocrinology (SIE).},

In terms of postoperative screw cut, pain, femoral shaft fracture, and secondary operations, InterTan is superior to PFNA and PFNA-II. Conversely, in terms of intraoperative blood loss, hospital stay, and postoperative Harris score, there is no significant difference between InterTan and PFNA and PFNA-II.

However, current epidemiological studies on the association between prenatal PFAS exposure and neurobehavioral problems among offspring, especially attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD), are inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to study the relationship between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and ADHD and ASD in offspring based on meta-analyses. Online databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, were searched comprehensively for eligible studies conducted before July 2021. Eleven studies (up to 8493 participants) were included in this analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that exposure to perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) was positively associated with ADHD in the highest quartile group. Negative associations were observed between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and ADHD/ASD, including between perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and ASD. There were no associations found between total PFAS concentration groups and neurobehavioral problems. The trial sequential analyses showed unstable results. Our findings indicated that PFOA and PFOS exposure during pregnancy might be associated with ADHD in offspring and that prenatal PFOS and PFNA exposure might be associated with ASD in offspring. According to the limited evidence obtained for most associations, additional studies are required to validate these findings. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the present study, pristine ZnWO4, CoWO4, and mixed metal Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 were synthesized through the hydrothermal process using a Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 ℃. The synthesized nanomaterials were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques, such as TEM, FTIR, UV–vis, XRD, and SEM-EDX-mapping to confirm the formation of nanocomposite material. The synthesized materials were explored as photocatalysts for the degradation of xylenol orange (XO) under a visible light source and a comparative study was explored to check the efficiency of the bimetallic co-doped nanocomposite to the pristine metal tungstate NPs. XRD analysis proved that reinforcement of Co2+ in ZnWO4 lattice results in a reduction in interplanar distance from 0.203 nm to 0.185 nm, which is reflected in its crystallite size, which reduced from 32 nm to 24 nm. Contraction in crystallite size reflects on the optical properties as the energy bandgap of ZnWO4 reduced from 3.49 eV to 3.33 eV in Zn0.5Co0.5WO4, which is due to the formation of a Z-scheme for charge transfer and enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency. The experimental results suggested that ZnWO4, CoWO4, and Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 NPs achieved a photocatalytic efficiency of 97.89%, 98.10%, and 98.77% towards XO in 120 min of visible solar light irradiation. The kinetics of photodegradation was best explained by pseudo-first-order kinetics and the values of apparent rate const (kapp) also supported the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of mixed metal Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 NPs towards XO degradation. © 2023 by the authors.},

This article aims to review the deaths due to poisoning among children in Saudi Arabia. A comprehensive search was conducted on 13 January 2022 using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases to identify articles that reported on pediatric poisoning deaths in Saudi Arabia. Eight articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in this systematic review. Some articles included one city, for instance, Jeddah or Riyadh, while others included different regions of the country. Children got poisoned most commonly at their homes by accidental ingestion. The common substances that caused fatality included drugs and pesticides. Low caregiver awareness and neglect were recognized as risk factors for pediatric poisoning. Further studies should be conducted to provide comprehensive details about the victims, the poisons involved, and the circumstances of pediatric poisonings in Saudi Arabia at the national and sub-national levels. Public awareness campaigns should be organized to raise community awareness about safety measures and risks of neglect to prevent pediatric poisonings. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Environmental exposure increases the risk of dyslipidemia, which affects human health. Research has shown that persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and phthalate metabolites, are associated with a higher risk of abnormal blood lipid levels in humans. However, the key molecules involved in dyslipidemia and the mechanisms are not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the biomarkers that mediate the relationships between blood lipids and four groups of POPs and revealed their potential mechanisms. Specifically, in 278 male blood samples, blood lipid and POPs levels were measured and metabolites were detected using untargeted metabolomics. Spearman's correlation analysis and binary logistic regression were employed to assess the relationship between POPs and lipid indexes. We observed that PFASs were associated with a higher risk of abnormal total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), while other POPs displayed little association with abnormal lipid indexes. Among all the PFASs, 6:2Cl-PFESA was associated with the fewest metabolites. A metabolome-wide association study combined with a meet-in-the-middle approach was used to identify potential biomarkers that mediate the association between POPs and abnormal blood lipids. The mediation analysis pointed to 105 significant mediators as potential biomarkers mediating the association between PFASs and TC, and 82 significant mediators were potential biomarkers that mediated the association between PFASs and LDL. 24-Hydroxycholesterol, 3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-al, PC(18:0/0:0), PC(22:5/0:0), GPCho(18:1/18:1), LysoPC(22:2(13Z,16Z)), LysoPC(16:0), 9(S)-HODE, 9,10-DHOME, L-glutamate, 4-hydroxybutyric acid, cytosine, PC(14:1(9Z)/18:0), sphinganine, and (S)-beta-aminoisobutyrate were identified as important biomarkers. The mechanism may mainly involves glycerophospholipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosynthesis, and linoleic acid metabolism. PPARγ likely plays a role in the associations between PFASs and abnormal cholesterol metabolism. Overall, our study provides clues for the early detection of PFAS-induced dyslipidemia and brings forth a theoretical framework for further research into this mechanism. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Filter feeding elasmobranchs may be considered as biological indicators of marine pollution, despite most of these species are under some degree of extinction risk. Among threats to this taxonomic group, marine pollution might represent an additional concern for their survival. In this review, a comprehensive systematic search of scientific literature on pollutants in filter feeding elasmobranchs was conducted to evaluate the bioaccumulation patterns, and risk for human consumers. We found that, despite an increasing trend in the number of published studies, the geographical coverage is still very limited and most of the studies focused solely on trace elements (70.8%). Among sharks, Rhincodon typus was the most represented species (66.7%), while Mobula mobular the most studied ray species (41.7%). Comparing the levels of pollutants in filter feeders between ocean basins, this review highlighted that Hg, As and Cd levels are mostly higher in those areas affected by both strong natural and anthropogenic source of emissions, such as the Indian Ocean. With regards to OCs, ΣPCB levels in muscle of C. maximus were between 4.3 and 50.5 μg kg−1 ww, highlighting a persistent contamination of PCB in the Mediterranean Sea. Some species exceeded the maximum allowable limits for foodstuff consumption for As, Cd and Pb. A total of 77.8% of the analyzed species exceeded the Environmental Quality Standards for Hg, while they were always below the EQSbiota for HCB, PBDEs, PFOS and DDT. Given their feeding mechanism that continuously samples the marine environment, further investigations are urgently needed to determine not only the extent of contaminant exposure in different hotspot locations but also the risks posed to the elasmobranch health. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) pose serious human health and environmental risks due to their persistence and toxicity. Among the available PFAS remediation options, the electrochemical approach is promising with better control. In this review, recent advances in the decontamination of PFAS from water using several state-of-the-art electrochemical strategies, including electro-oxidation, electro-adsorption, and electro-coagulation, were systematically reviewed. We aimed to elucidate their design principles, underlying working mechanisms, and the effects of operation factors (e.g., solution pH, applied voltage, and reactor configuration). The recent developments of innovative electrochemical systems and novel electrode materials were highlighted. In addition, the development of coupled processes that could overcome the shortcomings of low efficiency and high energy consumption of conventional electrochemical systems was also emphasized. This review identified several major knowledge gaps and challenges in the scalability and adaptability of efficient electrochemical systems for PFAS remediation. Materials science and system design developments are forging a path toward sustainable treatment of PFAS-contaminated water through electrochemical technologies.

	abstract = {Perfluorobutanesulfonate (PFBS), an alternative to perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS), has raised many health concerns. However, PFBS toxicity in the mammalian gut remains unclear. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 10 μg/L and 500 μg/L PFBS or 500 μg/L PFOS in their water supply for 28 days. PFBS toxicity in the ileum and colon was explored and compared to that of PFOS. Biochemical analysis showed that tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) and interleukin-1β (IL-1β) levels increased in the ileum exposed to 10 μg/L PFBS, whereas no significant changes were observed in those levels in the colon. Catalase (CAT) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), TNF-α, and IL-1β levels increased and glutathione (GSH) levels decreased in the ileum of the 500 μg/L-PFBS group, whereas only MDA levels increased in the colon of the 500 μg/L-PFBS group. The results showed that more severe damage occurred in the ileum than in the colon after PFBS exposure, and these align with the 500 μg/L-PFOS group exposure as well. Furthermore, metabolomic analysis revealed glutathione metabolism as a vital factor in inducing PFBS and PFOS toxicities in the ileum. Steroid hormone and amino acid metabolisms were other important factors involved in PFBS and PFOS toxicities, respectively. In the colon, GSH, pyrimidine, and glucose (especially galactose) metabolism was the main contributor to PFBS toxicity, and sulfur amino acid metabolism was the main pathway for PFOS toxicity. This study provides more evidence of the health hazards due to low-dose PFBS exposure in the mammalian gut. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Despite the advances in modern medicine, the use of data-driven technologies (DDTs) to prevent surgical site infections (SSIs) remains a major challenge. Scholars recognise that data management is the next frontier in infection prevention, but many aspects related to the benefits and advantages of using DDTs to mitigate SSI risk factors remain unclear and underexplored in the literature. This study explores how DDTs enable value creation in the prevention of SSIs. This study follows a systematic literature review approach and the PRISMA statement to analyse peer-reviewed articles from seven databases. Fifty-nine articles were included in the review and were analysed through a descriptive and a thematic analysis. The findings suggest a growing interest in DDTs in SSI prevention in the last 5 years, and that machine learning and smartphone applications are widely used in SSI prevention. DDTs are mainly applied to prevent SSIs in clean and clean-contaminated surgeries and often used to manage patient-related data in the postoperative stage. DDTs enable the creation of nine categories of value that are classified in four dimensions: cost/sacrifice, functional/instrumental, experiential/hedonic, and symbolic/expressive. This study offers a unique and systematic overview of the value creation aspects enabled by DDT applications in SSI prevention and suggests that additional research is needed in four areas: value co-creation and product-service systems, DDTs in contaminated and dirty surgeries, data legitimation and explainability, and data-driven interventions. © 2023, The Author(s).},

This study aims to determine the inhibition of PFASs towards sulfotransferases (SULTs) activity, and trying to explain the toxicity mechanism of PFASs. In vitro recombinant SULTs-catalyzed sulfation of p-nitrophenol (PNP) was utilized as a probe reaction. The incubation system was consisted of PFASs, SULTs, PNP, 3′-phosphoadenosine-5′-phosphosulfate, MgCl2 and Tris-HCl buffer. Ultra-performance liquid chromatography was employed for analysis of the metabolites. All tested PFASs showed inhibition towards SULTs. The longer the carbon chain length of the PFASs terminated with –COOH, the higher is its capability of inhibiting SULT1A3. PFASs with –SO3H had a relatively higher ability to inhibit SULT1A3 activity than those with –COOH, –I and –OH. The inhibition kinetic parameter was 2.16 and 1.42 μM for PFOS-SULT1A1, PFTA-SULT1B1. In vitro in vivo extrapolation showed that the concentration of PFOS and PFTA in human matrices might be higher than the threshold for inducing inhibition of SULTs. Therefore, PFASs could interfere with the metabolic pathways catalyzed by SULTs in vivo. All these results will help to understand the toxicity of PFASs from the perspective of metabolism. © 2023},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Associations between per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and blood lipid levels in humans were mixed. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize associations between PFAS and blood lipids in adults. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed and Web of Science for articles published through 13 May 2022 that examined associations between PFAS and blood lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triacylglycerols (TGs). Inclusion criteria included the presence of associations between five PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFDA, and PFNA) and four blood lipid measures (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TGs) in adults. Data on study characteristics and PFAS–lipid associations were extracted. Assessments of individual study quality were performed. Associations of changes of blood lipid levels corresponding to 1 interquartile range (IQR)-unit increase of blood PFAS levels were pooled using random effects models. Dose–response relationships were examined. RESULTS: Twenty-nine publications were included in the present analyses. Every IQR increase of PFOA was significantly associated with a 2:1-mg=dL increase in TC (95% CI: 1.2, 3.0), a 1:3-mg=dL increase in TGs (95% CI: 0.1, 2.4), and a 1:4-mg=dL increase in LDL-C (95% CI: 0.6, 2.2). PFOS was also significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels, and the corresponding values were 2.6 (95% CI: 1.5, 3.6) and 1.9 (95% CI: 0.9, 3.0), respectively. Associations of PFOS and PFOA with HDL-C levels were largely null. For minor PFAS species, PFHxS was significantly associated with higher levels of HDL-C [0.8 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.2)]. Inverse associations were observed between PFDA and TGs [−5:0 (95% CI: −8:1, −1:9)] and between PFNA and TGs [−1:7 (95% CI: −3:5, −0:02)], whereas a positive association was observed between PFDA and HDL-C [1.4 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.7)]. Nonsignificant nonlinear dose–response relationships were identified for associations of PFOA and PFOS with certain blood lipids. DISCUSSION: PFOA and PFOS were significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels in adults. Whether these findings may translate into an elevated cardiovascular disease risk associated with PFAS exposure warrants further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11840. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

	abstract = {Axenic microbial applications in the open environment are unrealistic and may not be always practically viable. Therefore, it is important to use mixed microbial cultures and their interactions with the microbiome in the targeted ecosystem to perform robust functions towards their sustainability in harsh environmental conditions. Emerging pollutants like phthalates and hydrocarbons that are toxic to several aquatic and terrestrial life forms in the water bodies and lands are an alarming situation. The present review explores the possibility of devising an inclusive eco-friendly strategy like microbiome engineering which proves to be a unique and crucial technology involving the power of microbial communication through quorum sensing. This review discusses the interspecies and intra-species communications between different microbial groups with their respective environments. Moreover, this review also envisages the efforts for designing the next level of microbiome-host engineering concept (MHEC). The focus of the review also extended toward using omics and metabolic network analysis-based tools for effective microbiome engineering. These approaches might be quite helpful in the future to understand such microbial interactions but it will be challenging to implement in the real environment to get the desired functions. Finally, the review also discusses multiple approaches for the bioremediation of toxic chemicals from the soil environment. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Inhalation of PCB-contaminated air is increasingly recognized as a route for PCB exposure. Because limited information about the disposition of PCBs following inhalation exposure is available, this study investigated the disposition of 2,2′,5,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB52) and its metabolites in rats following acute, nose-only inhalation of PCB52. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (50-58 days of age, 210 ± 27 g; n = 6) were exposed for 4 h by inhalation to approximately 14 or 23 μg/kg body weight of PCB52 using a nose-only exposure system. Sham animals (n = 6) were exposed to filtered lab air. Based on gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), PCB52 was present in adipose, brain, intestinal content, lung, liver, and serum. 2,2′,5,5′-Tetrachlorobiphenyl-4-ol (4-OH-PCB52) and one unknown monohydroxylated metabolite were detected in these compartments except for the brain. Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis identified several metabolites, including sulfated, methoxylated, and dechlorinated PCB52 metabolites. These metabolites were primarily found in the liver (7 metabolites), lung (9 metabolites), and serum (9 metabolites) due to the short exposure time. These results demonstrate for the first time that complex mixtures of sulfated, methoxylated, and dechlorinated PCB52 metabolites are formed in adolescent rats following PCB52 inhalation, laying the groundwork for future animal studies of the adverse effects of inhaled PCB52. © 2024 The Authors.

	abstract = {Micro-structured surfaces possess excellent properties of friction, lubrication, drag reduction, antibacterial, and self-cleaning, which have been widely applied in optical, medical, national defense, aerospace fields, etc. Therefore, it is requisite to study the fabrication methods of micro-structures to improve the accuracy and enhance the performance of micro-structures. At present, there are plenty of studies focusing on the preparation of micro-structures; therefore, systematic review of the technologies and developing trend on the fabrication of micro-structures are needed. In present review, the fabrication methods of various micro-structures are compared and summarized. Specially, the characteristics and applications of ultra-precision machining (UPM) technology in the fabrication of micro-structures are mainly discussed. Additionally, the assistive technologies applied into UPM, such as fast tool servo (FTS) technology and slow tool servo (STS) technology to fabricate micro-structures with different characteristics are summarized. Finally, the principal characteristics and applications of fly cutting technology in manufacturing special micro-structures are presented. From the review, it is found that by combining different machining methods to prepare the base layer surface first and then fabricate the sublayer surface, the advantages of different machining technologies can be greatly exerted, which is of great significance for the preparation of multi-layer and multi-scale micro-structures. Furthermore, the combination of ultra-precision fly cutting and FTS/STS possess advantages in realizing complex micro-structures with high aspect ratio and high resolution. However, residual tool marks and material recovery are still the key factors affecting the form accuracy of machined micro-structures. This review provides advances in fabrication methods and assistive technologies of micro-structured surfaces, which serves as the guidance for both fabrication and application of multi-layer and multi-scale micro-structures. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {This study has objective to determine the metabolites classes contained in the hexane, EtOAc, BuOH, and aqueous fractions partitioned from the MeOH extract of the Callyspongia affinis sponge from Kangean Island, Indonesia. This study used a sponge from Kangean Island collected at 3–10 m depth as a research sample. The collected sample was then identified in the Zoology and Animal Engineering Laboratory, Sepuluh Nopember Institute of Technology, Surabaya, Indonesia. The extracts and fractions were investigated for their ability in terms of free radical scavenging, toxicity, antiproliferation, and apoptotic activity against HeLa and MCF-7 cells. The results showed that all fractions have organic nitrogen metabolites in the form of alkaloids and amide functional groups. The EtOAc and BuOH fractions contain fluorinated organic halides, while the aqueous fraction contains chlorinated organic halides. The EtOAc fraction showed the best ability as free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picryl-hydrazyl-hydrate scavenging with an IC50 of 27.617 μg/mL. It has the highest toxicity against Artemia salina with an LC50 of 26.652 μg/mL. The EtOAc fraction showed the best antiproliferative ability against HeLa and MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 94.934 ± 0.700 and 97.804 ± 0.241 μg/mL, respectively. The EtOAc extract also showed the best apoptotic ability to HeLa and MCF-7 cells with IC50 values of 143.380 ± 0.010 and 131.646 ± 0.011 μg/mL, followed by MeOH extract and hexane fractions. © 2023 Moh Farid Rahman et al.

Six studies were included in this review. Three studies evaluated the acute exposure to the chemical factory accident in Seveso, Italy, and found a non-significant increase in the risk of thyroid cancer. Two studies investigating Agent Orange exposure among United States Vietnam War veterans found a significant risk of thyroid cancer following exposure. No association was found in one study evaluating TCDD exposure through herbicides. The current study highlights the limited information on the potential association between TCDD exposure and thyroid cancer and thus the need for future human studies, especially considering the persistent human exposure to dioxins in the environment. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We used a systematic review that included risk of bias and study sensitivity analysis to identify 34 studies examining changes in birth weight (BWT) in relation to PFNA biomarker measures (e.g., maternal serum/plasma or umbilical cord samples). We fit a random effects model of the overall pooled estimate and stratified estimates based on sample timing and overall study confidence. We conducted a meta-regression to further examine the impact of gestational age at biomarker sample timing. We detected a −32.9 g (95%CI: −47.0, −18.7) mean BWT deficit per each ln PFNA increase from 27 included studies. We did not detect evidence of publication bias (pE = 0.30) or between-study heterogeneity in the summary estimate (pQ = 0.05; I2 = 36%). The twelve high confidence studies yielded a smaller pooled effect estimate (β = −28.0 g; 95%CI: −49.0, −6.9) than the ten medium (β = −39.0 g; 95%CI: −61.8, −16.3) or four low (β = −36.9 g; 95%CI: −82.9, 9.1) confidence studies. The stratum-specific results based on earlier pregnancy sampling periods in 11 studies showed smaller deficits (β = −22.0 g; 95%CI: −40.1, −4.0) compared to 10 mid- and late-pregnancy (β = −44.2 g; 95%CI: −64.8, −23.5) studies and six post-partum studies (β = −42.9 g; 95%CI: −88.0, 2.2). Using estimates of the specific gestational week of sampling, the meta-regression showed results consistent with the categorical sample analysis, in that as gestational age at sampling time increases across these studies, the summary effect estimate of a mean BWT deficit got larger. Overall, we detected mean BWT deficits for PFNA that were larger and more consistent across studies than previous PFAS meta-analyses. Compared to studies with later sampling, BWT deficits were smaller but remained sizeable for even the earliest sampling periods. Contrary to earlier meta-analyses for PFOA and PFOS, BWT deficits that were detected across all strata did not appear to be fully explained by potential bias due to pregnancy hemodynamics from sampling timing differences. © 2023},

	abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is ubiquitous in aquatic environment, posing serious threats to human health, while the potential of anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) process in treating PFOA-containing wastewater and the response mechanism of anammox consortia to PFOA remain unknown. In this study, the comprehensive effects of PFOA on anammox granules and their interaction mechanism were investigated based on molecular simulation and metabolomic analysis. The environmental concentrations (≤2.0 mg/L) of PFOA had no impact on the anammox process performance. However, microbial consortia structure and functional gene abundances changed under the exposure of PFOA. By contrast, Prokaryotes were more sensitive to PFOA than eukaryotes. In addition, PFOA regulated microbial metabolic pathways, including amino acid metabolism and nucleotide metabolism, by changing the cell energy allocation strategy. Molecular docking simulation suggested that the effects of PFOA on key proteins in anammox bacteria were significantly different. These findings provide insights into the interaction between anammox consortia and PFOA, and further promote the implementation of anammox process to treat fluorine-containing wastewater. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Exposure to per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is ubiquitous and has been associated with an increased risk of several cardio-metabolic diseases. However, the metabolic pathways linking PFAS exposure and human disease are unclear. OBJECTIVE: We examined associations of PFAS mixtures with alterations in metabolic pathways in independent cohorts of adolescents and young adults. METHODS: Three hundred twelve overweight/obese adolescents from the Study of Latino Adolescents at Risk (SOLAR) and 137 young adults from the Southern California Children’s Health Study (CHS) were included in the analysis. Plasma PFAS and the metabolome were determined using liquid-chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. A metabolome-wide association study was performed on log-transformed metabolites using Bayesian regression with a g-prior specification and g-computation for modeling exposure mixtures to estimate the impact of exposure to a mixture of six ubiquitous PFAS (PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA). Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Mummichog and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Significance across cohorts was determined using weighted Z-tests. RESULTS: In the SOLAR and CHS cohorts, PFAS exposure was associated with alterations in tyrosine metabolism (meta-analysis p = 0:00002) and de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (p = 0:03), among others. For example, when increasing all PFAS in the mixture from low (∼ 30th percentile) to high (∼ 70th percentile), thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone related to tyrosine metabolism, increased by 0.72 standard deviations (SDs; equivalent to a standardized mean difference) in the SOLAR cohort (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 0.00, 1.20) and 1.60 SD in the CHS cohort (95% BCI: 0.39, 2.80). Similarly, when going from low to high PFAS exposure, arachidonic acid increased by 0.81 SD in the SOLAR cohort (95% BCI: 0.37, 1.30) and 0.67 SD in the CHS cohort (95% BCI: 0.00, 1.50). In general, no individual PFAS appeared to drive the observed associations. DISCUSSION: Exposure to PFAS is associated with alterations in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in adolescents and young adults. https:// doi.org/10.1289/EHP11372. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

	abstract = {Prenatal exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals has been linked to gestational hypertension (GH) and preeclampsia (PE). However, the results were conflicting and inconclusive. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis for an overview of these relationships. We searched PubMed, and Google Scholar for studies investigating bisphenol A, phthalates, and per or poly-fluoroalkyl substances and GH or PE. Pooled odds ratio (OR) with a 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated for risk estimate using the generic inverse variance method. A total of 14 studies were included in the present analysis. The pooled results demonstrated that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA, OR:1.20, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.39), perfluoro octane sulfonic acid (PFOS, (OR:1.23, 95% CI: 1.10, 1.38), and perfluononanoic acid (PFNA, OR:1.20, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.40) were significantly associated with an increased risk of PE. There was no significant association observed with perfluoro hexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluoro decanoic acid (PFDA), perfluoro heptanoic acid (PFHpA), and perfluoro undecanoic acid (PFUnDA) and PE. For GH, a statistically significant positive association was found with PFOA (OR:1.18, 95% CI: 1.01, 1.39) and PFHxS (OR:1.15, 95% CI: 1.02, 1.29). Among various phthalates analysed only mono-ethyl phthalate (MEP, OR:1.37, 95% CI: 1.11, 1.70) showed an association with GH. From our analysis, bisphenol A exposure during pregnancy did not show a significant association with the risk of PE. Our findings indicated that exposure to PFASs such as PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of PE and PFOA and PFHxS with GH. We also found that MEP was associated with GH. Most of the results were unstable in sensitivity analysis. Since most of these associations have limited evidence, more research is needed to confirm these findings. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Fluorene (Flu) occurs widely in various environments and its toxicity to organisms is well-known. However, the impact of Flu on complicated biochemical processes involving functional microbial community has been reported rarely. In this study, the facilitation of Flu on the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) generation executed by acidogenic microbial population during sludge acidogenic fermentation (37 °C, SRT = 8 d, pH = 10.0) was investigated. The accumulation of VFAs (particularly acetic acid) increased initially and then declined with the increasing of Flu concentration (0-500 mg/kg dry sludge), which reached a maximum (3211.1 mg COD/L) as Flu content was 200 mg/kg dry sludge. The Flu-enhanced VFAs production was primarily attributed to the shift of hydrolysis/acidification, as well as the corresponding functional microbial community and the activity of enzymes. Based on the metagenomics analysis, the conversion of organic substrates, i.e. amino acid and monosaccharide, into VFAs embraced in hydrolysis/acidification shaped by Flu was constructed at the genetic level. The relative abundances of genes included in aminotransfer and deamination process of amino acid and glycolysis of monosaccharide into VFA-precursors (pyruvate, acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA), and the further formation of VFAs were improved due to the Flu presence. This study shed light on the Flu-affected microbial processes at the molecular biology level during acidogenic fermentation and was of great significance in resource recovery of sludge containing persistent organic pollutants. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Anaerobic ammonium oxidation (anammox) is a promising low carbon and economic biological nitrogen removal technology. Considering the anammox technology has been easily restricted by environmental factors in practical engineering applications, therefore, it is necessary to understand the metabolic response characteristics of anammox bacteria to different environmental factors, and then guide the application of the anammox process. This review presented the latest advances of the research progress of the effects of different environmental factors on the metabolic pathway of anammox bacteria. The effects as well as mechanisms of conventional environmental factors and emerging pollutants on the anammox metabolic processes were summarized. Also, the role of quorum sensing (QS) mediating the bacteria growth, gene expression and other metabolic process in the anammox system were also reviewed. Finally, interaction and cross-feeding mechanisms of microbial communities in the anammox system were discussed. This review systematically summarized the variations of metabolic mechanism response to the external environment and cross-feeding interactions in the anammox process, which would provide an in-depth understanding for the anammox metabolic process and a comprehensive guidance for future anammox-related metabolic studies and engineering applications. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Microplastics (<5 mm) (MPs) are widely distributed throughout the world, and their accumulation and migration in the environment have caused health and safety concerns. Currently, most of the reviewed literatures mainly focus on the distribution in various environmental media, adsorption mechanisms with different pollutants, and characterization of MPs. Therefore, the present review mainly highlights the characterization techniques of MPs and the underlying mechanisms of their combination with conventional coexisting substances (heavy metals, organic pollutants, and nutrients). We observed that massive MP pollution has been found in many areas, especially in Africa, Asia, India, South Africa, North America and Europe. The separation methods of MPs in different environmental media are basically similar, including sampling, pre-treatment, flotation, filtration and digestion. The combination of multiple characterization technologies can more precisely identify the shape, abundance, colour, and particle size of MPs. Notably, although recent reports have confirmed that MPs can act as carriers of heavy metals and carry them into organisms to cause harm, MPs have different adsorption and desorption characteristics for various heavy metals. The adsorption capacity of organic pollutants onto MPs is closely related to their hydrophobicity, specific surface area and functional group characteristics. The relative abundance of MPs in sediments and lakes had a significantly positive correlation with the mass concentration of total nitrogen in lake water, but this finding still needs to be further verified. Based on current research, we suggest that future MP research should focus on characterization technology, environmental migration, ecological effects, health risks and degradation methods. © 2022},

	abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a typical perfluorinated compound widely existing in the environment. It is highly toxic and difficult to degrade, which seriously threatens eco-environmental safety and human genetic, immune, neurological and reproductive health. Hence, considerable attention has been drawn to its environmental hazard and risk prevention and control. With mild conditions, high treatment efficiency, low application cost, free secondary pollution and other advantages, photocatalytic technology has a broad application prospect in the field of PFOA degradation. In order to develop new photocatalytic materials with strong activity, good visible light absorption performance, and high stability, and achieve efficient degradation of PFOA in water, research progress in the preparation of photocatalytic degradation materials of PFOA in the past twenty years was systematically reviewed. The degradation characteristics and existing problems of different photocatalytic degradation materials were comprehensively analyzed. The reaction mechanism and activity enhancement mechanism of photocatalytic degradation materials were summarized, combined with the existing materials of photocatalytic degradation of PFOA, and eventually the photocatalytic degradation pathway of PFOA was clarified. © 2023 Journal of Central South University (Medical Sciences).

	abstract = {Fe-based Fischer-Tropsch synthesis (FTS) catalysts usually exist as the oxide precursor α-Fe2O3, which have different catalytic activities after being transformed to FexCy under different pretreatment conditions, so it is critical to study the pretreatment process of α-Fe2O3 for whole FTS reaction. However, the phases of Fe-based catalysts in such a process are highly dynamic and complex, and conventional characterizations cannot capture the accurate real-time information in the pretreatment reaction. Therefore, it is necessary and desired to apply various in-situ characterizations in this process, because they can obtain the dynamic changes of phase, morphology, surface structure and properties of the catalyst. And then a relationship between the pretreatment process and the subsequent catalytic performance of FTS will be effectively and reasonably established. This review presents a systematic summary of the experimental and data processing methods in in-situ characterizations of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy during the pretreatment of Fe-based FTS catalysts. These characterizations can clarify the complex structure and surface property changes of catalyst precursors and thus will facilitate the design and development of more efficient Fe-based FTS catalysts. © 2023 Science Press.

	abstract = {Background: The gestational risk factors predispose to the manifestation of early childhood atopic dermatitis (AD). Objective: We evaluated the association between modifiable and non-modifiable gestational and prenatal risk factors that affect the AD prevalence in children. Methods: We performed the systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies (n=27) in PubMed and EMBASE (2000~2021). A meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratio (HR). We performed a systematic review according to Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and summarized cohort studies investigating gestational and prenatal risk factor those predispose to AD in off spring. Leading modifiable and non-modifiable were identified through ORs. Meta-analysis using the random effect model was also conducted to provide an overall estimate for several significant factors. Results: Among the non-modifiable risk factors gestational diabetes (7.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4~34.5), maternal history of allergy (2.14, 95% CI: 1.54~2.97) and prenatal history of eczema (2.46, 95% CI: 1.0~5.8) were found as major determining risk factors in early manifestation of AD in children. Further, maternal exposure to industrial products (1.89, 95% CI: 1.10~3.16), exposure to antibiotics during pregnancy (3.59, 95% CI: 1.19~10.85) and passive smoking during pregnancy (2.60, 95% CI: 1.11~6.1) are leading causes of early AD manifestation. Conclusion: Conclusively, both genetic and environmental factors play a pivotal role in early manifestation of AD. The better managing the environmental factors during gestational phase to the least can help curtail the prevalence of AD in children. © 2023 Korean Dermatological Association. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {The rise in the global population demands an increasing food supply and methods to boost agricultural production. Pesticides are necessary for agricultural production models, avoiding losses of close to 40%. Nevertheless, the extensive use of pesticides can cause their accumulation in the environment, causing problems for human health, biota, and ecosystems. Thus, new technologies have emerged to remove these wastes efficiently. In recent years, metal and metal oxide nanoparticles (MNPs) have been reported as promising catalysts to degrade pesticides; however, a systematic understanding of their effect on pesticide degradation is still required. Therefore, this study focused on a meta-analysis of articles available in Elsevier’s Scopus and Thomas Reuters Web of Science, found by searching for “nanoparticle pesticide” and “pesticide contamination.” After passing different filters, the meta-analysis was performed with 408 observations from 94 reviews, which comprise insecticides, herbicides, and fungicides, including organophosphates, organochlorines, carbamates, triazines, and neonicotinoids. Herein, 14 different MNPs (Ag, Ni, Pd, Co3O4, BiOBr, Au, ZnO, Fe, TiO2, Cu, WO3, ZnS, SnO2, and Fe0), improved pesticide degradation, with the highest degradation rates achieved by Ag (85%) and Ni (82.5%). Additionally, the impact of the MNP functionalization, size, and concentration on pesticide degradation was quantified and compared. In general, the degradation rate increased when the MNPs were functionalized (~ 70%) compared to naked (~ 49%). Also, the particle size significantly affected the degradation of pesticides. To our knowledge, this study is the first meta-analysis performed about the impact of MNPs on pesticide degradation, providing an essential scientific basis for future studies. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Excessive use of feed additives and chemical fertilizers leads to the accumulation of antibiotics and heavy metals in water environments. Studies have reported the toxicity of combined pollutants on the performance and microbial community in sequencing batch reactors. However, the influence of combined pollutants on nitrogen removal in wetlands remains unclear. Here, an 84 d exposure experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of cadmium (Cd) and doxycycline (DC) on nitrogen metabolism in ecological ditches using metagenomic analysis. The results showed that adding 50 mg L−1 DC at 5 mg L−1 Cd stress deteriorated nitrogen removal performance and significantly increased N2O emissions and lactate dehydrogenase release. However, a low level of Cd (0.5 mg L−1) significantly reduced N2O emissions under the high DC concentration pressure (50 mg L−1). The increasing Cd concentration markedly weakened the inhibition of DC (1 mg L−1) on the relative abundances of the dominant genera. Moreover, high concentrations of mixed Cd/DC showed stronger inhibitory effects on glucokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase. NADH had a higher tolerance to mixed Cd/DC than ATP. However, low levels of mixed Cd/DC led to a higher abundance of key denitrifying enzymes and genes. The assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway increased under the mixture of Cd/DC stress, accompanied by an increase in ferredoxin-nitrite/nitrate reductase and the abundance of nasA and nirA genes. Our results indicate that the presence of low-level Cd could alleviate the impact of DC on nitrogen removal and N2O emissions in ecological ditches by altering microbial community and enzymatic activity associated with transport, metabolism, and gene expression. However, the increasing Cd concentration at DC stress could intensify the combined toxicity. Overall, our findings provide new insights into the ecological toxicity of emerging combined pollutants and their impact on biological nitrogen transformation in wastewater treatment systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Milk formation in the breast during breastfeeding is a complex hormonally regulated process, potentially sensitive to the effects of endocrine-disrupting chemical exposures. The environmental chemicals, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are known endocrine disruptors. PFAS exposure have been associated with insufficient mammary gland development in mice and reduced breastfeeding duration in humans. The aim of this review was to gather the epidemiological evidence on the association between PFAS exposure and breastfeeding duration. Using PubMed and Embase, we performed a systematic literature search (on 23 January 2023) to identify epidemiological studies examining the association between maternal PFAS exposure and breastfeeding duration. Animal studies, reviews, and non-English studies were excluded. The risk of bias was assessed using the risk of bias in non-randomized studies of exposures tool. Estimates describing the association between PFAS exposure and the duration of breastfeeding were identified, and the data were synthesized separately for each type of PFAS and for the duration of exclusive and total breastfeeding. Six studies with between 336 and 2374 participants each were identified. PFAS exposure was assessed in serum samples (five studies) or based on residential address (one study). Five out of six studies found shorter total duration of breastfeeding with higher PFAS exposure. The most consistent associations were seen for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). The finding of a potential causal association between PFAS exposure and breastfeeding duration is in agreement with findings from experimental studies. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: In utero perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure has been associated with childhood adiposity, but the mechanisms are poorly known. Objective: To investigate the potential mediating role of neonatal metabolites in the relationship between prenatal PFAS exposure and childhood adiposity trajectories in the first four years of life. Methods: We analyzed the data for 1671 mother-child pairs from the Shanghai Birth Cohort study. We included those with PFAS exposure information in early pregnancy, neonatal metabolites data and at least three child anthropometric measurements at 6, 12, 24 and/or 48 months. Body mass index (BMI) z-score trajectories were identified using latent class growth mixture modeling. The associations between PFAS concentrations and trajectory classes were assessed using multinomial logistic regression. Screening and penalization-based selection was used to identify neonatal amino acids and acylcarnitines with significant mediation effects. Results: Three BMI z-score trajectories in early childhood were identified: a persistent increase trajectory (Class 1, 2.2 %), a stable trajectory (Class 2, 66 %), and a transient increase trajectory (Class 3, 32 %). Increased odds of being in Class 1 were observed in association with one log-unit increase in concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (odds ratio [OR], 1.76 [95 % CI, 0.96–3.23], Class 2 as reference; OR, 2.36 [95 % CI, 1.27–4.40], Class 3 as reference), perfluorononanoic acid (OR, 1.90 [95 % CI, 0.97–3.72], Class 2 as reference; OR, 2.23 [95 % CI, 1.12–4.42], Class 3 as reference) and perfluorodecanoic acid (OR, 1.95 [95 % CI, 1.12–3.38], Class 2 as reference; OR, 2.14 [95 % CI, 1.22–3.76], Class 3 as reference). The effect of prenatal PFAS exposure on being in Class 1 was significantly but partly mediated by octanoylcarnitine (2.64 % for perfluorononanoic acid and 3.70 % for sum of 10 PFAS). Conclusions: In utero PFAS exposure is a risk factor for persistent growth in BMI z-score in early childhood. The alteration of neonatal acylcarnitines suggests a potential molecular pathway. © 2023},

The discovery of harmful components is the prerequisite for pollution control; however, this raises a great challenge on recognizing previously unknown species. Here we systematically review the analytical techniques on air pollution in the framework of an omics approach, with a brief introduction on sample preparation and analysis, and in more detail, compounds prioritization and identification. Through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS, typically coupled with chromatography), the complicated environmental matrix can be digitalized into “full-component” data. A key step to discover emerging compounds is the prioritization of compounds from massive data. Chemical fingerprints, suspect lists and biological effects are the most vital untargeted strategies for comprehensively screening critical and hazardous substances. Afterward, compressed data of compounds can be identified at various confidence levels according to exact mass and the derived molecular formula, MS libraries, and authentic standards. Such an omics approach on full-component data provides a paradigm for discovering emerging air pollutants; nonetheless, new technological advancements of instruments and databases are warranted for further tracking the environmental behaviors, hence to evaluate the health risk of key pollutants.

	abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a novel type of persistent synthetic organic pollutant, and its exposure on pregnant women can cause some adverse effects, such as pregnancy-induced hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preeclampsia. Therefore, understanding the metabolic changes caused by PFOA exposure is of great significance to protect pregnant women from its adverse effects. In this study, the metabolomes from the urine samples of pregnant women exposure to PFOA at different degrees were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. The samples in different groups were distinguished and the differential metabolites were screened based on the VIP value, FC, and P-value of each comparison group through multivariate statistical analysis. The pathways related to differential metabolites were searched to reveal the effects of PFOA exposure on metabolic changes in pregnant women at different degrees. Finally, the ROC of differential metabolites was performed, and the differential metabolites with large area under the curve (AUC) values were selected and compared to identify the mutually differential metabolites. Meanwhile, these metabolites were fitted with a multivariable to explore if they could be used to distinguish different groups. The quantitative comparison of mutually differential metabolites revealed that the levels of L-cysteine, glycine, and 5-aminovaleric acid were positively correlated with the degree of PFOA exposure, indicating that different degrees of PFOA exposure could affect the synthesis or degradation of GSH and change the metabolism of oral or intestinal microbiota. Additionally, they may cause oxidative stress and abnormal fat metabolism in pregnant women. [Figure not available: see fulltext.] © 2023, Higher Education Press.},

	abstract = {Introduction: In vitro metabolic fingerprinting encodes diverse diseases for clinical practice, while tedious sample pretreatment in bio-samples has largely hindered its universal application. Designed materials are highly demanded to construct diagnostic tools for high-throughput metabolic information extraction. Results: Herein, a ternary component chip composed of mesoporous silica substrate, plasmonic matrix, and perfluoroalkyl initiator is constructed for direct metabolic fingerprinting of biofluids by laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry. Method: The performance of the designed chip is optimized in terms of silica pore size, gold sputtering time, and initiator loading parameter. The optimized chip can be coupled with microarrays to realize fast, high-throughput (∼second/sample), and microscaled (∼1 μL) sample analysis in human urine without any enrichment or purification. On-chip urine fingerprints further allow for differentiation between kidney stone patients and healthy controls. Discussion: Given the fast, high throughput, and easy operation, our approach brings a new dimension to designing nano-material-based chips for high-performance metabolic analysis and large-scale diagnostic use.

	abstract = {Fosfomycin is an old antibacterial agent, which is currently used mainly in human medicine, in uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs). The purpose of this review is to investigate the presence and the characteristics of Fosfomycin resistance in bacteria isolated from canine or feline samples, estimate the possible causes of the dissemination of associated strains in pets, and underline the requirements of prospective relevant studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search of current literature in two databases. A total of 33 articles were finally included in the review. Relevant data were tracked down, assembled, and compared. Referring to the geographical distribution, Northeast Asia was the main area of origin of the studies. E. coli was the predominant species detected, followed by other Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococci, and Pseudomonas spp. FosA and fosA3 were the more frequently encountered Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARGs) in the related Gram-negative isolates, while fosB was regularly encountered in Gram-positive ones. The majority of the strains were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and co-carried resistance genes against several classes of antibiotics and especially β-Lactams, such as blaCTX-M and mecA. These results demonstrate the fact that the cause of the spreading of Fosfomycin-resistant bacteria among pets could be the extended use of other antibacterial agents, that promote the prevalence of MDR, epidemic strains among an animal population. Through the circulation of these strains into a community, a public health issue could arise. Further research is essential though, for the comprehensive consideration of the issue, as the current data are limited. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Pharmaceutical active compounds (PhACs) are emerging contaminants that pose a growing concern due to their ubiquitous presence and harmful impact on aquatic ecosystems. Among PhACs, the anti-inflammatory ibuprofen (IBU) and the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) are two of the most used compounds whose presence has been reported in different aquatic environments worldwide. However, there is still scarce information about the cellular and molecular alterations provoked by IBU and OTC on aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms as microalgae, even more if we refer to their potential combined toxicity. To test the cyto- and genotoxicity provoked by IBU, OTC and their binary combination on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a flow cytometric panel was performed after 24 h of single and co-exposure to both contaminants. Assayed parameters were cell vitality, metabolic activity, intracellular ROS levels, and other programmed cell death (PCD)-related biomarkers as cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potentials and caspase-like and endonuclease activities. In addition, a nuclear DNA fragmentation analysis by comet assay was carried out. For most of the parameters analysed (vitality, metabolic activity, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potentials, and DNA fragmentation) the most severe damages were observed in the cultures exposed to the binary mixture (IBU+OTC), showing a joint cyto- and genotoxicity effect. Both PhACs and their mixture caused a remarkable decrease in cell proliferation and metabolic activity and markedly increased intracellular ROS levels, parallel to a noticeable depolarization of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, a strong increase in both caspase and endonuclease activities as well as a PCD-related loss of nuclear DNA integrity was observed in all treatments. Results analysis showed that the PhACs caused cell death on this non-target organism, involving mitochondrial membrane depolarization, enhanced ROS production and activation of PCD process. Thus, PCD should be an applicable toxicological target for unraveling the harmful effects of co-exposure to PhACs in aquatic organisms as microalgae. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Hydrogen is one of the most promising renewable energies that has been observing rapid development over the past years. Recent accidental explosion incidents and the associated damages have demonstrated the importance of hydrogen safety against potential explosions. This article presents a systematic review on hydrogen explosions. Potential explosion scenarios including the existence of impurities and rich-oxygen environment in the production, storage with extreme-high pressure and ultra-low temperature, transportation, and consumption processes are reviewed. Different types of hydrogen-air cloud explosion include expansion and deflagration, detonation, and deflagration-to-detonation transition (DDT). Existing studies on hydrogen explosion covering laboratory and field blasting test, numerical simulation utilizing various computational approaches, and theoretical derivation are reviewed and summarized. CFD modeling is currently one of the main research methods because of its cost effectiveness, though challenges existing in simulation hydrogen-air cloud detonation comparing with testing results. Apart from the properties of hydrogen-air cloud such as concentration, size and heterogeneity, environmental factors such as ignition, ventilation and obstacle are found to strongly influence the loading characteristics of hydrogen-air cloud explosion. Existing prediction approaches for estimating blast loading from hydrogen-air cloud explosion including the TNT equivalent method (TNT-EM), TNO multi-energy method (TNO MEM), and Baker-Strehlow-Tang method (BST) are primarily empirical based. Because of the inherited difference of hydrogen-air cloud from solid explosives and conventional flammable gases, the accuracies of these approaches are still doubtable, which requires further study. © 2022 Hydrogen Energy Publications LLC},

	abstract = {Background: Epidemiologic studies of serum per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and antibody response to vaccines have suggested an adverse association, but the consistency and magnitude of this association remain unclear. Objective: The goal of this systematic review was to determine the size of the association between a doubling in perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) serum concentration and difference in loge antibody concentration following a vaccine, with a focus on five PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). Data source: We conducted online searches of PubMed and Web of Science through May 17, 2022 and identified 14 eligible reports published from 2012 to 2022. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: We included studies conducted in humans, including mother–child pairs, which examined serum PFAS concentration in relation to serum concentration of antibody to a specific antigen following a vaccine. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: We used the risk of bias assessment for non-randomized studies of exposure and certainty assessment method proposed by Morgan et al. (2019). Using a multilevel meta-regression model, we quantitatively synthesized the data. Results: The 14 reports represented 13 unique groups of subjects; the frequency of studies of a given antibody was Tetanus (n = 7); followed by Diphtheria (6); Measles (4); Rubella (3); Haemophilus influenzae type b and Influenza A H1N1 (2 each); and Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Influenza A H2N3, Influenza B, and Mumps (1 each). There were approximately 4,830 unique participants included in the analyses across the 14 reports. The models of coefficients between antibody concentration and the five principal PFAS showed homogeneity of associations across antibody types for each principal PFAS. In the models with all antibodies treated as one type, evidence of effect modification by life stage was present for PFOA and PFOS, and for consistency, all associations were evaluated for all ages and for children. The summary associations (coefficients for difference in loge[antibody concentration] per doubling of serum PFAS) with 95% confidence intervals that excluded zero (“statistical support”), and certainty of evidence ratings were as follows: for PFOA and all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, −0.06 (-0.10, −0.01; moderate) and in children, −0.10 (-0.16, −0.03; moderate); for Diphtheria in children, −0.12 (-0.23, −0.00; high); for Rubella in all ages, −0.09 (-0.17, −0.01; moderate), and for Tetanus in children, −0.12 (-0.24, −0.00; moderate). For PFOS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, −0.06 (-0.11, −0.01; moderate) and in children, −0.10 (-0.18, −0.03; moderate); for Rubella in all ages, −0.09 (-0.15, −0.03; high) and in children, −0.12 (-0.20, −0.04; high). For PFHxS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, −0.03 (-0.06, −0.00; moderate) and in children, −0.05 (-0.09, −0.00; low); and for Rubella in children, −0.07 (-0.11, −0.02; high). Summary associations for PFNA and PFDA did not have statistical support, but all PFAS studied tended to have an inverse association with antibody concentrations. Limitations and conclusions: Epidemiologic data on immunosuppression and five principal PFAS suggest an association, with support across antibodies against multiple types of antigens. Data on Diphtheria, Rubella, and Tetanus were more supportive of an association than for other antibodies, and support was greater for associations with PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, than for PFNA or PFDA. The data on any specific antibody were scarce. Confounding factors that might account for the relation were not identified.

	abstract = {The vitreous humour is a gel-like structure that composes the majority of each eye. It functions to provide passage of light, be a viscoelastic dampener, and hold the retina in place. Vitreous liquefaction causes retinal detachment and retinal tears requiring pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous substitution. An ideal vitreous substitute should display similar mechanical, chemical, and rheological properties to the natural vitreous. Currently used vitreous substitutes such as silicone oil, perfluorocarbon liquids, and gases cannot be used long-term due to adverse effects such as poor retention time, cytotoxicity, and cataract formation. Long-term, experimental vitreous substitutes composed of natural, modified and synthetic polymers are currently being studied. This review discusses current long- and short-term vitreous substitutes and the disadvantages of these that have highlighted the need for an ideal vitreous substitute. The review subsequently focuses specifically on currently used polysaccharide- and synthetic polymer-based vitreous substitutes, which may be modified or functionalised, or employed as the derivative, and discusses experimental vitreous substitutes in these classes. The advantages and challenges associated with the use of polymeric substitutes are discussed. Innovative approaches to vitreous substitution, namely a novel foldable capsular vitreous body, are presented, as well as future perspectives related to the advancement of this field. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Simultaneous removal of nitrogen, phosphate and emerging pollutants are critical for safe reuse of wastewater, but research in this field is limited. In the present study, a novel aerobic denitrifying phosphate-accumulating bacterial strain RL-GZ01 was found to be able to utilize phthalic acid esters (PAEs) as carbon resource for cell growth. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, physiological and biochemical characterization, and genome-based average nucleotide identity calculation, RL-GZ01 was identified as Rhodococcus pyridinivorans. Strain RL-GZ01 showed high DEHP degradation in alkaline conditions and good tolerance of salinity and organic solvents. The degradation of DEHP by RL-GZ01 fitted well with a modified Gompertz model (R2 = 0.9985). Metabolic intermediates of DEHP were identified via UHPLC-MS/MS analysis and the catabolic pathway was proposed thereafter. Genes and gene clusters contributed to the utilization of DEHP were analyzed through genomic analysis. Analysis of KEGG nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated that nitrate and nitrite were further transformed into ammonium which was further used for the biosynthesis of L-glutamine and L-glutamate. Strain RL-GZ01 was further identified as a denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism which can accumulate phosphate by generating polyphosphate. Finally, strain RL-GZ01 was applied to municipal wastewater treatment for simultaneous removal of nitrogen, phosphate and DEHP. The removal percentages of DEHP (5 mg/L), TN (71.2 mg/L), NH4+-N (70.9 mg/L), PO43−-P (10.89 mg/L) and COD (622.4 mg/L) by strain RL-GZ01 were 89.94 %, 64.45 %, 64.94 %, 76.30 % and 63.23 % within 84 h, respectively. These demonstrated the capability of strain RL-GZ01 for the biological treatment of wastewater containing PAEs. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background and aims Greenhouse gases (GHGs) that trap heat in the atmosphere are composed of carbon dioxide (CO 2), methane, nitrous oxide and fluorinated gases (synthetic hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and nitrogen trifluoride). In the USA, the health sector accounts for 8.5% of total GHG emissions. The primary objective of this systematic review was to critically analyse the carbon emissions data from GI endoscopic activity. Design The GI endoscopy carbon cycle was evaluated at preprocedural, intraprocedural and postprocedural levels. We performed a systematic literature search of articles published on these issues until 30 June 2022 and discussed these available data on endoscopy unit GHG carbon cycle, barriers to reduce GHG emissions and potential solutions. The inclusion criteria were any full-text articles (observational, clinical trials, brief communications, case series and editorials) reporting waste generation from GI endoscopy. Abstracts, news articles and conference proceedings were excluded. Results Our search yielded 393 records in PubMed, 1708 in Embase and 24 in Google Scholar. After application of inclusion and exclusion factors, we focused on 9 fulllength articles in detail, only 3 of them were cross-sectional studies (all from the USA), the others reviews or position statements. Therefore, the quality of the studies could not be assessed due to heterogeneity in definitions and amount of emissions. Conclusions Recognition of carbon emissions generated by GI endoscopy activity is critical. Although multiple limitations exists for quantification of these emission, there is an urgent need for collecting proper data as well as examining novel methods for reduction of these emissions for a sustainable endoscopic practices in the future.  © 2023 Authors.

	abstract = {Objectives: High prevalence of risk factors for pelvic floor disorders (PFD) in the Eastern Mediterranean may result in higher rates of prevalence of PFD in comparison to other regions. Despite individual studies, there are no clear statistics on the cumulative prevalence of PFDs in the East Mediterranean region. The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of PFDs in the Eastern Mediterranean region. Methods: A literature search without language restriction was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane database and Web of Science from 2016 to 01 June 2022. Cross-sectional and cohort studies that reported prevalence of urinary incontinence (UI), constipation, fecal incontinence (FI) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) among women in the Eastern Mediterranean region were included. Study quality was assessed according to the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal tool. Data were pooled and meta-analysed using a random effects model. PROSPERO: CRD42021283127 Results: The search yielded 390 articles, from which 12 studies containing 9905 patients were included. Five studies were high quality and seven were low quality. The prevalence of POP (12 studies, 9905 participants), UI (5 studies, 2340 participants), constipation (4 studies, 2045 participants) and FI (1 study, 166 participants) was 39% (95% CI 21-57; I2 99.8%), 48% (95% CI 16-80; I2 99.7%), 39% (CI 17-60; I2 99.1%) and 14% (95% CI 9-20) respectively. Conclusion: In meta-analysis pooling studies of mixed quality, a high prevalence of PFDs was seen in the Eastern Mediterranean region.

	abstract = {(1) Introduction: Erdheim–Chester disease (ECD) is a life-threatening condition and often a diagnostic challenge. It has recently been classified as a hematopoietic tumour, and the cases of ECD reported in the literature has dramatically increased during the last 15 years. (2) Methods: We describe the case of a 57-year-old male patient with severe gynecomastia, with a detailed description of his diagnostic iter and consequent surgical operation. We provide the first systematic review of the literature of breast involvement in ECD, following PRISMA guidelines, including 13 studies and 16 patients. (3) Results: Our report resulted to be the first case of gynecomastia as a single clinical and imaging feature of ECD described in English literature. A total of 81.3% of patients included were female. Among them, 76.9% had unilateral and nodular presentation, while male patients presented bilateral heterogeneous breast enlargement. Globally, 87.5% expressed breast alterations as their first manifestations of ECD. Only 50% presented skeletal involvement. (4) Conclusion: The reported case represents a unique addition to the literature. We found two different patterns in ECD-related breast involvement between male and female patients, an unusual M/F ratio, and a lower rate of bone involvement. Breast involvement is frequently the first clinical feature; therefore, breast caregivers should be aware of this dangerous and most likely underestimated condition. © 2023 by the authors.},

The structural, morphological and elemental observations of synthesised photocatalyst have been characterized using X-ray diffraction (XRD), FTIR, UV-DRS, SEM with EDX and HRTEM analysis. Incorporation of metal ions into ZnO lattice caused a red shift in the absorption band thus extending its absorption towards visible region through inhibition of electron hole recombination reaction and through the property of surface plasmon resonance (SPR). However the addition of silver and nickel ions has modified the electronic and optical properties of the photocatalyst thus improving the photocatalytic performance of the sample. The photocatalytic performance of Ag, Ni-codoped ZnO nanoparticles have been tested for degradation of Direct Red 81 dye (DR-81), as pollutant in aqueous solution. Under the optimum conditions (20 ppm dye and 10 mg/L photocatalyst), complete mineralization of dye solution under study was achieved within 40min of time duration. The Ag, Ni-codoped ZnO photocatalyst is thermally stable and efficient for five successive consecutive runs thus retaining its efficiency towards degradation. The overall results thus obtained have suggested that a suitable method for the detoxification of environmental pollutants emerging from industries. © 2023, National Institute of Science Communication and Policy Research.

	abstract = {Pollution is one of the most relevant issues for the conservation of freshwater environments. Fishes are the main group of organisms studied in aquatic toxicology, and their behaviours, including feeding, courtship, parental care, and territoriality, are essential to their health. Cichlids are one of the most abundant fish families and are both economically and ecologically relevant. In this review, we found that metals, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and endocrine disruptor chemicals are the main groups of pollutants that have been studied in the context of cichlid behaviour. African tilapias are the most evaluated cichlids on this topic, and Nile tilapia was the most frequently studied species. Exposure to these pollutants has been shown to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming, activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances, and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods. It is also important to consider more pollutants—both individually and in combination—such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and microplastics, due the increasing relevance of these pollutants of emerging concern. In line with this, cichlid fish species with reduced native distributions are suitable study species to provide information for the conservation of freshwater environments. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {The impact of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances on microbial communities is challenging to investigate in situ because of the complexity and dynamics of natural ecosystems. In the present study, four microcosms were established to explore the impact of perfluorooctanoate (PFOA) on bacterial communities in riverine and marine settings. PFOA distribution between the aqueous and sedimentary phases fluctuated in both PFOA-amended and unamended control systems. PFOA was more rapidly partitioned into the sediment in marine than in riverine microcosms. Differences in iron concentration and salinity may influence PFOA exchange between water and sediment. In marine microcosms, the alpha diversity of bacterial communities was significantly correlated to PFOA concentration. PFOA tended to correlate more strongly with bacterial community composition in water than in sediment. At the whole system level, Lefse's analysis indicated Algoriphagus halophilus as biomarkers for PFOA exposure in both riverine and marine systems, and the family Flavobacteriaceae were also more abundant in the exposed systems. In terms of temporal variation (comparison between three time points in the systems), metastat analysis showed great variability of potential PFOA-sensitive bacteria at the genus level. As such, most PFOA-sensitive genera were transitory and variable and existed for a short term in different systems (river, sea, blank, and experiment) and phases. Compared with other PFOA-sensitive genera, we suggest that further research is carried out to explore the use of Limnobacter as a bioindicator for temporal monitoring of PFOA pollution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Particulate matter (PM) is one of the essential environmental stressors for the poultry industry in the world. Given its large specific surface area, PM can adsorb and carry a variety of pollutants, including heavy metal ions, ammonia, and persistent organic pollutants such as pathogenic microorganisms. High concentrations of PM induce poultry respiratory inflammation and trigger various diseases. However, the pathogenic mechanism of PM in poultry houses on respiratory diseases has not been clarified due to its complexity and lack of accurate assays. In terms of pathogenesis, there are 3 ways to explain this phenomenon: Inhaled PM irritates the respiratory tract, decreases immune resistance, and causes a respiratory disease; respiratory tract irritation by compounds presents in PM; infections with pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms attached to PM. The latter 2 modes of influence are more harmful. Specifically, PM can induce the respiratory disease through several toxic mechanisms, including ammonia ingestion and bioaccumulation, lung flora dysbiosis, oxidative stress, and metabolic disorders. Therefore, this review summarizes the characteristics of PM in the poultry house and the impact of poultry PM on respiratory disease and proposes potential pathogenic mechanisms. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: The prevalence of wheeze and asthma has risen over recent decades for all age groups, especially children. These disorders can lead to decreased quality of life, missed school, urgent care and emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and increased health care costs. Environmental exposures, including pesticide exposure, are likely a contributing factor to this increased prevalence. Objective: To evaluate the association of pesticide exposure with childhood wheeze and asthma. Methods: We conducted a systematic review evaluating studies of pesticide exposure (measured objectively) and child respiratory outcomes. We searched PubMed, Embase (Elsevier), CINAHL (EBSCO), Scopus (Elsevier), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Wiley), and ClinicalTri-als.gov from 1988-2021. Main search keywords included “pesticides”, “insecticides”, “herbi-cides”, “respiratory”, “asthma” and “wheeze”. Results: Out of 5767 studies, 25 met the inclusion criteria; eight evaluated prenatal pesticide exposure (n=8407), twelve evaluated postnatal exposures (n= 50,488), and five evaluated pre-and postnatal exposures (n=20,919). Main pesticides investigated were dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) (14 studies) followed by organophosphates (7 studies). Primary methods of outcome assessment were questionnaire-based (84%), followed by spirometry (16%), registry data, and blood measures. Studies varied in the strength of evidence relating to study design and measures. Most studies (84%) reported a positive association of exposure with adverse child respiratory health. Conclusion: The studies suggest an association of pesticide exposure and childhood wheeze and asthma. The varying results and methods reinforce the need for more research and standardized approaches to these studies to confirm the suggested association of pesticide exposure and childhood wheeze and asthma. © 2023 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Cost-effective methods for the removal of water pollutants are emerging as an urgent need of the hour owing to the release of a huge number of toxic materials into the water bodies. Pollution from toxic synthetic chemicals, heavy metals, pesticides, herbicides, fertilizers, pharmaceutical substances etc. adversely affect aquatic ecosystem. It also make the polluted water unusable for human contact or consumption. Pollution from heavy metal namely, arsenic, cadmium, nickel, mercury, chromium, zinc, lead etc. is becoming a major health risk. Many diseases like gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders, skin lesions, vascular damage, immune system dysfunction, birth defects, and cancer are associated with heavy metal poisoning. Adsorption-based methods are highly popular and advantageous because of their low cost, high retention time, and good recyclability. Carbon dots are emerging as green adsorbents of recent times for various categories of water contaminants including heavy metals. The use of bio sources as a green precursor to carbon dot synthesis is opening a huge opportunity to fabricate inexpensive materials for heavy metal remediation in the future. With very high surface functionalities and large speific surface area, the adsorption of heavy metals as high as 2000 mg g−1 is achievable. In this review, recent development about the use of carbon dot-composites with materials such as biopolymers, zeolites, layered double hydroxides, spinels and metal-organic frameworks has been discussed. Such matrix enhance the water stability of the carbon dots as well as synergistically improve the kinetics and thermodynamics of the interaction process making it an efficient material for heavy metal remediation. The review discusses the synthesis protocols of fabricating different carbon dot composites. It lists the various advantages of carbon dot-composite over other materials used for heavy metal remediation viz. low-cost as most of them are synthesized from biomass. Hence, they are biogenic, possessing many functional moieties making them efficient and eco-friendly in the removal of heavy metals. In addition, the review lists many advantages associated with green carbon dot based composites like methods of regeneration and reusability. In a nutshell, carbon dot based composites are wonderful sustainable material rendering an ideal approach for heavy metal remediation. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {In plant biology, metabolomics is often used to quantitatively assess small molecules, metabolites, and their intermediates in plants. Metabolomics has frequently been applied to detect metabolic alterations in plants exposed to various biotic and abiotic stresses, including pesticides. The widespread use of pesticides and agrochemicals in intensive crop production systems is a serious threat to the functionality and sustainability of agroecosystems. Pesticide accumulation in soil may disrupt soil–plant relationships, thereby posing a pollution risk to agricultural output. Application of metabolomic techniques in the assessment of the biological consequences of pesticides at the molecular level has emerged as a crucial technique in exposome investigations. State-of-the-art metabolomic approaches such as GC–MS, LC–MS/MS UHPLC, UPLC–IMS–QToF, GC/EI/MS, MALDI-TOF MS, and 1H-HR-MAS NMR, etc., investigating the harmful effects of agricultural pesticides have been reviewed. This updated review seeks to outline the key uses of metabolomics related to the evaluation of the toxicological impacts of pesticides on agronomically important crops in exposome assays as well as bench-scale studies. Overall, this review describes the potential uses of metabolomics as a method for evaluating the safety of agricultural chemicals for regulatory applications. Additionally, the most recent developments in metabolomic tools applied to pesticide toxicology and also the difficulties in utilizing this approach are discussed. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In vivo, in vitro, and epidemiological evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) may alter thyroid function in human health, with negative effects on maternal and fetal development outcomes. However, data on the effects of PFAS on thyroid hormones remain controversial. Here, we conducted a meta-analysis of 13 eligible studies searched from Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science by July 10, 2022, to explore the relationship between maternal exposure to PFAS and thyroid health effects, including thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), triiodothyronine (TT3), thyroxin (TT4), free T3 (FT3), and free T4 (FT4). The estimated values (β) and the corresponding confidence intervals (95%CI) were extracted for analysis. The tests for heterogeneity, sensitivity and publication bias between studies were performed using Stata 15.0. The combined results showed a positive association between changes in TSH and exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), with no significant correlation observed between changes in other thyroid hormones and exposure to PFAS. This difference was attributed to sample size, region, sample type, body mass index (BMI), and gestational week. Our data recommend verifying the relationship between PFAS exposure and thyroid health effects in a large sample population cohort in future studies. In addition, health care should be taken into account in early and mid-pregnancy. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Although microplastics are emerging marine pollutants that have recently attracted increasing attention, it is still difficult to identify their sources. This study reviewed 6487 articles to determine current research trends and found 237 effective concentration points after sorting, which were distributed in four regions and related to freshwater ecosystems. Results found that 15 environmental variables represented natural and anthropogenic environmental characteristics, of which seven environmental variables were selected for experimental modelling. Random forest models fitted sample data, thus facilitating the identification of regional microplastics distribution. The global random forest model had random forest importance scores (RFISs) for gross domestic product, population, and the proportion of agricultural land use were 15.76 %, 15.64 %, and 14.74 %, respectively; these indicate that human activities significantly affected the global distribution of microplastics. In Asia, agriculture and urban activities are the main sources of microplastics, with an RFIS of 11.58 % and 12.24 % for the proportion of agricultural and urban land use, respectively. Activities in urban areas were determined to be the main influencing factors in North America, with an RFIS of 13.92 % for the proportion of urban land use. Agricultural activities were the main influencing factors in Europe, with RFISs for the proportion of agricultural land use of 16.90 %. Our results indicate that region-specific policies are required to control microplastics in different regions, with soil composition being a latency factor that affects microplastics' distribution. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

Experimental and epidemiological studies have shown potential links between exposure to environmental toxicants and poor male fertility. Some environmental exposures in utero can disrupt fetal testicular function and result in cryptorchidism, low semen quality, low serum testosterone levels, and low fertility. Environmental exposure in childhood and adulthood can also adversely affect germ cells, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, or the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, resulting in impaired male fertility. In this review, we report the latest results from human studies that investigated the role of endocrine disrupting chemicals, heavy metals, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and use of marijuana in low semen quality and impaired male fertility. Current evidence suggests the relationship between these environmental factors and low male fertility; however, some factors showed conflicting results which need further investigation. © 2023 The Authors},

	abstract = {Microplastics, defined as particles <5 mm in diameter, are emerging environmental pollutants that pose a threat to ecosystems and human health. Biofilm degradation of microplastics may be an ecologically friendly approach. This review systematically summarises the factors affecting biofilm degradation of microplastics and proposes feasible methods to improve the efficiency of microplastic biofilm degradation. Environmentally insensitive microorganisms were screened, optimized, and commercially cultured to facilitate the practical application of this technology. For strain screening, technology should focus on microorganisms/strains that can modify the hydrophobicity of microplastics, degrade the crystalline zone of microplastics, and metabolise additives in microplastics. The biodegradation mechanism is also described; microorganisms secreting extracellular oxidases and hydrolases are key factors for degradation. Measuring the changes in molecular weight distribution (MWD) enables better analysis of the biodegradation behaviour of microplastics. Biofilm degradation of microplastics has relatively few applications because of its low efficiency; however, enrichment of microplastics in freshwater environments and wastewater treatment plant tailwater is currently the most effective method for treating microplastics with biofilms. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Plastic pollution has become one of the most serious environmental problems, and microplastics (MPs, particles < 5 mm size) may behave as a vehicle of organic pollutants, causing detrimental effects to the environment. Studies on MP-sorbed organic pollutants lack methodological standardization, resulting in a low comparability and replicability. In this work, we reviewed 40 field studies of MP-sorbed organic contaminants using PRISMA guidelines for acquiring information on sampling and analytical protocols. The papers were also scored for their reliability on the basis of 7 criteria, from 0 (minimum) to 21 (maximum). Our results showed a great heterogeneity of the methods used for the sample collection, MPs extraction, and instruments for chemicals’ identification. Measures for cross-contamination control during MPs analysis were strictly applied only in 13% of the studies, indicating a need for quality control in MPs-related research. The most frequently detected MP-sorbed chemicals were polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Most of the studies showed a good reliability (>75% of the total score), with 32 papers scoring 16 or higher. On the basis of the collected information, a standardizable protocol for the detection of MPs and MP-sorbed chemicals has been suggested for improving the reliability of MPs monitoring studies. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Atherogenesis involves a complex multifactorial process including chronic inflammation that requires the participation of several cell types and molecules. In addition to their role in vascular homeostasis, extracellular vesicles also appear to play an important role in atherogenesis, including monocyte transmigration and foam cell formation, SMC proliferation and migration, leukocyte transmigration, and thrombosis. Peripheral arterial disease, a major form of peripheral vascular disease, is characterized by structural or functional impairment of peripheral arterial supply, often secondary to atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of extracellular vesicles have been demonstrated in patients with peripheral arterial disease and implicated in the development of atherosclerosis within peripheral vascular beds. However, extracellular vesicles also appear capable of delivering cargo with atheroprotective effects. This capability has been exploited in vesicles engineered to carry content capable of neovascularization, suggesting potential for therapeutic angiogenesis. This dual capacity holds substantial promise for diagnosis and therapy, including possibly limb- and life-saving options for peripheral arterial disease management. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Management of central nervous system (CNS) metastases from epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC) is an unmet need. We analyzed data on 41 such patients to evaluate predictors of outcome. Between January, 2010 and December 2020, among 1028 patients with EOC treated at our institute 41 (3.98%) developed CNS metastasis. Median age of patients was 48 years, ranging from 22 to 75 years. Primary outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS), and analysis of prognostic factors were secondary outcome measures. An intention to treat analysis was done. We also performed review the literature (n=2253) as regards to clinicopathological and radiological features, treatment received, survival outcomes and prognostic factors. Median time from diagnosis of EOC to CNS metastasis was 27 months (range: 0 to 101 months). 33(80.5%) patients had FIGO stage III-IV at baseline and serous carcinoma (75.6%) was common pathology subtype. Thirteen (31.7%) patients had isolated CNS metastasis and 28 (68.3%) had intra-abdominal disease in addition. Nineteen (46.3%) patients achieved complete response post treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Median PFS and OS from the time of CNS metastasis is 12 (range:1 to 51) months and 33 (range: 1 to 71) months, respectively. Absence of extracranial disease and lower serum CA-125 at diagnosis of CNS metastasis were predictive of superior PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. CNS metastasis is a late event in EOC, post multiple lines of treatment. Patients with disease limited to brain and treated with surgical resection and chemoradiation have best outcome. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background: The aim of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA) versus dynamic hip screw (DHS) for the treatment of unstable intertrochanteric fractures, including the available evidence drawn from the literature. Methods: A systematic search was conducted to identify available and relevant randomized controlled trials and retrospective comparative observational studies regarding PFNA compared against DHS in treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures in Embase, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, and Scopus Online up to February 12, 2022. Data from the included studies were extracted independently by 2 reviewers and analyzed using RevMan 5.3, and the quality of the studies was assessed. Results: Five randomized controlled trials and 12 observational studies were recruited and met the inclusion criteria, which consisted of 1332 patients with PFNA and 1271 patients with DHS. The results of the meta-analysis showed that, compared with the DHS, PFNA exhibited a beneficial role in postoperative Harris Hip Scores, operation time, intraoperative blood loss, length of hospital stay, fracture healing time and full weight-bearing time, limb shortening, cutout, reoperation, union problems, the varus collapse of the femoral head/neck, and infection; however, DHS was superior to PFNA in hidden blood loss (relative risk [RR] = 139.81, 95% confidence interval [CI] [136.18, 143.43], P <.00001), postoperation drainage (RR = -17.85, 95% CI [-30.10, -5.60], P =.004), total blood loss (RR = 50.34, 95% CI [42.99, 57.69], P <.00001), and femoral shaft fracture (RR = 4.72, 95% CI [1.15, 19.32], P =.03) treated by DHS were significantly decreased, compared with those by PFNA; however, no significant differences were observed in tip-apex distance, fixation failures, screw migration, or other complicants between the 2 surgical methods. Conclusion: Analysis of a large number of relevant clinical indicators available shows that PFNA has better clinical manifestation than DHS in treating unstable femoral intertrochanteric fractures. © 2023 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Background: Esophageal cancer (EC) is the 6th leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and the morbidity and mortality of EC have continued to increase in recent years. The results of the clinical application of the Fast-track recovery surgery (FTS) concept in nursing interventions for EC patients after total endoscopic esophagectomy are unconvincing. This study sought to evaluate the nursing effect of the fast-track recovery surgical nursing model on patients with EC after total cavity endoscopic esophagectomy. Methods: We searched for articles on case-control trials about nursing interventions after total endoscopic esophagectomy. The search time was set from January 2010 to May 2022. The data were independently extracted by 2 researchers. RevMan5.3 statistical software (Cochrane) was used to analyze the extracted data. All the articles included in the review were assessed for risk of bias using the Cochrane Handbook 5.3 (https://training.cochrane.org/). Results: Ultimately, 8 clinical controlled trials, comprising 613 cases, were identified. A meta-analysis was conducted of the extubation times, and the results showed that the study group’s extubation times were remarkably shorter. In relation to the exhaust times, the study group had significantly shorter exhaust times than control group (P<0.05). In relation to the time, it took patients to leave bed, patients in the study group left bed in a considerably shorter time compared with controls (P<0.00001). In relation to the hospitalization time, a remarkable reduction in the length of hospital stay was observed in the study group (P<0.00001). The analysis of the funnel plots showed a small number of asymmetries, suggesting that the number of articles included was small due to the heterogeneity of the studies (P<0.00001). Conclusions: FTS care is effective at accelerating patients’ postoperative recovery. This model of care needs to be further validated in the future by higher-quality and longer follow-up studies. © Journal of Gastrointestinal Oncology. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Electrokinetic-enhanced bioremediation (EK-Bio), particularly bioaugmentation with injection of biodehalogenation functional microbes such as Dehalococcoides, has been documented to be effective in treating a low-permeability subsurface matrix contaminated with chlorinated ethenes. However, the spatio-temporal variations of indigenous microbial community and biodehalogenation activity of the background matrix, a fundamental aspect for understanding EK-Bio, remain unclear. To fill this gap, we investigated the variation of trichloroethylene (TCE) biodehalogenation activity in response to indigenous microbial community succession in EK-Bio by both column and batch experiments. For a 195 day EK-Bio column (∼1 V/cm, electrolyte circulation, lactate addition), biodehalogenation activity occurred first near the cathode (<60 days) and then spread to the anode (>90 days), which was controlled by electron acceptor (i.e., Fe(III)) competition and microbe succession. Amplicon sequencing and metagenome analysis revealed that iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter, Anaeromyxobacter, Geothrix) were enriched within initial 60 d and were gradually replaced by organohalide-respiring bacteria (versatile Geobacter and obligate Dehalobacter) afterward. Iron-reducing bacteria required an initial long time to consume the competitive electron acceptors so that an appropriate reductive condition could be developed for the enrichment of organohalide-respiring bacteria and the enhancement of TCE biodehalogenation activity. © 2023 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widespread pollutants that may impact youth adiposity patterns. We investigated cross-sectional associations between PFAS and body mass index (BMI) in teenagers/adolescents across nine European countries within the Human Biomonitoring for Europe (HBM4EU) initiative. We used data from 1957 teenagers (12–18 yrs) that were part of the HBM4EU aligned studies, consisting of nine HBM studies (NEBII, Norway; Riksmaten Adolescents 2016–17, Sweden; PCB cohort (follow-up), Slovakia; SLO CRP, Slovenia; CROME, Greece; BEA, Spain; ESTEBAN, France; FLEHS IV, Belgium; GerES V-sub, Germany). Twelve PFAS were measured in blood, whilst weight and height were measured by field nurse/physician or self-reported in questionnaires. We assessed associations between PFAS and age- and sex-adjusted BMI z-scores using linear and logistic regression adjusted for potential confounders. Random-effects meta-analysis and mixed effects models were used to pool studies. We assessed mixture effects using molar sums of exposure biomarkers with toxicological/structural similarities and quantile g-computation. In all studies, the highest concentrations of PFAS were PFOS (medians ranging from 1.34 to 2.79 μg/L). There was a tendency for negative associations with BMI z-scores for all PFAS (except for PFHxS and PFHpS), which was borderline significant for the molar sum of [PFOA and PFNA] and significant for single PFOA [β-coefficient (95% CI) per interquartile range fold change = −0.06 (−0.17, 0.00) and −0.08 (−0.15, −0.01), respectively]. Mixture assessment indicated similar negative associations of the total mixture of [PFOA, PFNA, PFHxS and PFOS] with BMI z-score, but not all compounds showed associations in the same direction: whilst [PFOA, PFNA and PFOS] were negatively associated, [PFHxS] associated positively with BMI z-score. Our results indicated a tendency for associations of relatively low PFAS concentrations with lower BMI in European teenagers. More prospective research is needed to investigate this potential relationship and its implications for health later in life. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Micro/nanoplastics (MPs/NPs) are ubiquitous in the environment and living organisms have been exposed to these substances for a long time. When MPs/NPs enter different organisms, they transport various pollutants, including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, drugs, bacteria, and viruses, from the environment. On this basis, this paper summarizes the combined toxicity induced by MPs/NPs accumulating contaminants from the environment and entering organisms through a systematic review of 162 articles. Moreover, the factors influencing toxic interactions are critically discussed, thus highlighting the dominant role of the relative concentrations of contaminants in the combined toxic effects. Furthermore, for the first time, we describe the threats posed by MPs/NPs combined with other pollutants to human health, as well as their cytotoxic behavior and mechanism. We found that the “Trojan horse” effect of nanoplastics can increase the bioaccessibility of environmental pollutants, thus increasing the carcinogenic risk to humans. Simultaneously, the complex pollutants entering the cells are observed to be constantly dissociated due to the transport of lysosomes. However, current research on the intracellular release of MP/NP-loaded pollutants is relatively poor, which hinders the accurate in vivo toxicity assessment of combined pollutants. Based on the findings of our critical review, we recommend analyzing the toxic effects by clarifying the dose relationship of each component pollutant in cells, which is challenging yet crucial to exploring the toxic mechanism of combined pollution. In the future, our findings can contribute to establishing a system modeling the complete load-translocation toxicological mechanism of MP/NP-based composite pollutants. © 2022 The Author(s)},

Catalytic degradation using single-atom catalysts (SACs) is emerging as a promising technology for COPs removal, accomplishing high efficiency in both aqueous and gaseous environments. This review systematically summarizes the recent development in catalytic degradation of COPs using a variety of SACs, focusing on the understanding of structure-performance relationships and key mechanisms involved. First, the SACs-promoted COPs dechlorination through the reduction process is evaluated. Second, the oxidation process for COPs degradation is presented, followed by the discussion of the synergic reduction–oxidation degradation process. Last, the existing challenges in this field and possible solutions are proposed, hoping to offer inspiration and guidance for the future applications of SACs in COPs elimination. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Directional drilling technology (DDT) originated from oil drilling industry. After many years of development, DDT has been extended to geological investigation and disaster management for tunnel engineering, aquifer reconstruction at the bottom of coal mines, pumping channel construction for power storage stations, municipal pipeline laying and other fields. Combined with the advantages of DDT for long-distance accurate crossing, ground grouting technology can achieve safe and efficient management of underground engineering disasters, and has a broad application prospect. This paper systematically reviews the development history, research status and key technologies of DDT. Firstly, the development history of DDT is introduced. Secondly, the scientific research plan, academic paper publication, relevant patent authorization, and application exploration of DDT are analysed. The analysis results show that the DDT in China has reached an internationally advanced level of technological independence and broad-range application, but there are still some core technical problems that need to be resolved, such as thousand-meter long-distance fast drilling, accurate drilling guidance in complex geological conditions, and accurate grouting in underground engineering. Focusing on the construction requirements of strategic major projects, this paper proposes four functional modules, i.e., forecasting, drilling, grouting and detecting, and analyses and discusses six aspects of ultra-long directional drilling and grouting (i.e., sensing prediction while drilling, rapid drilling and sticking prediction, precision guidance technology, remote gel controllable grouting material, pressure stabilizing and controlling sectional grouting process, and detection system with drilling). This paper can provide reference for the development of DDT, and for the prevention and control of disasters in underground engineering. © 2023 Academia Sinica. All rights reserved.},

As part of an effort to develop approaches for a complex operating site used for biocide packaging and distribution, we evaluated in vitro assays that could be used in a site management format. Across 66 studies, 108 pesticides were assessed on ten human-derived cell types at four endpoints. In vitro IC50s were compared to in vivo guidelines, NOEL/NOAELs, and ADIs using Spearman correlation and linear regression models. While human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were the most sensitive, HepG2 was the most used cell line in evaluating the toxicity of pesticides. Amongst the ten human cell lines, the IC50s derived from SH-SY5Y cells, using MTT-24 & 48 h (the most used assay) correlated (rho = 0.56–0.79; p < 0.05) with ADIs and NOEL/NOAELs. Although in vitro cell systems have some limitations, the correlation between in vitro data derived from SH-SY5Y cells and in vivo safety guidelines can provide site investigators with a tool to survey and prioritize areas and media of concern at complex operating sites impacted by pesticide mixtures. © 2022},

We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C–C and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts) affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate group). This study lays the groundwork for future research to analyze and elucidate the transformation products and pathways of PFAS in various treatment systems. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Focal therapy (FT) is a promising alternative with curative intent for Low- to Intermediate-risk localized Prostate Cancer (PCa), claiming better functional outcomes and safety profile than standard whole-gland treatments. Ten different FT modalities have been described in the literature. The objective of our narrative review is to evaluate the safety profile and functional outcomes of these different modalities and the current most used tools of assessment for those outcomes. Material and methods: Literature search was performed on 21st February 2023 using PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement (PRISMA). Articles reporting whole-gland treatments were excluded. All articles reporting functional outcomes were included. Results: One-hundred-seven studies, reporting data on 6933 patients, were included (26 on High Intensity Focal Ultrasound, 22 on Focal Cryotherapy, 14 on Irreversible Electroporation, 11 on Focal brachytherapy, 10 on Focal Laser Ablation, 8 on Photodynamic Therapy, 3 on Microwave ablation, 3 on Robotic Partial Prostatectomy, 2 on bipolar Radio Frequency Ablation, 1 on Prostatic Artery Embolization, and 7 studies comparing different FTs). Post-operative pad-free rate ranged between 92.3–100%. Greater heterogeneity exists considering the Change in Erectile Function, with Changing in Erectile function- rates ranging between 0–94.4% (Cryotherapy). The most used Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) were the International Prostate Symptom Score and the International Index of Erectile Function for incontinence/urinary function and potency, respectively. The most common reported complications were hematuria, infections, and urethral strictures, with rates widely ranging among different treatments. The Clavien–Dindo Classification was the most used (40/88 papers) to describe adverse events. Conclusion: FT is a promising treatment for localized PCa, achieving excellent results in terms of safety and functional outcomes. There is a wide heterogeneity in the definition of PROMS and time of collection between studies. High quality comparative studies with standard treatments are needed to reinforce these findings. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Limited.},

	abstract = {The aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) is a ligand-activated transcriptional factor that mediates the toxicities of several environmental pollutants. Decades of research have been carried out to understand the role of AhR as a novel mechanism for disease development. Its involvement in the pathogenesis of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, and systemic lupus erythematosus have long been known. One of the current hot research topics is investigating the role of AhR activation by environmental pollutants on glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion, and hence the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. To date, epidemiological studies have suggested that persistent exposure to environmental contaminants such as dioxins, with subsequent AhR activation increases the risk of specific comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes. The importance of AhR signaling in various molecular pathways highlights that the role of this receptor is far beyond just xenobiotic metabolism. The present review aims at providing significant insight into the physiological and pathological role of AhR and its regulated enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 1A1 (CYP1A1) and CYP1B1 in both types of diabetes. It also provides a comprehensive summary of the current findings of recent research studies investigating the role of the AhR/CYP1A1 pathway in insulin secretion and glucose hemostasis in the pancreas, liver, and adipose tissues. This review further highlights the molecular mechanisms involved, such as gluconeogenesis, hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), oxidative stress, and inflammation. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: Globally, the burden of breast cancer has increased significantly in recent decades. Emerging evidence suggested that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have the potential to interfere with the function of normal hormones, may play a crucial role in this trend. However, the potential relationships were inconsistent in various studies. Objective and search methods: In our study, we sought to fully evaluate the currently available epidemiological evidence to ascertain whether certain EDC congeners and their metabolites are related to breast cancer risk. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in three electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Publications that covered xenobiotic EDC exposures and breast cancer–confirmed histological results or antecedent medical records or reporting to health registers were taken into consideration. Outcomes: The final result of the literature search was 6,498 references, out which we found 67 publications that matched the requirements for meta-analysis and eight publications for qualitative trend synthesis. In this meta-analysis, statistically significant associations revealed that (i) 1-chloro-4-[2,2,2-trichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene (p,p'-DDT) and its major metabolite 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were somewhat related to a greater risk of breast cancer. However, this relationship only existed in blood serum but not in adipose tissue. (ii) Breast cancer risk was increased by exposure to chlordane and hexachlorocyclohexane. (iii) Five polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 99, PCB 105, PCB 118, PCB 138, and PCB 183) can increase the risk of breast cancer. (iv) One phthalate congener (BBP) and one per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance congener (PFDoDA) were negatively associated with breast cancer risk. Unfortunately, heterogeneity was not well explained in our review, and a limited number of available prospective studies investigating the associations between EDC exposure and breast cancer were included in our meta-analysis. To elucidate the overall associations, future large, longitudinal epidemiological investigations are needed.

	abstract = {Context: Humans are now exposed to a multitude of chemicals throughout the life course, some of which may affect growth and development owing to their endocrine-like activity. Objective: To assess the relationship of suspect toxicants to maturation, specifically to age at menarche. Methods: We conducted two systematic reviews of age at menarche and PFOA, PFOS, PCBs and DDE/DDT based on publications indexed by pubmed. Results: 16 unique reports were identified. Most studies of PFOA and PFOS reported either no association or delays in the age at menarche; only one reported an earlier age. Studies of DDT and DDE were more mixed. Reports on PCBs varied by PCB congener group with an equal number of them reporting delays and no association but one an acceleration. Sources of variation in results include the timing of exposure assessment (prenatal vs. postnatal), level of the toxicant, and sample size. No obvious pattern to the variation in results could be tied to those sources of variation. Conclusion: The absence of consistent evidence from multiple reports of earlier age at menarche suggests that these toxicants may not be responsible for accelerated sexual maturation in girls. However, human populations naturally vary in the variety and levels of exposure, making the comparison of studies difficult. Further, studies vary in methodology, complicating aggregation of results and generalisations. © 2023 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

Highly differentiated cells and multiple hormonal and molecular pathways are involved in this remodeling process that is unavoidably affected by normal aging. Apart from aging, several factors such as geographic variation, climate conditions, nutritional status, socioeconomic status, culture, pollution, and endocrine disruptors have been suggested to have a direct or indirect impact on bone metabolism and influence bone health. Τhe positive or negative effect of each one of these factors on bone health depends on many variables such as age of exposure, duration of exposure, and intensity of exposure but also on the combined effects of other cofactors. The pathogenetic mechanisms and the molecular pathways by which bone metabolism is affected have not always been clarified. Therefore, in this chapter, we aim to summarize the current literature on the influence of environmental factors on bone metabolism and disease and to review any recent updates in research about the impact of endocrine disruptors on bone health. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.},

The results showed that there was an association between OCPs exposure and decreased human semen parameters (OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.40–1.56), including decreased sperm volume (OR = 1.79, 95%CI = 1.15–2.79), decreased sperm count (OR = 1.31, 95%CI = 1.19–1.44), decreased sperm concentration (OR = 1.34, 95%CI = 1.10–1.63), impaired sperm motility (OR = 1.87, 95%CI = 1.16–3.01), and sperm morphology (OR = 1.42, 95%CI = 1.02–1.99), respectively. Additionally, in sub-group analysis according to the type of OCPs, there was no association between DDE exposure and decreased semen parameters (OR = 1.01, 95%CI = 0.99–1.03). In sub-group analysis according to the location, the results indicated a positive association between OCPs and sperm morphology (OR = 2.22, 95%CI = 1.40–3.54) in North America. Moreover, in Europe, the results indicated a positive association between OCPs and decreased semen parameters (OR = 1.45, 95%CI = 1.34–1.56), including decreased sperm volume (OR = 1.65, 95%CI = 1.06–2.58), decreased sperm count (OR = 1.71, 95%CI = 1.10–2.65), decreased sperm concentration (OR = 1.35, 95%CI = 1.04–1.74), and impaired sperm motility (OR=1.85, 95%CI = 1.11–3.08), respectively. Sensitivity analysis showed that the combined OR had good stability and high reliability. Funnel plots and Egger’s test showed a large publication bias in this study. Conclusions: The findings suggested that OCPs exposure may be a risk factor for a decline in semen parameters. Further actions are needed to protect male fertility in the future.

	abstract = {Objective: The reproductive toxicity of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been verified in both animal and in vitro experiments, however, the association between PFAS and female fertility remains contradictory in population studies. Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of PFAS on female fertility based on population evidence. Methods: Electronic searches of the Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were conducted (from inception to March 2022) to collect observational studies related to PFAS and female fertility. Two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted information and evaluated the risk of bias for the included studies, meta-analysis was performed using R software. Results: A total of 5468 records were searched and 13 articles fully met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was negatively associated with the female fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.88, 95% confidence interval (Cl) [0.78; 0.98]) and positively associated with the odds ratio for infertility (OR = 1.33, 95%Cl [1.03; 1.73]). Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) exposure was negatively associated with the fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.94, 95% CI [0.90; 0.98]). Pooled effect values for perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) exposure did not find sufficient evidence for an association with female fertility. Conclusion: Based on the evidence provided by the current study, increased levels of PFAS exposure are associated with reduced fertility in women, this was characterized by a reduction in fecundability odds ratio and an increase in odds ratio for infertility. This finding could partially explain the decline in female fertility and provide insight into risk assessment when manufacturing products containing PFAS. © 2022},

	abstract = {Chemical pollution is a major threat to marine ecosystems, and top predators such as most shark species are extremely vulnerable to being exposed and accumulating contaminants such as metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs). This work aimed to study the degree, composition, and the sources of contamination in the blue shark (Prionace glauca) inhabiting the Northeast Atlantic, as well as the potential risk faced by human consumers. A total of 60 sharks were sampled in situ aboard fishing vessels, and the concentrations of a set of metals and POPs were analysed in various tissues and complemented with stable isotope analyses. High levels of contaminants were found in most sharks sampled. The concentrations of most metals were higher in the muscle when compared with the liver. Regarding the dangers to consumers posed by the concentrations of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb), over 75% of the sharks presented muscle concentrations of at least one contaminant above the legal limits for human consumption, and a risk assessment determined that consumption of meat of these sharks exceeding 0.07 Kg per week could potentially expose human consumers to dangerous amounts of methylmercury (MeHg). Additionally, the assessment of single contaminants may lead to an underestimation of the risk for the human health. Finally, the overall accumulation of contaminants seems to be mostly influenced by the sharks’ geographical distribution, rather than sex, size, or trophic level of their prey. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Percutaneous cement discoplasty (PCD) is a minimally invasive procedure. We aim to explore the efficacy and indication(s) of PCD in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD). Methods: The search was conducted across Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PubMed. Data on study design, patient demographics, pre- and post-procedure Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and complications were extracted. Inclusion criteria focused on adult patients with degenerative spinal diseases treated with cement discoplasty. The overall effect size was evaluated using a forest plot, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic and chi-squared test. Results: The search strategy yielded six studies, which included 336 patients (73.8% female, 26.2% male) with a mean average age of 74.6 years. VAS scores were reported in all studies, showing a significant difference between pre- and post-PCD pain scores (Weighted Mean Difference [WMD]: -3.45; 95% CI: -3.83, -3.08; I2 = 15%; P <.001). ODI scores were reported in 83% of studies, with a significant difference between pre- and post-PCD scores (WMD: -22.22; 95% CI: -25.54, -18.89; I2 = 61%; p <.001). Complications reported included infections, thrombophlebitis, vertebral fractures, disc extrusion, and the need for further operations. Conclusions: The analysis showed clinically significant improvements in pain and functional disability based on VAS and ODI scores. However, due to methodological limitations and a high risk of bias, the validity and generalizability of the findings are uncertain. Despite these issues, the results provide preliminary insights into PCD's potential efficacy and can guide future research to address current limitations. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Background: In February 2021, over one hundred scientists and policy experts participated in a web-based Workshop to discuss the ways that divergent evaluations of evidence and scientific uncertainties are used to delay timely protection of human health and the environment from exposures to hazardous agents. The Workshop arose from a previous workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on ‘Late Lessons from Early Warnings’ (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those agents. Results: Workshop participants used recent case studies including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency – Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations, which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public’s health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence of financial conflicts of interest. Conclusion: The recommendations should enhance the production of “actionable evidence,” that is, reliable evaluations of the scientific evidence to support timely actions to protect health and environments from exposures to hazardous agents. The recommendations are applicable to policy and regulatory settings at the local, state, federal and international levels. © 2022, The Author(s).},

This current study investigated seasonal bioaccumulation of 9 heavy metals (Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in 14 commercially important seafood species, including 4 fish, 5 molluscs, and 5 crustacean species. Samples were collected from Pattani Bay, Pattani province, Thailand, during the dry (July 2020) and wet (February 2021) seasons. The edible samples were analyzed for heavy metal concentrations using a flame atomic absorption spectrophotometer. The bioaccumulation trend of heavy metals decreased in the sequence of molluscs > crustaceans > fish. The possible human health risks associated with heavy metal-contaminated seafood consumption were assessed. The parameters investigated for non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic were target hazard quotient (THQ), total hazard index (HI), and target cancer risk (TR). The average ranges of THQs (7.79 × 10−8–8.97 × 10−3), HIs (4.30 × 10−5–1.55 × 10−2), and TRs (2.70 × 10−9–1.34 × 10−5) were observed in the studied seafood species. The results revealed no non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic health risks from consuming these 14 kinds of seafood. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Nanoparticles (NPs) represent emerging pollutants that still pose analytical challenges for their detection in environmentally relevant samples due to their extremely low concentrations, high colloidal background, and the need to perform speciation analysis. They are also one of the interfering matrices during the analysis of metal ions and contaminants in water samples. Currently, conventional analytical techniques such as Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) and Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) are used for the detection of NPs, but such techniques require bulky instrumentation and are difficult to be automated for online analysis. In this study, we aim to develop a nanoparticle-imprinted hydrogel (NPIH, NANOGEL) to detect and capture NPs in water samples. The principle of the Nanogel originates from the well-known concept of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Cadmium sulfide/Selenide/Zinc sulfide core/shell quantum dots (QDs) were used as the template NP, creating specific pore cavities in the Nanogel that can selectively bind to certain analytes. Quantification of NPs detected in water samples was then made possible by transducing this selective detection process into an analytical signal using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The Nanogel was shown to demonstrate good repeatability, reproducibility, and stability in terms of its performance. The high selectivity of the Nanogel was determined to be attributed to the size of cavities and their surface characteristics. Ionic interference was present and, heavy metal cations showed an affinity for the NANOGEL synthesized; however, they were demonstrated to be minimized by the selection of porogenic solvents during the synthesis of NANOGEL. We believe that the Nanogel would provide a highly selective and sensitive approach for the detection of NPs in aqueous samples and the removal of NPs from contaminated water resources. It will serve useful in environmental applications. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Aims: Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during critical neurodevelopmental windows has been associated with the risk of autistic traits. This systematic review of epidemiological studies examined the association between maternal exposure to EDCs during pregnancy and the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the offspring. Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception to November 17, 2022, for studies investigating the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and outcomes related to ASD. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023389386). Results: We included 27 observational studies assessing prenatal exposure to phthalates (8 studies), polychlorinated biphenyls (8 studies), organophosphate pesticides (8 studies), phenols (7 studies), perfluoroalkyl substances (6 studies), organochlorine pesticides (5 studies), brominated flame retardants (3 studies), dioxins (1 study), and parabens (1 study). The number of examined children ranged from 77 to 1,556, the age at the assessment of autistic traits ranged from 3 to 14 years, and most studies assessed autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale. All but one study was considered to have a low risk of bias. Overall, there was no association between maternal exposure to specific ECDs during pregnancy and the occurrence of autistic traits in offspring. Conclusions: Findings from the epidemiological studies evaluated here do not support an association between prenatal exposure to ECDs and the likelihood of autistic traits in later in life. These findings should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of the absence of neurodevelopment effects of EDCs affecting ASD risk, given the limitations of current studies such as representative exposure assessment, small sample sizes, inadequacy to assess sexually dimorphic effects, or the effects of EDC mixtures. Future studies should carefully address these limitations. Copyright © 2023 Cunha, Amaral, Felix, Blumberg and Amato.},

	abstract = {The use of pesticides can affect the physical and chemical properties of paddy soil. Soil physical and chemical properties can indicate soil quality because they affect soil microbial activity. This study used an exploratory observational method to analyze the diversity and abundance of microbes in the soil microbiome of pesticide paddy fields (PPF) and non-pesticide paddy fields (PF). The PPF samples were taken from Purwosari Village, Mijen Subdistrict, Semarang City, while the PF samples were taken from Tambangan Village, Mijen Subdistrict, Semarang City. Soil samples were taken for chemical and metagenomic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene marker region V3-V4. The results showed that microbial PPF diversity was higher than PF's based on the Shannon and Simpson index. The PPF microbiome is dominated by 3 bacterial phyla, namely Proteobacteria (26.61%), Actinobacteriota (15.13%) and Acidobacteriota (11.44%). Meanwhile, the PF microbiome was dominated by Proteobacteria (28.73%), Acidobacteriota (12.80%), and Chloroflexi (11.41%). The Archaea phylum that dominates PPF are Halobacterota (62.78%), Euryarchaeota (20.82%), and Crenarchaeota (10.89%), while in PF it is dominated by Halobacterota (80.43%), Crenarchaeota (11.03%) and Euryarchaeota (5.04%). The phylum that plays an important role in the biodegradation of organochlorine pesticides is Actinobacteria, which dominates in PPF; low abundance of Nitrospirota in PPF as a bioindicator of organochlorine pesticide contamination. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

	abstract = {Dichloromethane (DCM; CH2Cl2) is a widespread pollutant with anthropogenic and natural sources. Anaerobic DCM-dechlorinating bacteria use the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, yet dechlorination reaction mechanisms remain unclear and the enzyme(s) responsible for carbon-chlorine bond cleavage have not been definitively identified. Of the three bacterial taxa known to carry out anaerobic dechlorination of DCM, ‘Candidatus Formimonas warabiya’ strain DCMF is the only organism that can also ferment non-chlorinated substrates, including quaternary amines (i.e., choline and glycine betaine) and methanol. Strain DCMF is present within enrichment culture DFE, which was derived from an organochlorine-contaminated aquifer. We utilized the metabolic versatility of strain DCMF to carry out comparative metaproteomics of cultures grown with DCM or glycine betaine. This revealed differential abundance of numerous proteins, including a methyltransferase gene cluster (the mec cassette) that was significantly more abundant during DCM degradation, as well as highly conserved amongst anaerobic DCM-degrading bacteria. This lends strong support to its involvement in DCM dechlorination. A putative glycine betaine methyltransferase was also discovered, adding to the limited knowledge about the fate of this widespread osmolyte in anoxic subsurface environments. Furthermore, the metagenome of enrichment culture DFE was assembled, resulting in five high quality and two low quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes. Metaproteogenomic analysis did not reveal any genes or proteins for utilization of DCM or glycine betaine in the cohabiting bacteria, supporting the previously held idea that they persist via necromass utilization.

They are used in a wide array of products and are found in living organisms around the world. Some PFAS have been associated with cancer, developmental toxicity, endocrine disruption, and other health effects. Only a fraction of PFAS are currently monitored and regulated and the presence and effects on aquatic organisms of many PFAS are largely unknown. The aim of this study is to investigate the health effects of environmentally relevant concentrations of PFAS on aquatic organisms at different consumer trophic levels through a systematic review and meta-analysis. The main result shows that PFAS in concentrations up to 13.5 μg/L have adverse effects on body size variables for secondary consumers. However, no significant effects on liver or gonad somatic indices and neither on fecundity were found. In addition, the results show that there are large research gaps for PFAS effects on different organisms in aquatic environments at environmentally relevant concentrations. Most studies have been performed on secondary consumers and there is a substantial lack of studies on other consumers in aquatic ecosystems. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder resulting from the interaction between genetic and environmental risk factors. It is well known that ADHD co-occurs frequently with other psychiatric disorders due, in part, to shared genetics factors. Although many studies have contributed to delineate the genetic landscape of psychiatric disorders, their specific molecular underpinnings are still not fully understood. The use of animal models can help us to understand the role of specific genes and environmental stimuli-induced epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of ADHD and its comorbidities. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the functional work performed in rodents, zebrafish and fruit fly and highlight the generated insights into the biology of ADHD, with a special focus on genetics and epigenetics. We also describe the behavioral tests that are available to study ADHD-relevant phenotypes and comorbid traits in these models. Furthermore, we have searched for new models to study ADHD and its comorbidities, which can be useful to test potential pharmacological treatments. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Aegle marmelos or bael is a medicinally important tree species used in various Indian traditional systems of medicines. In the present study, a sensitive and rapid high-performance thin-layer chromatography method was developed for the simultaneous determination of marmelosin, umbelliferone, and psoralen from the four different aerial parts of A. marmelos. The method uses HPTLC silica gel 60 RP-18 W plates as stationary phase, and acetonitrile: 0.1% orthophosphoric acid in water (1:1 v/v) as solvent system. The developed method is validated for specificity, precision, repeatability, and accuracy in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Further, the estimation of heavy metal suggested that the A. marmelos bark sample was highly contaminated with cadmium (3.8 ± 0.7 µg/g) which was far from the permissible range as described by World Health Organization (WHO). The observed chromium concentration was higher in the bark and the fruit than the normal range recorded in the plants. Arsenic and lead content was within the permissible range, while mercury was not detected in any of the tested samples. Studied samples were further tested for the presence of organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticides, as well as organophosphate and carbamates. Results suggested that gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) was more prominent and detected in the bark and the young twig samples. Carbamates were not detected in any of the samples. Aflatoxins were absent from all the samples analyzed through ultra-performance liquid chromatography - fluorescence (UPLC-FLR) analysis. The present study demonstrated that phytochemicals and physicochemical estimation are highly required for maintaining the quality of the raw drugs before the preparation of any formulations. © 2022},

	abstract = {PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are organofluorine substances that are used commercially in products like non-stick cookware, food packaging, personal care products, fire-fighting foam, etc. These chemicals have several different subtypes made of varying numbers of carbon and fluorine atoms. PFAS substances that have longer carbon chains, such as PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), can potentially pose a significant public health risk due to their ability to bioaccumulate and persist for long periods of time in the body and the environment. The National Academies Report suggests there is some evidence of PFOS exposure and gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation contributing to ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis are precursors to colorectal cancer. However, evidence about the association between PFOS and colorectal cancer is limited and has shown contradictory findings. This review provides an overview of population and preclinical studies on PFOS exposure and GI inflammation, metabolism, immune responses, and carcinogenesis. It also highlights some mitigation approaches to reduce the harmful effects of PFOS on GI tract and discusses the dietary strategies, such as an increase in soluble fiber intake, to reduce PFOS-induced alterations in cellular lipid metabolism. More importantly, this review demonstrates the urgent need to better understand the relationship between PFOS and GI pathology and carcinogenesis, which will enable development of better approaches for interventions in populations exposed to high levels of PFAS, and in particular to PFOS.

This study aimed to analyze the literature concerning the immunohistological and ultrastructural features of DFs. It also related these features to the histogenesis of these lesions. Methods: This study included a PubMed literature search for studies addressing the clinicopathological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical features of DFs. It also presented some current cases of CD34-negative DFs and a subset of these lesions with aberrant expression of this protein. Results: Analysis of the PubMed literature revealed that DFs with an aberrant expression of CD34 are rare tumors that commonly affect the extremities of adult females. Separating these tumors from dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP, CD34-positive tumors) requires using a large panel of immunostains. Ultrastructurally, DFs are composed of diverse cell types, including cells with histiocytic, myofibroblastic, and fibroblastic features. An analysis of the DFs described by this study revealed that cases with an aberrant expression of CD34 protein had slightly high mean age and male sex predominance when compared to CD34-negative cases. The former commonly affected the extremities. There was no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis on follow-up. Conclusions: DFs have the potential to express CD34 protein, defining a rare aberrant phenotype, which was not associated with any differences in the outcome as compared to CD34-negative DFs. © 2023 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance in pathogenic bacteria is one of the preeminent concerns for the future of global health. There is a dose-dependent relationship between antimicrobial use (AMU) and the prevalence of antimicrobial-resistant pathogens. As most AMU in Canada is related to animal agriculture, there is a need to reduce overall AMU, which could be accomplished through surveillance of AMU in animal agriculture, including the dairy industry. The objective of this study was to quantify AMU on dairy farms across Canada. This study had two parts: a description of data collected in 2019–2020, and a meta-analysis comparing this data to previous estimates of AMU in the Canadian dairy industry. The first included a garbage can audit (GCA) on 107 farms in four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Nova Scotia) in 2020; AMU data were converted to the dose-based metrics of defined course doses (DCD) and defined daily doses (DDD). Mixed-effect linear models were fit to determine the relationship between province and use of different classes of antimicrobials. On average, for every 100 animals on the farm, 117 DCD of antimicrobials were administered per year (IQR: 55, 158). These treatments amounted to 623 DDD / 100 animal-yr (IQR: 302, 677 DDD/100 animal-years). Penicillins were the most used class of antimicrobials, followed by first-and third-generation cephalosporins. Farms in Ontario used more third-generation cephalosporins than other provinces. The second part of this study compared AMU in 2020 to previously reported Canadian studies through a meta-analysis. A GCA was conducted in 2007–2008 in Alberta, Ontario, Québec, and the Maritime provinces (Prince Edward Island, New Brunswick and Nova Scotia); another GCA was conducted in Québec in 2018. Overall, AMU was lower in 2018–2020 than in 2007–2008, with the exception of third-generation cephalosporin use, which increased.

	abstract = {The aquatic ecosystem is the most complicated sphere among the hydrosphere’s components. The complexity results from transboundary interactions and reservoir nature that accumulates all forms of terrestrial washouts, marine and atmospheric pollutants such as dissolved and suspended organic, inorganic, and emerging pollutants. The aquatic ecosystem remains a gigantic habitat, transportation route, economic source, and strong buffer for all-natural and anthropogenic environmental turnovers, yet UNEP studies indicate that about 68% of “the environment-related sustainable development goal indicators” have data shortages to evaluate their progress. Therefore, sustainable access to informed data, accurate predictions, and aquatic pollution decisions presents an environmental challenge requiring global intervention. Thus, the availability of continuous, dynamic, and verifiable information supplements diverse, massive, and complex data flow for monitoring the state of the aquatic ecosystem. Storage of these big data requires volumes greater than terabytes, through computation methods that enable high speed and accuracy in accessing varieties of analytical information in real time. Big data presents a new era that gathers all resources, time-based information, and meta- and deeper analysis. Therefore, it is essential to utilize big data’s potential in identifying data gaps, likely vulnerabilities, and accurate predictions to maintain strategies for monitoring and mitigation of aquatic pollution for environmental sustainability. © 2023 selection and editorial matter, Alaa El Din Mahmoud, Manal Fawzy, and Nadeem Ahmad Khan.},

The objective of the article is to report the organochlorine pesticides pollution level of the bottom sediments and to define the possible sources of organochlorine pesticides in the marine environment Techniques: sample collection of bottom sediments, Gas Chromatography Mass Spectrometry analysis of samples, Gas-liquid Chromatography method with electronic capture detector, statistical processing, assessment of the organochlorine pesticides contamination of sediments Results. The new data were obtained on the organochlorine pesticides concentrations in Nakhodka bay in 2020–2021. The previous data on the studied area are described. The concentration of HCH pesticides (α-, β- and γ-HCH), DDT and its metabolites was analyzed. It was found that the concentration of α-, β- HCCH and DDT in bottom sediments increased in 2021.To determine the quality of bottom sediments, the average annual values of organochlorine pesticides concentrations in the bottom sediments gathered during the field works were compared with the quality guidelines. There are no approved quality guidelines for maximum permissible concentrations of pollutants in bottom sediments in the Russian Federation. For this reason, the quality guidelines applied in foreign countries («Dutch sheets» (Neue Niederlandische Liste, NNL) and Canadian quality standards for marine and estuarine bottom sediments (Canadian Sediment Quality Guidelines, CSQGs)) were used. Possible sources of organochlorine pesticides in the marine environment were analyzed. The results of this work showed that despite the ban on the use of these substances, these pesticides are included in the multiple compounds used in different industries and continue to enter and accumulate in the marine environment. © 2023 Tomsk Polytechnic University, Publishing House.

This review compiles recent information on the sources, occurrence, and health effects of PFAS in aquatic environments. Secondly, as a primary requirement for assessing the PFAS concentration in water, this review systematically summarised the analytical methodologies (sample preparation and analytical detection techniques) for PFAS. Furthermore, health risks associated with PFAS in water are outlined. Finally, researchers worldwide have investigated the strategies for the remediation and elimination of PFAS from water. Previous studies have shown that PFASs are present in various water bodies with the highest concentration detected in Germany (94–4,385 ng·L−1 in river and drinking waters). The findings of this review further revealed that solid-phase extraction techniques were the most preferred for sample preparation compared to liquid–liquid extraction techniques. Solid-phase extraction technique improved the limit of detection and the limit of quantification of many analytical techniques to 0.010–1.15 and 0.030–4.00 ng·L−1, respectively. For PFAS remediation, the adsorption method and chemical oxidation using heat-activated persulfate and photochemical oxidation were the most used techniques. The most studied water matrices were drinking, river, groundwater, wastewater, and modelled ultra-pure water. The most used detection technique was found to be liquid chromatograph-tandem mass spectrometer (LC-MS/MS). © 2023 De Gruyter. All rights reserved.},

Substantial concern exists regarding the human health effects of PFAS, particularly metabolic syndrome (MetS), a precursor to cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of mortality worldwide. This narrative review provides an overview of the PFAS literature on 4 specific components of MetS: insulin resistance/glucose dysregulation, central adiposity, dyslipidemia, and blood pressure. We focus on prospective cohort studies as these provide the best body of evidence compared to other study designs. Available evidence suggests potential associations between some PFAS and type-2 diabetes in adults, dyslipidemia in children and adults, and blood pressure in adults. Additionally, some studies found that sex and physical activity may modify these relationships. Future studies should consider modification by sex and lifestyle factors (e.g., diet and physical activity), as well quantifying the impact of PFAS mixtures on MetS features and related clinical disease. Finally, clinicians can follow recently developed clinical guidance to screen for PFAS exposure in patients, measure PFAS levels, conduct additional clinical care based on PFAS levels, and advise on PFAS exposure reduction. © Copyright 2023 The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The toxicity and environmental persistence of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) are of great concern for food intake in humans. However, PFASs conversion or conjugation to other substances in rice grown on PFASs polluted soil has not been explored clearly. These unknown transformed or conjugated products of PFOA and PFOS could be harmful to human health. The restriction factor in evaluating the possible transformation of PFOA and PFOS is mainly attributed to the lack of an efficient method for screening PFOA and PFOS and their related metabolites. To circumvent this challenge, we established a non-targeted screening method by combining a fluoro-cotton fiber-based solid phase extraction (FC-SPE) and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to monitor the formation of possible organic fluorine compounds from rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown on PFASs. We synthesized fluoro-cotton fibers to serve as the FC-SPE packing material and characterized by field-emission scanning electron-microscope, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The optimal extraction conditions for the prepared FC-SPE were investigated. The performance of FC-SPE in LC-MS analysis was validated by linearity, precision, recovery, and matrix effect. Then the FC-SPE combined with LC-HRMS was used to specifically capture organic fluorine compounds from complex matrices via F–F interaction, including rice seedlings grown in PFOA and PFOS polluted soil and soil samples. By the established FC-SPE LC-HRMS method, in total 429 features were found as the possible organic fluorine compounds from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil among the 1781 features from the rice seedlings. Finally, we employed a13C metabolic tracing analysis of organic fluorine compounds in combination with the FC-SPE LC-HRMS method to further identify the features that detected from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil. The final result indicated that there were not any new organic fluorine metabolites screened out from rice grown in PFOA or PFOS polluted soil. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background and Objective: Marine environments can be contaminated by various anthropogenic persistent organic pollutants, such as petroleum-related (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs), industrial (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyl, PCBs), and agriculture-related (e.g., organochlorine pesticides, OCPs) chemicals. Moreover, microplastic (MPs, particles < 5 mm) pollution of seawater is increasing in recent years and they can behave as a vehicle of chemicals acquired from the surrounding environment. Such MPs role is relevant from a public health perspective, increasing the exposure of beachgoers to harmful chemicals. In this paper, 40 field studies of MPs-sorbed organic pollutants were reviewed with the aim to understand the level of chemical contamination of MPs in the marine compartments. Methods: The literature search was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The keywords included microplastic in combination with the organic contaminants that could be adsorbed by MPs. Results: The methodology used for MPs-sorbed chemicals detection showed great differences among the studies, from sampling to analytical techniques. The most frequently searched chemicals were PCBs (55% of the reviewed papers) followed by PAHs (47.5%), and OCPs (42.5%). When such chemicals were searched, they were detected in almost one of the sampling sites included in each study. Overall, PCBs level showed a median concentration of 290 ng/g. The median PAH concentration was 3,595 ng/g, with an extremely high amount of 120,000 ng/g found in MPs from Chinese seawater. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was the most frequently detected OCP, with a median of 126.9 ng/g. Conclusion: This paper revealed that MPs can accumulate high level of chemicals in the marine environment, thus increasing the human exposure during swimming or rest on the beach. Despite the public health relevance of such human exposure, this topic is still little explored as demonstrated by the lack of standardized method for MPs collection and chemical analysis. © (2023), (European Publishing).

Only studies with humans with early exposure to agricultural pesticides and diagnosis of autism were included. Exclusion criteria were studies on pesticides for domestic or veterinary use and late exposure. There were no language and time restriction. The quality analysis of the studies used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Data synthesis: Six case-control studies were included; three of them measured the route of exposure by maternal biomarkers and the others by the residence address. The studies had scores between moderate and high in the quality assessment tool. It was found high rates of association between early exposure to agricultural pesticides and autism and detection limit above the quantification for a sample of polychlorinated biphenyls, hexachlorobenzene, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene. Conclusions: There is evidence concerning the exposure to agricultural pesticides in early life and the development of the autism spectrum disorder; however, more studies are required to better understand their possible association. © 2023 Sao Paulo Pediatric Society.

	abstract = {Environmental pollution caused by persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has increased the challenge for the scientific communities. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), classified as POPs, are widely applied in various materials as brominated flame retardants (BFRs). Because of the nature of these chemical compounds including toxicity, stability, and capability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify, PBDEs have posed a great challenge and risk to human health and wildlife. Therefore, the side effects of exposure to PBDEs as ubiquitous pollutants in the environment on cancer progression were investigated using a systematic review (SR) survey. To achieve this goal, forty studies were considered after defining the search terms and inclusion criteria, and/or exclusion criteria; the eligible records were collected from the international bibliographic databases. Based on the findings of the reviewed records, environmental exposure to the BFRs including PBDEs has a positive association with different mechanisms that induce cancer progression. However, the findings of the reviewed studies were not totally consistent with the mode of action and side effects are yet to be fully elucidated. Several articles have reported that BFRs can be carcinogenic and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition via different mechanisms. The main mode of action involved in the environmental exposure to BFRs and the risk of cancer progression is endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress (OS). Generally, the imbalance of antioxidant mechanisms, reactive nitrogen species (RNSs) and reactive oxygen species (ROSs), during damage in cells, and stress caused OS, which increases tumorigenesis via multiple mechanisms, such as DNA damage, inflammation, and angiogenesis. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Infertility is a global health problem that represents an increasing trend due to new lifestyles following technological advances since individuals are facing more risk factors than before. The present systematic review study aimed to investigate the impact of environmental and occupational factors on reproductive parameters and increased risk of couple infertility. Main body: Scopus, PubMed, SID, and Web of Science databases were searched for the available observational (i.e., cohort, case-control, and cross-sectional) systematic review, meta-analysis, and clinical trial studies between 2007 and 2019. To this end, keywords such as ‘Environmental exposure’, ‘Occupational exposure’, ‘Environmental pollutants’, ‘Environmental pollution’, ‘Couple infertility’, ‘Sterility’, and ‘Sub-fertility’ were used. The retrieved investigations examined the impact of environmental and occupational risk factors on reproductive indices and increased infertility risk. Totally, 66 out of 9519 papers were evaluated after considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The reported risk factors in the reviewed studies were heavy metals, cigarette smoking, and exposure to chemicals through consumer goods, urban life, and proximity to main roads. In addition, occupational factors included heavy physical activity, prolonged sitting, exposure to a hot environment, contact with formaldehyde, pesticides, insecticides, mechanical vibration, and contact with ionizing radiation, all of which affected the reproductive parameters. However, some researchers found no significant associations in this regard. Short conclusion: In general, individuals with known impairments in reproductive parameters were more exposed to risk factors. Nonetheless, more studies are needed to determine the risk of infertility in the population. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Pesticides can impact the agriculture and environmental sector both positively and negatively. An over-reliance on their application to crops to control pests can disturb ecosystems. Therefore, the scientific community and policymakers must be aware of the commitment and active stance they need to take up to effectively elaborate on solutions toward mitigating environmental contamination over the coming few years. We, therefore, reviewed the academic literature on bioremediation from 2018 to 2021 (the latest year of complete publication) to provide a meta-analysis of microbial systems capable of dissipating pesticides from agricultural soils. Natural attenuation can control lindane; however, it is time-consuming and unconvincing to scale. By introducing a suite of microorganisms into the system for substrate-specific biodegradation, we can boost the bioprocess and ultimately level up its cost-effectiveness. Options of microorganisms for bioaugmentation include the fungus Trametes versicolor and the bacteria Pigmentiphaga spp. and Paenanthrobacter spp. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation are enablers of environmental reclamation in agroecosystems. However, those biocatalytic strategies can be costly while manifesting as degraders to ecological sustainability. For instance, allochthonous and recombinant microorganisms can reduce genetic diversity by promoting antagonistic relationships. In addition, some stimulant minerals can be more toxic and harmful to beneficial non-target organisms than the target pesticide. Prudence and safety are significant aspects of ensuring environmentally safer applications for pesticide-degrading approaches. Therefore, our analytical insights can provide knowledge to progress the field’s prominence in developing high-throughput microbiological removal of hazardous active compounds from agricultural soils. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Purpose/Aim of the Study: The formyl peptide receptor (FPR) participates in the immune response, with roles in infection and inflammation. In this review article, we summarize the current literature on these roles before discussing the function of FPRs in the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis (OA), degenerative disc disease (DDD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, we discuss the potential diagnostic and therapeutic roles of FPRs in these domains. Methods: PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE searches were performed from 1965 through March 2022. Keywords included “FPR, tissue expression, inflammation, infection, musculoskeletal disorder, bone, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, mitochondria.” Results: Sixty-nine studies were included in this review article. FPRs appear to be ubiquitous in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of common musculoskeletal disorders. They can potentially be utilized for the earlier diagnosis of OA and DDD. They may be employed with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to reverse OA and DDD pathologies. With anti-inflammatory, anti-osteolytic, and pro-angiogenic functions, they may broaden treatment options in RA. Conclusions: FPRs appear to be heavily involved in the pathogenesis of common musculoskeletal conditions, including arthritis, degenerative disc disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, they demonstrate much promise in the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. Their roles should continue to be explored. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Informal electronic waste (e-waste) dismantling activities contribute to releasing hazardous compounds in the environment and potential exposure to humans and their health. These hazardous compounds include persistent organic pollutants (POPs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and heavy metals. This review searched papers addressing hazardous compounds emitted from e-waste recycling activities and their health effects in Vietnam. Based on the keywords searched in three electronic databases (PubMed, Psych Info, and Google scholar), we found 21 relevant studies in Vietnam. The review identifies extensive e-waste dismantling activities in Vietnam in the northern region. To measure the environmental exposure to hazardous compounds, samples such as e-waste recycling workshop dust, soil, air, and sediments were assessed, while human exposure levels were measured using participants' hair, serum, or breast milk samples. Studies that compared levels of exposure in e-waste recycling sites and reference sites indicated higher levels of PBDEs, PCBs, and heavy metals were observed in both environmental and human samples from participants in e-waste recycling sites. Among environmental samples, hazardous chemicals were the most detected in dust from e-waste recycling sites. Considering both environmental and human samples, the highest exposure difference observed with PBDE ranged from 2-48-fold higher in e-waste processing sites than in the reference sites. PCBs showed nearly 3-fold higher levels in e-waste processing sites than in reference sites. In the e-waste processing sites, age-specific higher PCB levels were observed in older recycler's serum samples. Among the heavy metals, Pb was highly detected in drinking water, indoor soil and human blood samples. While high detection of Ni in cooked rice, Mn in soil and diet, Zn in dust and As in urine were apparent. Exposure assessment from human biomonitoring showed participants, including children and mothers from the e-waste processing areas, had higher carcinogenic and non-carcinogenic risks than the reference sites. This review paper highlights the importance of further comprehensive studies on risk assessments of environmentally hazardous substances and their association with health outcomes at e-waste processing sites.  © 2023 the author(s), published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston 2023.},

	abstract = {Moringa oleifera utilization in water treatment to eliminate emerging pollutants such as heavy metal ions, pesticides, pharmaceuticals, and pigments has been extensively evaluated. The efficacy of Moringa oleifera biosorbent has been investigated in diverse research work using various techniques, including its adsorption capacity kinetic, thermodynamic evaluation, adsorbent modifications, and mechanism behind the adsorption process. The Langmuir isotherm provided the most remarkable experimental data fit for batch adsorption investigations, whereas the best fit was obtained with the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Furthermore, only a few papers that combined batch adsorption with fixed-bed column investigations were examined. In the latter articles, the scientists modified the adsorbent to increase the material’s adsorption capacity as determined by analytical methods, including IR spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). However, the raw material can show appreciable adsorption capacity values, proving moringa’s potency as a biosorbent. Hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, and van der Waals forces were the main processes in the found and reported adsorbent-adsorbate interactions. These mechanisms could change depending on the physiochemical nature of adsorption. Although frequently employed for heavy metal ions and dye adsorption, Moringa oleifera can still be explored in pesticide and medication adsorption investigations due to the few publications in this comprehensive review. This study, therefore, examined different Adsorbents from the Moringa oleifera plant, as well as parameters and models for enhancing the adsorption process. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Biological degradation is environmentally friendly and the most appealing remediation method for a wide range of persistent pollutants. Meanwhile, due to the large microbial strain collection and multiple metabolic pathways, PAH degradation via an artificial mixed microbial system (MMS) has emerged and is regarded as a promising bioremediation approach. The artificial MMS construction by simplifying the community structure, clarifying the labor division, and streamlining the metabolic flux has shown tremendous efficiency. This review describes the construction principles, influencing factors, and enhancement strategies of artificial MMS for PAH degradation. In addition, we identify the challenges and future opportunities for the development of MMS toward new or upgraded high-performance applications.

	abstract = {Heavy metals are one of the most harmful elemental pollutants due to their high toxicity that can affect humans. Some of the metals can have an adverse impact on the aquatic environment, even present in a lower concentration. The present study investigates the concentration of the selected heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As, and T-Hg) in Faunus ater (Mollusca, Gastropoda) that was collected from the rivers surrounding Universiti Malaysia Terengganu area. At each station, 25 individuals were collected. A total of 100 individuals of F. ater were collected at four different stations. The Teflon bomb digestion method was used to digest the samples after mixing them with 1.5 mL of suprapur nitric acid. Heavy metal concentration is analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), model Perkin Elmer Elan 9000, and the pollution status is evaluated by Pollution Load Index (PLI). The concentration of heavy metal is varied within the stations. The average concentration of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As, and T-Hg in F. ater was 29.7±1.29 μg/g dry wt., 42.1±7.77 μg/g dry wt., 0.26±0.04 μg/g dry wt., 0.58±0.08 μg/g dry wt., 2.17±021 μg/g dry wt. and 0.19±0.04 μg/g dry wt., respectively. One-way ANOVA test shows that for metal Cu, Zn, Pb, and As, there is no statistically significant difference in all stations (p > 0.05). A positive correlation of Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb is observed with the size of F. ater, suggesting that the bioaccumulation process occurs in the F. ater. For metal and metal correlation, only Zn-Cd shows a moderate correlation compared to other metals and indicates that metals from the study area come from different sources of pollutants. The PLI value in the study area was recorded below 50, which indicated no detailed survey is needed. This study highlighted the potential use of mollusks such as F. ater as an excellent and reliable organism for heavy metal contamination indicators due to its capability to accumulate metals in body tissues.  © Published under licence by IOP Publishing Ltd.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Antimicrobial stewardship aims to slow the emergence of antimicrobial resistance. We conducted a systematic review on the use of digital antimicrobial stewardship programmes (ASP) on antimicrobial usage, cost, length of stay (LoS) and mortality. Methods: We identified, quality appraised using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale, and descriptively and narratively synthesised data on primary research articles that implemented an ASP(s) for adult inpatients for at least six months, and reported antimicrobial usage as defined daily dose (DDD) per 1000 patient days and at least one of: LoS, mortality or cost. Our review was registered with PROSPERO: CRD42020154124 and adhered to the PRISMA guideline. Results: Our searches retrieved 3,997 titles, from which 13 studies were included. The risk of bias assessment resulted in 10 studies receiving a rating of 7 stars or over. A range of ASPs were implemented using computerised decision support (CDS) systems, including those that combined audit and feedback, guidelines and approval, computerised approval processing, computerised recommendations and surveillance. All studies found a decrease in antimicrobial usage (DDD range, −8.42% to −61.29%). All six studies that considered costs also showed a decrease (range, −8.12% to −69.19%). Six studies reported a decrease in mortality and one showed no change. Discussion: The digital ASP programmes investigated appeared to have a positive impact on antimicrobial usage and clinical outcomes. Our review found that ASPs that utilised an audit and feedback approach showed a promising and consistent reduction in DDD. © 2023 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Background: Inflammation and metabolism exhibit a complex interplay, where inflammation influences metabolic pathways, and in turn, metabolism shapes the quality of immune responses. Here, glucose turnover is of special interest, as proinflammatory immune cells mainly utilize glycolysis to meet their energy needs. Noninvasive approaches to monitor both processes would help elucidate this interwoven relationship to identify new therapeutic targets and diagnostic opportunities. Methods: For induction of defined inflammatory hotspots, LPS-doped Matrigel plugs were implanted into the neck of C57BL/6J mice. Subsequently, 1H/19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to track the recruitment of 19F-loaded immune cells to the inflammatory focus and deuterium (2H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to monitor the metabolic fate of [6,6-2H2]glucose within the affected tissue. Histology and flow cytometry were used to validate the in vivo data. Results: After plug implantation and intravenous administration of the 19F-containing contrast agent, 1H/19F MRI confirmed the infiltration of 19F-labeled immune cells into LPS-doped plugs while no 19F signal was observed in PBS-containing control plugs. Identification of the inflammatory focus was followed by i.p. bolus injection of deuterated glucose and continuous 2H MRS. Inflammation-induced alterations in metabolic fluxes could be tracked with an excellent temporal resolution of 2 min up to approximately 60 min after injection and demonstrated a more anaerobic glucose utilization in the initial phase of immune cell recruitment. Conclusion: 1H/2H/19F MRI/MRS was successfully employed for noninvasive monitoring of metabolic alterations in an inflammatory environment, paving the way for simultaneous in vivo registration of immunometabolic data in basic research and patients.

	abstract = {Bisphenol A (2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl) propane, BPA) belongs to the so-called emerging pollutants having endocrine-disrupting properties. In addition, it is suspected of having carcinogenic properties. BPA is used in the manufacture of several everyday products and, as a result, its discharge into the environment is expected. Thus, it is found in surface water, groundwater, and seawater at concentrations ranging from 5 to 200ng/L, which are potentially harmful to humans and wildlife. Therefore, the removal of BPA from industrial wastewater to avoid BPA environmental pollution is a matter of serious worldwide concern. The conventional wastewater treatment processes are costly and inefficient for the removal of BPA. This has driven the search for alternative methods such as those based on oxidative enzymes. In this context, laccases are attracting increasing interest in the last decades due to their broad substrate specificity and the fact that they only need molecular oxygen to exert their catalytic action producing water as the only by-product. This approach is believed to be a promising technology since it is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and does not produce sludge. Detailed characterization of the intermediates and metabolites produced during enzymatic degradation of BPA as well as toxicity studies are of great importance to assess the effectiveness of the biodegradation process. This review reports the metabolites found by different researchers in the degradation of BPA by laccase enzymes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

Described as persistent, bioaccumulative, and dangerous for aquatic biota, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are considered emerging pollutants intensified by the COVID-19 pandemic, occurring in low concentrations that are not totally removed in wastewater treatment plants and are not covered by legislation. This article presents a theoretical approach based on literature review following a semi-systematic methodology covering detection strategies of the chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine drugs in effluent and receiving water bodies; estimates of environmental concentrations during the pandemic; methods that use degradation and removal of compounds from water; and toxic effects on aquatic biota. Concentrations previously detected and estimated in the aquatic environment can lead to significant changes in animal physiology analyzed from biomarker changes, behavior and mortality in studies with native and non-native species. Studies are necessary to reproduce and understand possible environmental scenarios adopting the indiscriminate use of drugs to serve as standards for environmentally safe concentrations when there is no specific legislation. © 2023, Institute for Environmental Research in Hydrographic Basins (IPABHi).

	abstract = {Plastic production is continuously increasing worldwide for daily use. Micro-plastics and nano-plastics remain major emerging pollutants and threaten the environment, ecosystem, human health, and well-being. Micro-nanoplastics (MNPs) are also exposed to humans through cosmetics, inhalation, ingestion, drinking water, dietary sources, and drug formulations. Oral uptake is the major among the different exposure routes of MNPs to humans. After entry, it gets absorbed due to its nano size (˂100 nm) and easily distributed to all parts of the body through blood, affecting multiple organs, especially vital organs of the human body leading to severe diseases. It causes cancer, heart, liver, and kidney diseases, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and affects the brain. Its adsorption with protein leads to multi-layered corona formation in human blood plasma. MNPs interact with immune cells and induce pro-inflammatory mediators, inflammatory reactions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and associated cytotoxicity. MNPs suppress T lymphocyte activity which results in a lack of immune regulation leading to autoimmune diseases. Hence, it is necessary to understand the impact of MNPs exposure on humans. Strict control measures for the production and use of plastics and developing appropriate strategies for safe disposal would prevent MNPs-mediated toxicity in humans. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Cutaneous and mucocutaneous histiocytosis (group C) comprise a wide variety of entities affecting skin and/or mucosae. Although they are considered as reactive proliferations, their exact pathophysiology remains unknown and, therefore, they lack a specific treatment. Aims: The aim of this study is to review the evidence on cases of histiocytosis treated with UVB and/or UVA and to report a new case of relapsing group C histiocytosis that has been successfully treated with PUVA therapy. Materials & Methods: We have conducted a review of the literature published over the last 40 years on the treatment of histiocytosis with phototherapy in the online PubMed database. We also describe a new case of successful treatment of histiocytosis with PUVA therapy. Results: Our patient was a 27-year-old man with persistent outbreaks of cutaneous histiocytosis over the previous 8 years. He responded successfully to PUVA therapy, and no relapse has been detected after one year of follow-up. Discussion: Self-involution is usual in group C histiocytosis, so conservative management is usually the first approach. Relapsing cases pose a therapeutic challenge. Reported treatment options for these patients include isotretinoin, cryotherapy, immunosuppressants, low-dose chemotherapy, CO2 laser, radiotherapy, and surgery. Phototherapy and photochemotherapy have been used in a small number of patients with considerable success. The main limitation to provide firm recommendations on histiocytosis therapy is the absence of solid evidence, as the articles published are mainly case reports with a short follow-up. In our patient, despite the short follow-up we have considered photochemotherapy to be effective since no spontaneous remission had been achieved in the previous 8 years. Conclusion: PUVA therapy could be a safe and effective option to treat persistent cutaneous manifestations in patients with histiocytosis, although more evidence is required to support this statement. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

	abstract = {Background: Existing evidence indicates that exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) may increase the risk of hypertension, but the findings are inconsistent. Therefore, we aimed to explore the relationship between PFASs and hypertension through this systematic review and meta-analysis. Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science databases for articles published in English that examined the relationship between PFASs and hypertension before 13 August 2022. The random effects model was used to aggregate the evaluation using Stata 15.0 for Windows. We also conducted subgroup analyses by region and hypertension definition. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was carried out to determine the robustness of the findings. Results: The meta-analysis comprised 15 studies in total with 69,949 individuals. The risk of hypertension was substantially and positively correlated with exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) (OR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.51), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) (OR = 1.16, 95% CI: 1.07, 1.26), and perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS) (OR = 1.04, 95% CI: 1.00, 1.09). However, perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) exposure and hypertension were not significantly associated (OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 0.99, 1.17). Conclusion: We evaluated the link between PFASs exposure and hypertension and discovered that higher levels of PFOS, PFOA, and PFHxS were correlated with an increased risk of hypertension. However, further high-quality population-based and pathophysiological investigations are required to shed light on the possible mechanism and demonstrate causation because of the considerable variability.

	abstract = {Emerging pollutants are natural and synthetic chemicals that have recently been identified as dangerous to the environment and consequently to the health of human beings. A growing number of evidence shows that skin exposure is an important intake pathway for human to absorb emerging pollutants. The skin permeability of pollutants is mainly reflected by the skin permeability coefficient and permeation flux. In vivo or in vitro experiments with human and animal models are the main means to determine the transdermal characteristics of emerging pollutants. However, these methods have many disadvantages such as high cost, time-consuming, large differences, and ethics. It is difficult to accurately estimate the skin exposure risk of emerging pollutants. Therefore, it is necessary to build up a skin permeability prediction mathematical model to assess the exposure and health risks of emerging pollutants. This article systematically reviews the research progress on the application of the skin permeability prediction model in the health risk assessment of emerging pollutants. At first, the basic structure of the skin and the main transdermal absorption pathways of emerging pollutants are introduced. Secondly, the basic principles and applications of existing skin permeability prediction models are summarized. The QSAR model and PBTK model were described according to the ratio of penetration to exposure dose. The QSAR model is described in detail to establish a regular model to predict the permeability of chemical pollutants in the skin by linking the structure and physicochemical characteristics of chemical substances with skin permeability. The accuracy of the results depends on the reliability of the modeling data. The PBTK model can be divided into the single-compartment model and the two-compartment model according to the characteristics of skin structure. And we summarized the application of the PBTK model on exposure risk assessment for industry workers or consumers. Moreover, we clarified the application of permeability prediction models in exposure risk and human health risk assessment and prospected the future research direction on dermal exposure risk assessment of emerging pollutants. The skin permeability prediction model optimizes the exposure parameters of daily skin exposure in risk assessment by predicting the skin permeability coefficient or permeability of emerging pollutants, to accurately assess the human exposure and health risk of emerging pollutants. At the end of this research progress, the future research objectives of skin permeability prediction models are pointed out: Improving the accuracy of data and considering the effect of skin esterase on skin permeability in prediction models. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Approximately, a fifth of the global burden of type 2 diabetes can be attributed to air particulate pollution. However, scientific knowledge remains limited about the effects of airborne nanoplastics (NPs) exposure on metabolic diseases. In this experiment, a whole-body exposure system was used to simulate the real atmospheric environment, and three exposure concentrations combined with the actual environmental concentration were selected to explore the effects of airborne NPs on metabolic diseases. Based on histological analyses, metabolic studies, gene expression, metabolites, and molecular signaling analyses, mice exposed to airborne NPs were observed to show a phenotype of systemic inflammation and complete insulin resistance featuring excessive drinking and eating, weight loss, elevated blood glucose, and decreased triglyceride levels. After airborne NPs exposure, mice were intolerant to glucose and tolerant to insulin. In addition, airborne NPs exposure could result in long-term irreversible hyperglycemia. Together, the research findings provide a strong basis for understanding the hazards of airborne nanopollution on metabolic disorders. © 2024 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a diverse class of chemicals used in industrial processes, consumer products, and fire-fighting foams which have become environmental pollutants of concern due to their persistence, ubiquity, and associations with adverse human health outcomes, including in pregnant persons and their offspring. Multiple PFAS are associated with adverse liver outcomes in adult humans and toxicological models, but effects on the developing liver are not fully described. Here we performed transcriptomic analyses in the mouse to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatic toxicity in the dam and its fetus after exposure to two different PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its replacement, hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA, known as GenX). Pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed via oral gavage from embryonic day (E) 1.5–17.5 to PFOA (0, 1, or 5 mg/kg-d) or GenX (0, 2, or 10 mg/kg-d). Maternal and fetal liver RNA was isolated (N = 5 per dose/group) and the transcriptome analyzed by Affymetrix Array. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and differentially enriched pathways (DEP) were obtained. DEG patterns were similar in maternal liver for 5 mg/kg PFOA, 2 mg/kg GenX, and 10 mg/kg GenX (R2: 0.46–0.66). DEG patterns were similar across all 4 dose groups in fetal liver (R2: 0.59–0.81). There were more DEGs in fetal liver compared to maternal liver at the low doses for both PFOA (fetal = 69, maternal = 8) and GenX (fetal = 154, maternal = 93). Upregulated DEPs identified across all groups included Fatty Acid Metabolism, Peroxisome, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Adipogenesis, and Bile Acid Metabolism. Transcriptome-phenotype correlation analyses demonstrated > 1000 maternal liver DEGs were significantly correlated with maternal relative liver weight (R2 >0.92). These findings show shared biological pathways of liver toxicity for PFOA and GenX in maternal and fetal livers in CD-1 mice. The limited overlap in specific DEGs between the dam and fetus suggests the developing liver responds differently than the adult liver to these chemical stressors. This work helps define mechanisms of hepatic toxicity of two structurally unique PFAS and may help predict latent consequences of developmental exposure. © 2022},

This study aimed to determine the role of pesticides in the development of autism spectrum disorders in children through meta-analysis .All studies (11 articles) that had the potential to be used in our study were exported in EndNote X8 software and reviewed by authors. We extracted the required data, and we used Stata software (version 12) to analyze the pooled effect. Random and fixed-effect models were used to determine the combined estimation using the “metan” command.The results showed exposure to organochlorine pesticides could increase the risk of autism by 32% (OR=1.32; 95% CI: 1.14-1.53). The first trimester of pregnancy had the highest risk for autism (OR=1.23; 95% CI: 1.15-1.31). The cumulative meta-analysis showed a decreasing trend for crude and adjusted odds ratio over time. This study showed that exposure to pesticides can increase the risk of autism, and the time of exposure to pesticides is associated with the risk of autism. These results came as the cumulative meta-analysis results for crude and adjusted odds ratios showed a decreasing trend over time. © 2023, Islamic Azad University. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Aerobic bacterial degradation of chlorophenols in bacteria occurs via two main pathways and, first of all, depends on the degree of halogenation of the substrate. Mono- and dichlorophenols are hydroxylated to (chloro)catechols and are further metabolized by the ortho-clearance pathway. Polychlorinated phenols are utilized by bacteria via hydroquinone/hydroxyhydroquinone followed by the meta-cleavage of its aromatic ring with the formation of maleylacetate and then β-ketoadipate. Most research has been focused on organisms and catabolic pathways that involve the degradation of (chloro)aromatic substrates via catechols, while the alternative hydroquinone pathway remains poorly understood and described. This review provides information on the metabolic pathways of p-chloro-substituted phenols, where special attention is paid to flavin-dependent monooxygenases that catalyze the primary reactions of substrate oxidation. © 2022, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.},

	abstract = {Hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acids (HFPO-DA) and hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acids (HFPO-TA) are alternatives to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). However, little information on the comparison of their toxicities is available. Here, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PFOA, HFPO-DA, and HFPO-TA with exposure concentrations of 5 and 500 μg/L. Behavioral abnormal, enzyme activities and gene expression profiles in zebrafish embryos were determined. Results showed that exposure to PFOA and its alternatives increased heart rates and inhibited locomotor activity of zebrafish embryos. Further, their exposures changed the enzyme activities (acetylcholinesterase and oxidative stress-related enzymes), ATP content, and expressions of genes related to hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid (HPT) axis, apoptosis, and lipid metabolism. Comparison analyses found that PFOA, HFPO-TA, and HFPO-DA exposures induced different effects on the embryonic development of zebrafish, which indicates the different modes of action. The HFPO-DA exposure induced specific effects on the disorder of lipid metabolism, HPT axis, and neurodevelopment. The HFPO-TA exposure also induced different effects from the PFOA exposure, which focused on lipid metabolism. The current data shows that the HFPO-DA and HFPO-TA might not be safe alternatives to PFOA. This study provides a new understanding of the biological hazards of PFOA alternatives in aquatic organisms, which can guide their usage. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {The eastern Guizhou Pb–Zn metallogenic belt (EGMB) is an important source of Pb–Zn resources and other critical minerals (including dispersed metals, such as Ge, Cd and Ga) in China. In order to ensure the continuous resource supply of Pb–Zn and associated dispersed metals, it is urgent to explore the direction of further prospecting for them. Fractal theory can realize the fractal structure characterization of fault structures and the spatial distribution of mineral deposits, which is helpful for mineral exploration. However, the fault fractal research and prospecting application are still seldom covered in the EGMB. We used fractal theory to determine fine-scale fractal structure characteristics of fault structures and ore deposits in the EGMB, and Fry analysis to delineate favorable metallogenic areas. The results show that within a scale range of 3.670–58.716 km, the integrated faults capacity dimension (CPD) is 1.5095, the information dimension (IND) is 1.5391, and the correlation dimension (CRD) is 1.5436, indicating fault structures with high maturity, which are conducive to the migration and accumulation of ore-forming fluids. The multi-fractal spectrum width and height are 0.3203 and 1.5355, respectively, implying a significant metallogenic potential. The spatial distribution fractal dimensions (SDD) of Pb–Zn specifically and metal deposits in general are 1.0193 and 1.0709, respectively; the quantity distribution fractal dimensions (QDD) are 1.4225 and 1.4716, respectively, and the density distribution fractal dimensions (DDD) are 1.422 and 1.472, respectively, indicating strong clustering. Hence, the favorable metallogenic regions can be divided into four grades, among which grade I region is continuously distributed in space and has the greatest prospecting potential. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been ubiquitously detected in the aquatic environment which poses a risk for human exposure. The recalcitrant behavior of PFAS to most traditional water treatment processes calls for development of novel or modified treatment approaches for effective PFAS elimination. Currently, high-pressure membrane systems, including nanofiltration (NF) and reverse osmosis (RO) are among the most promising and readily applied technologies for PFAS removal. In this review, we summarized peer-reviewed scientific articles on the development and use of 20 different types of commercial and 6 synthesized/modified NF and RO membranes in terms of PFAS removal efficacy. Synthesizing of existing knowledge shows that under environmentally relevant pH and concentration, NF and RO can effectively remove PFAS from water. The impact of PFAS molecular weight (MW) and functionality, membrane characteristics, feed water constitution, natural organic matters and operational conditions were systematically reviewed and evaluated. Moving forward, we recommend additional research dedicated to understanding the behaviors of PFAS alternatives and other overlooked compounds (e.g., PFAS with chain length C2 and C3) during NF and RO processes. Further, it is critical to develop or optimize existing membrane products with strong selectivity for specific PFAS species, while being resistant to fouling. Overall, this review is expected to assist researchers and water quality managers investigating membrane processes for PFAS removal. © 2022},

	abstract = {Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) is an acceptable small laboratory fish model for the evaluation and assessment of endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) found in the environment. In this research, we used this fish as a potential tool for the identification of EDCs that have a significant impact on human health. We conducted an electronic search in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) using the search terms, Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, and endocrine disruptions, and sorted 205 articles consisting of 128 chemicals that showed potential effects on estrogen–androgen–thyroid–steroidogenesis (EATS) pathways of Japanese medaka. From these chemicals, 14 compounds, namely, 17β-estradiol (E2), ethinylestradiol (EE2), tamoxifen (TAM), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), 17β-trenbolone (TRB), flutamide (FLU), vinclozolin (VIN), triiodothyronine (T3), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), terephthalic acid (TPA), trifloxystrobin (TRF), ketoconazole (KTC), and prochloraz (PCZ), were selected as references and used for the identification of apical endpoints within the EATS modalities. Among these endpoints, during classification, priorities are given to sex reversal (masculinization of females and feminization of males), gonad histology (testis–ova or ovotestis), secondary sex characteristics (anal fin papillae of males), plasma and liver vitellogenin (VTG) contents in males, swim bladder inflation during larval development, hepatic vitellogenin (vtg) and choriogenin (chg) genes in the liver of males, and several genes, including estrogen–androgen–thyroid receptors in the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad/thyroid axis (HPG/T). After reviewing 205 articles, we identified 108 (52.68%), 46 (22.43%), 19 (9.26%), 22 (17.18%), and 26 (12.68%) papers that represented studies on estrogen endocrine disruptors (EEDs), androgen endocrine disruptors (AEDs), thyroid endocrine disruptors (TEDs), and/or steroidogenesis modulators (MOS), respectively. Most importantly, among 128 EDCs, 32 (25%), 22 (17.18%), 15 (11.8%), and 14 (10.93%) chemicals were classified as EEDs, AEDs, TEDs, and MOS, respectively. We also identified 43 (33.59%) chemicals as high-priority candidates for tier 2 tests, and 13 chemicals (10.15%) show enough potential to be considered EDCs without any further tier-based studies. Although our literature search was unable to identify the EATS targets of 45 chemicals (35%) studied in 60 (29.26%) of the 205 articles, our approach has sufficient potential to further move the laboratory-based research data on Japanese medaka for applications in regulatory risk assessments in humans.

	abstract = {Osteoporosis is a complex non-communicable disease characterized by low bone mineral density (BMD). Exposure to environmental factors such as air pollution and heavy metals has been linked to low BMD. This study aimed to review the emerging evidence investigating the associations between exposure to environmental chemicals and human bone mineral density or the risk of osteoporosis. A comprehensive electronic search was performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Embase up to March 3, 2022. Beta coefficients were extracted with 95% confidence intervals to calculate pooled mean differences for BMD in random effect models. For data synthesis, main exposure groups were identified using the Fourth National Report on Human Exposure to Environmental Chemicals, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Overall, 3181 records were identified. We reviewed 27 English articles with an analytical observational study design. In quantitative analysis, exposure to perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) was significantly associated with low spinal BMD among women (mean difference = − 0.01 g/cm2, 95% CI − 0.02 to − 0.004 g/cm2). Up to date, there is supportive evidence for the inverse associations of perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) and phthalates with BMD. The association of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) with BMD seems to vary by specific urinary PAHs and bone sites. For bisphenols and organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs), the evidence for negative associations with BMD is insufficient. For other groups, including triclosan, polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDDs), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), the research is controversial or scant and needs to be extended. Available high-quality evidence supports the association between exposure to some environmental chemicals and lower BMD as well as increased risk of osteoporosis. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V.},

	abstract = {Human biomonitoring could provide direct information on internal exposure of environmental pollutants, which is important in objective assessment of human health risks and formulation of relevant standards and specifications. Blood and urine are traditionally used as human biomonitoring tools for internal exposure of environmental pollutants, while human hair, as an alternative matrix, has been seen as an attractive biomonitoring substrate because of the convenient and noninvasively collection, with minimal cost, and easy storage and transport for laboratory analysis. Also, hair sampling reflects fairly long-term exposure and may pinpoint the actual time of an acute exposure, as compared to routine biomonitoring tools. Owing to the advantages, an increasing number of studies have devoted to developing hair analysis in the past decades. However, concerns have still been raised regarding the appropriateness for assessing the internal dose by hair analysis so far. From two aspects of heavy metals and organic contaminants, this review summaries the research progress on analytical methodologies, exposure assessment, associations with internal/external indicators, distinction between endogenous and exogenous sources, health effects, and health-based reference values of environmental pollutants in human hair. It is indicated that cleaning is a key step in the methods of hair analysis. Pollutants in hair derived from both endogenous and exogenous contamination. Besides the incorporation in hair through the bloodstream (internal dose), pollutants may also be present in hair due to external exposure from air, dust, etc. Washing procedures for collected hair samples prior to analysis has been showed to be the most effective way to remove exogenous contamination, particularly for heavy metals. Organic solvent, surfactant, and deionized water are the most frequently used washing methods for hair analysis of organic pollutants; however, the applicability for the variety of organic pollutants is still questioned. Until now, extensive studies have reported the occurrence of environmental pollutants in human hair, but the lack of standard analytical methods makes it difficult for the information comparison. Another disadvantage is the limited evidence for the association between hair and body burden of pollutants. Although relevance between hair and environmental matrix, e.g., dust, air, and water have been indicated, inconsistent results were reported between hair and other internal indicators, e.g., blood, serum, and urine, except for arsenic (As) and selenium (Se), which have reached consensus for the correlations between hair and traditional indicators to some degree. Compared to heavy metals, relatively few studies have investigated the associations of organic pollutants between hair and endogenous tissues, which focused mainly on organohalogenated pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and other persistent organic pollutants. Besides the varied results on the significance of correlations between hair and blood, the correlation coefficients were generally low for most of the reported organic pollutants. These observations were commonly attributed to exogenous pollution, which highlight the importance of identifying internal and external sources of contaminants. In recent years, composition patterns, chiral signatures, and specific metabolites were successfully used to distinguish between the internal and external exposure sources of organic pollutants in hair. Nevertheless, the limitations of these methods implied that the internal and external sources of hair pollutants remain a controversial issue. Many studies, as yet, have assessed the health effects of heavy metals in hair, whereas the establishment of health-based reference values, except for As and mercury (Hg), is rather difficult since confounding factors impose restrictions on the interpretation of individual results. Meanwhile, no study, as far as we know, has investigated the health effects, nor yet reference values, of novel organic pollutants in human hair. The general consensus is that some scientific issues should be resolved before human hair can be accepted as a useful tool in evaluating internal exposure to environmental pollutants. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on hair analysis should focus on the elucidation of transport mechanisms of pollutants into hair and associations of pollutants between hair and blood/urine. It is necessary to undertake epidemiological studies based on hair analysis of organic pollutants as well as the formulation of health-based reference values. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Many persistent and low-cost pesticides are regularly used for domestic, agricultural, and industrial purpose. Bioaccumulation and toxicity of pesticides have raised environmental concerns, highlighting the need for effective removal techniques by using nanomaterials. The ability of hybrid nitrogen incorporated bismuth oxide with stannous oxide (N-Bi2O3@SnO2) were utilized for the removal of Ethion (ET) and Toxaphene (TP) pesticides. Leaves of A. indica (commonly found plant in India) employed as a natural surfactant and deionised water as a greener solvent. The purity and crystallinity of the deformed spherical nanoparticle (10–80 nm) were ensured by the sharp peaks acquired by PXRD. Subsequently, N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite was investigated for the elimination of pesticides at discrete reaction parameters (pollutant: 2–10 mgL−1; catalyst: 15–35 mg; pH: 3–11, dark-sunlight). N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite showed maximum degradation (ET:96 % and TP:90 %) with 30 mg catalytic dosage, at initial concentration of pesticide (2 mgL−1) at neutral pH under sunlight irradiation. Larger surface area (75 m2g−1), more negative value of zeta potential (–23.4 mV), and lower bandgap (2.1 eV) supported the effective photocatalytic efficiency of N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite. The presence of holes, O2, and OH radicals were responsible for the breakdown of the complex structure of ET and TP, confirmed by scavenger analysis. Safer metabolites formed after degradation confirmed by GC–MS analysis. Conclusively, by virtues greater efficiency of reusability (n = 8), stability, and greater charge separation, hybrid N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite may prove as an alternative catalyst for industrial application with intense scope. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Blood is the most widely used matrix for biomonitoring of persistent organic pollutants (POPs). It is assumed that POPs are homogenously distributed within body lipids at steady state; however, the variability underlying the partitioning of POPs between fat compartments is poorly understood. Hence, the objective of this study was to review the state of the science about the relationships of POPs between adipose tissue and serum in humans. We conducted a narrative literature review of human observational studies reporting concentrations of POPs in paired samples of adipose tissue with other lipid-based compartments (e.g., serum lipids). The searches were conducted in SCOPUS and PUBMED. A meta-regression was performed to identify factors responsible for variability. All included studies reported high variability in the partition coefficients of POPs, mainly between adipose tissue and serum. The number of halogen atoms was the physicochemical variable most strongly and positively associated with the partition ratios, whereas body mass index was the main biological factor positively and significantly associated. To conclude, although this study provides a better understanding of partitioning of POPs to refine physiologically based pharmacokinetic and epidemiological models, further research is still needed to determine other key factors involved in the partitioning of POPs. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Intertrochanteric fractures are common injuries around the hip, especially among the elderly. With the rising incidence of these injuries, they are expected to double by 2050. Incidence rates are higher in females than males and in white patients than black African patients. Osteoporosis weakens the local trochanteric anatomic support leading to an increased susceptibility to fractures. Disruption of the posteromedial calcar region results in fracture instability. Optimal lag screw position and fracture reduction are significant determinants for postoperative outcomes. The tip apex distance and reduction criteria determine lag screw cut-out risk and fracture reduction quality, respectively. A calcar-referenced tip apex distance is comparable if not better than the tip apex distance in predicting cut-out risk. Optimal reduction is in slight valgus, a positive medial cortex apposition and smooth anterior cortex apposition. High mortality rates are observed with non-surgical treatment. Surgical management is therefore the gold standard for intertrochanteric fractures. Treatment options are categorised into extramedullary fixation, intramedullary fixation and proximal femur replacement. They include the dynamic hip screw (DHS), cephalomedullary nails (CMN) and arthroplasty. Although still in use, the proximal femur locking plate is falling out of favour due to high complication rates. Fracture stability and pattern influence the treatment choice. There is, however, a growing use of CMNs which has been attributed to surgical training background. Modification of older CMN designs has improved treatment outcomes. Systematic meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) do not show superiority of one treatment option over another; therefore, there is no consensus on the best treatment choice. The proximal femur nail antirotation (PFNA) has better outcomes compared to other fixation options with respect to intraoperative blood loss and Harris hip scores. As a group, CMNs have a better 120-day postoperative quality of life compared to the DHS. No significant difference in complications has been found between treatment options. In light of the anticipated increased incidence of intertrochanteric fracture, more work is needed in planning national resource allocation, devising preventative methods and improving clinical interventions in South Africa. © 2023 Sukati FM.},

	abstract = {Occupational exposure as a firefighter has recently been classified as a carcinogen to humans by International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). Biomonitoring has been increasingly used to characterize exposure of firefighting forces to contaminants. However, available data are dispersed and information on the most relevant and promising biomarkers in this context of firefighting is missing. This review presents a comprehensive summary and critical appraisal of existing biomarkers of exposure including volatile organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, several other persistent other organic pollutants as well as heavy metals and metalloids detected in biological fluids of firefighters attending different fire scenarios. Urine was the most characterized matrix, followed by blood. Firefighters exhaled breath and saliva were poorly evaluated. Overall, biological levels of compounds were predominantly increased in firefighters after participation in firefighting activities. Biomonitoring studies combining different biomarkers of exposure and of effect are currently limited but exploratory findings are of high interest. However, biomonitoring still has some unresolved major limitations since reference or recommended values are not yet established for most biomarkers. In addition, half-lives values for most of the biomarkers have thus far not been defined, which significantly hampers the design of studies. These limitations need to be tackled urgently to improve risk assessment and support implementation of better more effective preventive strategies. © 2023 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Evidence of the adverse metabolic health effects of perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is increasing. However, the impact of PFAS on cardiovascular diseases remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the impact of PFAS on the stroke risk. Databases were searched for studies published up to November 1, 2022, which report the association between stroke and exposure to at least one of four main PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS], perfluorononanoic acid [PFNA], and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid [PFHxS]). Data extraction and quality assessment were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Four studies were included in this systematic review. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident stroke per 1-log unit increment in each serum PFAS were combined in the meta-analysis. The risk of development of stroke was not significantly associated with PFOA, PFOS, or PFNA exposure (PFOA: pooled odds ratio [OR]=1.001, 95 % confidence interval [CI]=0.975-1.028, p=0.934; PFOS: pooled OR=0.994, 95 % CI=0.972-1.017, p=0.601; PFNA: pooled OR=1.016, 95 % CI=0.920-1.123, p=0.752), whereas a moderately lower risk was associated with PFHxS exposure without statistical significance (pooled OR=0.953, 95 % CI=0.908-1.001, p=0.054). PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA exposure showed a neutral association, while PFHxS showed a possible inverse association with the risk of stroke. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution. Further prospective observational studies with PFAS mixture analyses are warranted.  © 2023 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.},

	abstract = {Aim: Alcohol is a commonly co-ingested compound during self-poisoning with pesticides. Clinical experiences suggest alcohol co-ingestion (or withdrawal) makes patient management more difficult after self-poisoning and may contribute to poor clinical outcomes. We aimed to systematically review the world literature to explore the relationship between alcohol co-ingestion and outcome in pesticide self-poisoning. Methods: We searched 13 electronic databases and Google scholar, conducted citation searching and a review of reference lists to find studies which investigated the relationship of alcohol with clinical outcome of pesticide self-poisoning in different countries. Thirteen studies, including 11 case series/reports and two cohort studies were considered for inclusion. Results: Meta-analysis showed that alcohol co-ingestion in pesticide self-poisoning was associated with increased risk of death [odds ratio (OR) 4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-8.2 P<0.0001] and that alcohol co-ingested group required intubation eight times more often than non-co-ingested group in organophosphorus insecticide self-poisoning (OR 8.0, 95% CI 4.9-13.0 P<0.0001). Cases who co-ingested alcohol were older than non-alcohol group in two studies. One cohort study demonstrated that alcohol co-ingestion was associated with larger pesticide ingestions but did not itself affect the outcome. Conclusions: This systematic review indicates that alcohol co-ingestion may worsen clinical outcome in pesticide self-poisoning.  © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Ammonium 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy)-propanoate (HFPO-DA) is a short chain member of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). To better understand the relevance of histopathological effects seen in livers of mice exposed to HFPO-DA for human health risk assessment, histopathological effects were summarized from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained sections in several repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice. Findings across studies revealed histopathological changes consistent with peroxisomal proliferation, whereas two reports of steatosis could not be confirmed in the published figures. In addition, mechanisms of hepatocellular death were assessed in H&E sections as well as with the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 (CCasp3) in newly cut sections from archived liver blocks from select studies. A comparison of serially CCasp3 immunolabeled and H&E-stained sections revealed that mechanisms of hepatocellular death cannot be clearly discerned in H&E-stained liver sections alone as several examples of putatively necrotic cells were positive for CCasp3. Published whole genome transcriptomic data were also reevaluated for enrichment of various forms of hepatocellular death in response to HFPO-DA, which revealed enrichment of apoptosis and autophagy, but not ferroptosis, pyroptosis, or necroptosis. These morphological and molecular findings are consistent with transcriptomic evidence for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling in HFPO-DA exposed mice. © The Author(s) 2023.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Pesticides are toxic and biological substances used for mitigating harmful pests. Their application in agricultural fields and homes increased environmental pollution. Studies showed their harmful effects on human health, specifically children, who are more vulnerable than adults. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has introduced several pesticides as carcinogens. This study aims to systematically summarize and review all studies related to pesticides and cancer. Methodology: This systematic review is based on PRISMA rules. Three central databases were employed to find studies on pesticide exposure and cancer correlation published from 2017 to September 2022. Results: After reviewing several studies, we found that most studies revealed a significant relationship between pesticide exposure and an increased cancer incidence rate. Among the most studied group of pesticides is organochlorine (OC) pesticides. OC pesticides and their residues could significantly increase cancer in children and adults. Mechanistic studies revealed that pesticides could increase the risk of different cancers by genetics, like an increased expression of some genes like p21, p53 or epigenetic impairments. Cell cycle impairments like expanding the G1 to S phase transition are another mechanism of causing cancer. DNA methylation and histone modifications increase the risk of numerous cancers. Conclusion: Based on epidemiological studies, pesticides are a significant concern to human health, specifically cancer development, and should be more restrained. Their most reported mechanism of action were genetic and epigenetic impairments which cause cancers. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and its alternative 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) are ubiquitous in various environmental and human samples. They have been reported to have hepatotoxicity effects, but the potential mechanisms remain unclear. Herein, we integrated metabolomics and proteomics analysis to investigate the altered profiles in metabolite and protein levels in primary human hepatocytes (PHH) exposed to 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS at human exposure relevant concentrations. Our results showed that 6:2 Cl-PFESA exhibited higher perturbation effects on cell viability, metabolome and proteome than PFOS. Integration of metabolomics and proteomics revealed that the alteration of glycerophospholipid metabolism was the critical pathway of 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS-induced lipid metabolism disorder in primary human hepatocytes. Interestingly, 6:2 Cl-PFESA-induced cellular metabolic process disorder was associated with the cellular membrane-bounded signaling pathway, while PFOS was associated with the intracellular transport process. Moreover, the disruption effects of 6:2 Cl-PFESA were also involved in inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling system. Overall, this study provided comprehensive insights into the hepatic lipid toxicity mechanisms of 6:2 Cl-PFESA and PFOS in human primary hepatocytes. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), recognized worldwide as emerging pollutants, may pose a substantial threat to human health and our environment due to their stability, high concentrations, wide distribution, and easy accumulation. Ever since perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were recognized by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the public has become increasingly concerned about potential contamination and the environmental risks associated with PFASs. Ubiquitous PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and sediment has been detected, especially in areas with rapid industrial and economic development. Its accumulation in living organisms and foods has accentuated the importance of investigations into aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, as the stability and integrity of the food web as well as the population quantity and structure of the aquatic ecosystem may be affected. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the toxic and toxicity-related effects of PFASs on aquatic plankton, aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms, the characteristics of different target aquatic organisms in toxicity investigations, and a feasibility evaluation of PFAS substitutes to provide valuable suggestions for further utilization and regulation of PFASs and their substitutes. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Objective: This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of pioglitazone on Parkinson's disease (PD) in diabetes patients. Methods: A study search was carried out in PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases from inception to July 22, 2021. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used to evaluate the quality of the eligible studies. The risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were used as effect size indicators in this meta-analysis to evaluate the risk association between pioglitazone and PD. The Cochran's Q and I2 tests were used to assess statistical heterogeneity. A dose–response meta-analysis was conducted using the least squares trend estimation method. Results: Three studies were eligible for this meta-analysis. Compared with diabetes patients who did not use pioglitazone, there was a significant reduction in the risk of PD (RR of 0.87 [95 % CI 0.62–0.99, P = 0.039]) in pioglitazone users. No significant difference in PD risk was noted in diabetes patients taking 438 dose-duration-days (DDDs) of pioglitazone or lower compared with those who did not. When the DDD of pioglitazone was 438, the RR was 0.85 (95 % CI [0.72–1.00], P = 0.05). When the DDD of pioglitazone was > 438, the risk of PD in patients with diabetes was significantly decreased (P < 0.05) and showed an approximate linear correlation trend. Conclusion: Pioglitazone administration in PD in diabetes patients is significantly associated with a decrease in the risk of PD. © 2022},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are fluorinated substances that contain at least one completely fluorinated methyl or methylene carbon atom (without any H/Cl/Br/I connected to the carbon atom). Because of the excellent thermal stability, high surface activity, lipophobicity and hydrophobicity, they are widely used in different fields such as non-stick coatings, dental floss, and aqueous film-forming foams. PFASs inevitably enter the environments by industrial and domestic emissions, and exist stably in the environment. In recent years, PFASs pollution becomes a global environmental problem. Microorganisms are an indispensable part of the ecosystems, acting as an important participant in the material cycle and energy flow. Both microbial surfaces and PFASs are relatively hydrophobic, and hydrophobic interaction facilitates PFASs to contact microorganisms, which further inhibit their activity. In turn, microorganisms could affect the transformation and fate of PFASs. Therefore, it is of importance to systematically summarize the interaction between PFASs and microorganisms in order to provide critical information for better understanding the environmental risks of PFASs. This review systematically expounded the interaction between PFASs and environmental microorganisms. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of PFASs to bacteria was highlighted. It was found that PFASs could promote the synthesis and release of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and affect the composition and structure of EPS, thereby inhibiting the activity of extracellular enzymes or destroying the integrity of biofilm. In addition, hydrophobic interaction promoted the penetration of PFASs to the phospholipid bilayer, increasing the fluidity and permeability of the membrane. Furthermore, the increase of membrane permeability caused bacterial metabolism disorder, which resulted in the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS could oxidize unsaturated fatty acids to malondialdehyde (MDA), and induce cross-linking of nucleic acids and lead to DNA damage. Secondly, this review elucidated the impact of PFASs on the microbial communities in the environments. In the soil and freshwater environments, the changes of bacterial abundance are mainly regulated by PFASs concentrations. It is worth noting that PFASs at high concentration (>10 mg/kg) reduced the abundance of bacteria related to soil nitrogen transformation and phosphorus metabolism, thus posing a potential threat to the cycling capacities of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. Additionally, sulfur cycle and nitrification process in freshwater environment are inhibited by high-concentration PFASs (>10 mg/L). In terms of the marine environment, the impact of PFASs on microbial communities was much lower than that of environmental parameters (e.g., nutrient substances and salinity). Finally, the microbial transformation pathway of PFASs was discussed. The biofilm formed by microorganisms and their extracellular secretions could adsorb and transform/degrade PFASs by different reactions (e.g., Feammox, desulfurization and hydrolysis), mediating by extracellular enzymes (e.g., C-SO3− bond lyase, phosphatase and polyurethane enzyme), thus affecting the toxicity and fate of PFASs. Moreover, the challenges and future perspectives were addressed. PFASs in the biofilm could be transferred to the organisms at higher trophic level through the parasitic or predatory food chains. Therefore, the risk of PFASs along the microbe-based food chain should be further investigated. In addition, microorganisms existed in the environments usually in the form of community. Current research on the molecular mechanisms of PFASs on microbial quorum sensing is relatively lacking, and deserves an in-depth investigation. Finally, due to the lack of some metabolite standards and instrument detection limit, there are still unidentified transformation products in the biotransformation pathways of PFASs. The issues highlighted above are suggested to be focused on the further investigations. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Depersonalization-Derealization disorder (DDD) is a psychiatric condition characterized by persistent feelings of detachment from one’s self and of unreality about the outside world. This review aims to examine the prevalence of DDD amongst different populations. A systematic review protocol was developed before literature searching. Original articles were drawn from three electronic databases and included only studies where prevalence rates of DDD were assessed by standardized diagnostic tools. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Twenty-three papers were identified and categorized into three groups of participants: general population, mixed in/outpatient samples, and patients with specific disorders. The prevalence rates ranged from 0% to 1.9% amongst the general population, 5–20% in outpatients and 17.5–41.9% in inpatients. In studies of patients with specific disorders, prevalence rates varied: 1.8–5.9% (substance abuse), 3.3–20.2% (anxiety), 3.7–20.4% (other dissociative disorders), 16.3% (schizophrenia), 17% (borderline personality disorder), ~50% (depression). The highest rates were found in people who experienced interpersonal abuse (25–53.8%). The prevalence rate of DDD is around 1% in the general population, consistent with previous findings. DDD is more prevalent amongst adolescents and young adults as well as in patients with mental disorders. There is also a possible relationship between interpersonal abuse and DDD, which merits further research. © 2022 The Author(s). Published with license by Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

Meanwhile, the scale of global production of emerging chemicals has increased dramatically, but limited instrumental resources, high cost of in vivo studies, and large knowledge gaps about existing and emerging pollutants make hazard assessment extremely challenging. This chapter reviews the applications of quantitative structure–activity relationship (QSAR) models in marine ecological risk assessment, gives gain deep insight into the global trends, and provides references and perspectives for future research. This systematic review is expected to help understanding of reasonable arrangements of limited resources and laboratory tests for the continuously emerging commercial chemicals and realizing opportunities to use QSAR models for assessing marine environmental risk of emerging pollutants. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

	abstract = {In this study, we investigated the role of tumor microenvironment and serum differential metabolites in intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) carcinogenesis, providing new evidence for ICC treatment. Serum samples from healthy individuals and ICC patients were collected for metabolomic analysis. The purine metabolites such as inosine, guanosine, hypoxanthine, and xanthine were increased in patient serum. TCGA database samples were collected, and the correlation between purine metabolism-related genes and ICC clinical features was analyzed using R language to obtain the differential genes including PPAT, PFAS, ATIC, and IMPDH2. High PPAT expression was associated with poor ICC prognosis. A PPAT silencing model in HCCC-9810 cells was constructed. The cell phenotype was examined by qRT-PCR, CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry, showing a decrease in IMPDH1 expression, colony and invasive cells numbers, and an increase in apoptosis. Guanosine reversed IMPDH1 expression in HCCC-9810 cells, promoting the secretion of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-8, OPN, VEGF, and VCAM-1 and intensifying epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) progression in the cells. In nude mice, the IMPDH1 inhibitory drug MMF inhibited tumor growth and reduced the expression of tumor stem cell characteristic markers CD133 and SOX2. Guanosine accelerated the malignant progression of ICC inhibition of purine metabolism-related genes, PPAT and IMPDH2, suppressed the malignant phenotype in HCCC-9810 cells, and inhibited tumor growth.  © 2023 Chang-Jun Liu et al.},

Objective: This study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impacts of OP pesticides on semen quality and male reproductive hormones. Methods: This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocols. Strategic search was conducted using combined text words as search terms. The eligibility criteria were developed based on Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, and Study designs (PECOS) framework. Relevant data were extracted, risk of bias was evaluated by The Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) tool, and certainty of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group guidelines. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed by using Review Manager. Results: A total of 766 male subjects (349 exposed to OP pesticides and 417 unexposed controls) were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in the ejaculate volume, seminal fluid volume, sperm multiple anomaly index, sperm, and leukocytes levels of the OP-exposed subjects compared to the control. In addition, OP pesticides exposure did not significantly affect serum concentrations of FSH, LH, and testosterone in subjects who were exposed to OP pesticides compared to their unexposed counterparts. However, we found a significant reduction in the sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive sperm motility, total sperm motility, and normal sperm morphology of OP pesticides-exposed subjects compared to the unexposed subjects. However, after subtype and sensitivity analyses, exposure to OP pesticides did not reduce sperm count. Also, after sensitivity analysis, OP pesticides exposure did not alter progressive sperm motility. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that OP pesticides exposure reduced sperm count, concentration, total and progressive motility, and normal sperm morphology, possibly via a testosterone-independent mechanism.

Fold change analysis of the metabolome revealed the effect of DDT on bile acid biosynthesis. Gene expression of the related enzyme in rat liver samples was also quantified. Significant association was found between DDT and gene expression levels related to constitutive androstane receptor mediated enzymes, such as Cyp2b1 in rat livers. However, our results could not fully demonstrate that enzymes related to bile acid biosynthesis were strongly affected by DDT. The correlation between DDT concentration and gene expression involved in steroid hormone synthesis in testis was also evaluated; however, no significant correlation was found. The disturbance of metabolic enzymes occurred in rat liver in the target area. Our results suggest that DDT exposure affects gene expression in wild rats living in DDT-sprayed areas. Therefore, there is a need for DDT toxicity evaluation in mammals living in DDT-sprayed areas. We could not find an effective biomarker that could reflect the mechanism of DDT exposure; however, this approach can provide new insights for future research to evaluate DDT effects in sprayed areas. © 2023 The Japanese Society of Veterinary Science.},

	abstract = {Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been widely used around the world due to their high-efficiency and broad-spectrum insecticidal effects. However, they pose a severe threat to ecosystems and human health due to their easy bioaccumulation and high toxicity. Periphyton is ubiquitous in the submerged substrates surface. It plays a crucial role in carbon, nutrients elements cycling and contaminants transformation in environment. Periphyton can remove OCPs through bioadsorption, bioaccumulation and biodegradation, which alters the fate of OCPs in environment. This review presents a comprehensive summary of OCPs occurrence, global cycle, potential harm in environment, and their removal by periphyton. The OCPs residual have been detected frequently in different environmental medias such as water, soil, atmosphere, sediment, and organisms. Their harm is depending on their physicochemical properties and the exposure route. The main compositions and functions of periphyton have been summarized. Moreover, the artificial cultivation methods of periphyton in laboratory and in-situ field are compared. In addition, the mechanisms of periphyton-mediated OCPs removal and the main factors impacting OCPs removal are also discussed. Periphyton could self-regulate its biological communities to adapt to the OCPs and environment, and then regenerate new species to degrade OCPs. Finally, the prospect of OCPs removal by periphyton and future studies are also proposed. This review provides a systematic introduction on current knowledge of OCPs occurrence, cycle, potential harm in environment, and their removal by periphyton. © 2023 China Three Gorges University.

	abstract = {Background: Emerging evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the etiology of diabetes. Objectives: This study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS with mortality and morbidity of diabetes and to quantitatively evaluate the summary effect estimates of the existing literature. Methods: We searched three electronic databases for epidemiological studies concerning PFAS and diabetes published before April 1, 2022. Summary odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), or β and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were respectively calculated to evaluate the association between PFAS and diabetes using random-effects model by the exposure type, and dose-response meta-analyses were also performed when possible. We also assessed the risk of bias of the studies included and the confidence in the body of evidence. Results: An initial literature search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 studies were eventually included. The meta-analyses indicated that the observed statistically significant PFAS-T2DM associations were consistent in cohort studies, while the associations were almost non-significant in case-control and cross-sectional studies. Dose-response meta-analysis showed a “parabolic-shaped” association between perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) exposure and T2DM risk. Available evidence was rated with “low” risk of bias, and the level of evidence for PFAS and incident T2DM was considered “moderate”. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure may increase the risk of incident T2DM, and that PFOA may exert non-monotonic dose-response effect on T2DM risk. Considering the widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects of PFAS, further cohort studies with improvements in expanding the sample size, adjusting the covariates, and considering different types of PFAS exposure at various doses, are needed to elucidate the putative causal associations and potential mode of action of different PFAS on diabetes. Impact Statement: A growing body of evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the development of diabetes. However, epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS and diabetes is inconsistent. We performed this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to PFAS may increase diabetes risk among the general population. Reduced exposure to these “forever and everywhere chemicals” may be an important preventative approach to reducing the risk of diabetes across the population. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature America, Inc.},

	abstract = {The metabolites in exhaled breath (EB) dynamically reflect the metabolic status of the human body and can serve as biomarkers for health management and disease diagnosis. However, there is currently a lack of clinical diagnostic methods for rapid metabolite detection in EB samples and metabolomic data processing. In this project, we develop a method that uses a collecting device to efficiently collect exhaled breath samples on perfluoroethylene propylene (FEP) modified silicon nanowires (SiNWs). The sample chips are directly detected by nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS), and the mass spectrometry (MS) results are collected as a dataset and analyzed by machine learning techniques. FEP@SiNWs chips improved metabolite trapping efficiency and laser desorption/ionization efficiency during sample collection and mass spectrometry detection, enabling rapid metabolomic analysis with good stability and detection repeatability. Through machine learning technology, the MS information of metabolites in EB samples of patients with pulmonary nodules and healthy people was processed, the characteristic peaks were selected, and the prediction accuracy (>95.4 %) and sensitivity (92.6 - 98.5 %) of the machine learning model were tested. Based on this work, the collecting device and FEP@SiNWs chips have the potential to be used as home health management devices, and a metabolomic database of respiratory diseases via exhaled breath samples can be established in future research, which can be applied to respiratory disease diagnosis and intelligent healthcare.  © 2023 IEEE.},

	abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) is a large group of fluorinated synthetic chemicals, e. g., perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Many epidemiological studies have found that PFAS exposure is associated with hypertension risk, but others possess a different opinion. Overall, the relationship between PFASs and hypertension risk remains controversial. We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between PFAS exposure and human risk of hypertension. We conducted a meta-analysis based on population-involving studies published from 1975 to 2023, which we collected from Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases. The odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD), with their 95% confidence interval (CI), were used to assess the risk of hypertension with PFAS exposure. The statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the Q-test and I2 statistics. Research publications related to our meta-analysis topic were systematically reviewed. Fourteen studies involving 71,663 participants, in which 26,281 suffered hypertension, met the inclusion criteria. Our analyses suggest that exposure to general PFAS (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04-1.14) or PFOS (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05-1.30) is associated with hypertension risk. Specifically, elevated levels of general PFAS (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.08-0.42), PFHxS (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.07-0.27), and PFDA (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.02-0.13) are associated with a high risk of hypertension. Our meta-analysis indicates that PFAS exposure is a risk factor for hypertension, and increased hypertension risk is associated with higher PFAS levels. Further study may eventually provide a better and more comprehensive elucidation of the potential mechanism of this association. © 2023, International Heart Journal Association.

	abstract = {Catalyzed reduction processes have been recognized as important and supplementary technologies for water treatment, with the specific aims of resource recovery, enhancement of bio/chemical-treatability of persistent organic pollutants, and safe handling of oxygenate ions. Palladium (Pd) has been widely used as a catalyst/electrocatalyst in these reduction processes. However, due to the limited reserves and high cost of Pd, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the Pd-catalyzed decontamination process to design affordable and sustainable Pd catalysts. This review provides a systematic summary of recent advances in understanding Pd-catalyzed reductive decontamination processes and designing Pd-based nanocatalysts for the reductive treatment of water-borne pollutants, with special focus on the interactions and transformation mechanisms of pollutant molecules on Pd catalysts at the atomic scale. The discussion begins by examining the adsorption of pollutants onto Pd sites from a thermodynamic viewpoint. This is followed by an explanation of the molecular-level reaction mechanism, demonstrating how electron-donors participate in the reductive transformation of pollutants. Next, the influence of the Pd reactive site structure on catalytic performance is explored. Additionally, the process of Pd-catalyzed reduction in facilitating the oxidation of pollutants is briefly discussed. The longevity of Pd catalysts, a crucial factor in determining their practicality, is also examined. Finally, we argue for increased attention to mechanism study, as well as precise construction of Pd sites under batch synthesis conditions, and the use of Pd-based catalysts/electrocatalysts in the treatment of concentrated pollutants to facilitate resource recovery. © 2024 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Micro- and nanoplastics (MNPs) are emerging pollutants with scarcely investigated effects on human innate immunity. If they follow a similar course of action as other, more thoroughly investigated particulates, MNPs may penetrate epithelial barriers, potentially triggering a cascade of signaling events leading to cell damage and inflammation. Inflammasomes are intracellular multiprotein complexes and stimulus-induced sensors critical for mounting inflammatory responses upon recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns. Among these, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most studied in terms of activation via particulates. However, studies delineating the ability of MNPs to affect NLRP3 inflammasome activation are still rare. In this review, we address the issue of MNPs source and fate, highlight the main concepts of inflammasome activation via particulates, and explore recent advances in using inflammasome activation for assessment of MNP immunotoxicity. We also discuss the impact of co-exposure and MNP complex chemistry in potential inflammasome activation. Development of robust biological sensors is crucial in order to maximize global efforts to effectively address and mitigate risks that MNPs pose for human health.

Data Source: The authors conducted a non-systematic review of articles published in English, Portuguese, French, and Spanish in the last decade in the following databases: PubMed, Google Scholar, EMBASE, and SciELO. The keywords used were: microplastics OR nanoplastics OR marine litter OR toxicology OR additives AND human health OR children OR adults. Data summary: MPs are a group of emerging contaminants that have attracted scientific interest and societal attention in the last decade due to their ubiquitous detection in all environments. Humans can primarily be exposed to MPs and nanoplastics via oral and inhalation routes, but dermal contact cannot be overlooked, especially in young children. The possible toxic effects of plastic particles are due to their potential toxicity, often combined with that of leachable additives and adsorbed contaminants. Conclusions: Unless the plastic value chain is transformed over the next two decades, the risks to species, marine ecosystems, climate, health, economy, and communities will be unmanageable. However, along with these risks are the unique opportunities to help transition to a more sustainable world. © 2023 Codon Publications. Published by Codon Publications.},

	abstract = {This review presents the findings of a comprehensive investigation that involved a systematic search, critical analysis, and synthesis of scientific evidence regarding the impact of a broad range of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), on the reproductive functions, postembryonic survival, and morphofunctional development of offspring in the aquarium fish species Danio rerio, commonly known as Zebrafish. These fish are extensively utilized in experimental studies to simulate carcinogenic, mutagenic, and general toxic effects. The literature search was conducted using Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and eLIBRARY.RU databases following the PRISMA 2020 recommendations. A total of 613 articles were identified, out of which 14 were selected for detailed analysis. Among them, 11 focused on assessing the impact of PCB exposure on the reproductive system of Danio rerio. Additionally, 8 articles reported on the results of studying the effects of parental exposure to PCBs on the viability and postembryonic development of their offspring. The adverse effects of PCBs, either alone or in combination with other POPs, have been studied to a lesser extent in male Danio rerio compared to females. Furthermore, the transmission of morphological and functional disorders to subsequent generations resulting from separate parental exposure to PCBs in both sexes, as well as the dose-response relationship, have not been adequately assessed based on the published works. Moreover, developmental disorders in offspring have mostly been studied for the first generation following parental exposure to mixtures of POPs and PCBs. The lack of such information hinders a proper evaluation of the transgenerational risk inheritance phenomenon, specifically regarding the transmission of morphological and functional disorders associated with progenitor exposure to PCBs and other environmental endocrine-disrupting pollutants. The findings of this analysis can be used for planning experimental quantitative assessments, predicting, and preventing impairments to human reproductive health, and safeguarding the well-being of future generations. © Eco-Vector, 2023.},

	abstract = {Microplastics and antibiotics are emerging pollutants that inevitably enter the sludge anaerobic digestion system. Current studies mainly focused on the individual effects of microplastics or antibiotics on methane generation. However, there may also be complex reactions between them and their combine effects on anaerobic digestion remain unclear. This study revealed the combined influencing mechanism of polyamide and ofloxacin through batch and semi-continuous tests. Brief exposure to ofloxacin was detrimental to methane production. The coexistence of polyamide enabled partial adsorption of ofloxacin, which effectively mitigates the inhibitory effect of ofloxacin at low concentrations. Polyamide also facilitated the colonization of hydrolytic bacteria and acidogens, such as Hydrogenispora, and promoted the conversion of organic matter to acetate. However, polyamide could not effectively alleviate the inhibitory effect of excess ofloxacin on anaerobic digestion. Ofloxacin at high concentrations stimulated the release of humic acid, reduced methane production by more than 80%, and changed the predominant methanogenesis pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Acidogenesis and methanogenesis pathways were restructured to further explore the effect of ofloxacin on the metabolic potentials of microorganisms. Metagenomic analysis revealed that most of functional genes associated with glycolysis, amino acid metabolism and methanogenesis were down regulated under long-term stress of high concentration of ofloxacin. This study elucidated the microbial process of organic matter conversion inhibition by ofloxacin, shed light on the combined effects of polyamide and ofloxacin on anaerobic digestion and provided new insights for assessing the impact of multiple pollutants on the safe disposal of sludge. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Dumpsites are reservoirs of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals (HMs), constituting environmental hazards to humanity. Autochthonous microorganisms in dumpsites exhibit various degrees of responses to contaminants. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of information on the types and concentration of pollutants and the array of microorganisms in these dumpsites which may play important roles in the metabolism of such pollutants or other community processes. Therefore, determining the microbial community structure in such contaminated sites across a municipality is essential for profiling the taxa that would serve as consensus degraders of the pollutants. In this study, soil samples from three dumpsites (Cele, CS; Solous, SS; and Computer Village, CVS) were characterized for geochemical properties using GC-MS, MP-AES, and other analytical protocols, while the dynamics of bacterial communities were evaluated based on their 16S rRNA gene barcodes. A significant difference in the bacterial communities was observed among the dumpsites in relation to the extent of pollution caused by POPs and HMs. CVS, with the highest HM contamination, was rich in Actinobacteria (41.7%) and Acidobacteria (10.2%), in contrast to CS and SS. Proteobacteria (34.1%) and Firmicutes (20%) were the dominant phyla in CS (highest POP contamination), while Bacteroidetes (45.5%) and Proteobacteria (39.9%) were dominant in SS soil. Bacillus was the dominant genus in the most polluted dumpsite. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and HMs shaped the structure of the bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the most polluted dumpsite. Out of a total of 706 OTUs, 628 OTUs exhibited a significant correlation (>50%) with benzo(b)fluoranthene, azobenzene, dibenzofurans, pyrene, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene, Cu, and Zn. In particular, Proteobacteria (Achromobacter sp. and Serratia sp.), Bacteroidetes (Zhouia sp.), and Firmicutes (Bacillus sp.) were suggested to be pivotal to the ecophysiology of dumpsite soils contaminated with POPs and HMs. The results generally underscored the importance of metagenomic and physicochemical analyses of polluted systems in enabling correlations for useful prediction of drivers of such ecosystems. This will further improve our understanding of the metabolic potential and adaptation of organisms in such systems. Copyright © 2023 Saibu, Adebusoye, Oyetibo and Rodrigues.},

	abstract = {Demand for rice labeled as organic is growing globally. Consumers state that foods labeled as organic are nutritionally superior and safer than their conventionally produced equivalent. The research question for this systematic review is as follows: is there a difference between the effects of sustainable agriculture and conventional farming methods on rice grain end-use quality, healthfulness, and safety? The studies (n = 23) examined for this review suggest that organic production practices don’t influence most end-use quality (e.g., chalk, milling yield, pasting properties) and healthfulness (e.g., gamma-oryzanol fraction and tocols) traits studied, or if it does, it will be to a small degree. If differences in end-use quality traits are found, they will be associated with grain protein content, which varies along with the dose of nitrogen applied during rice growth. We conclude that the studies evaluated in this review found that organically produced rice grain was less likely to contain residues of the pesticides (e.g., organochlorine) examined in the study than the rice is grown using conventional methods. There was some evidence that organically grown rice is more likely to be contaminated with mycotoxin-producing fungi and some mycotoxins. Common shortcomings of the studies were that they were poorly designed, with limited to no details of the cultural management practices used to grow the rice studied, the length of time fields was under organic management not stated, cultivars were not named, and the data wasn’t analyzed statistically. © 2022 by the authors.},

Objective: Our purpose was to summarize the results of studies discussing the association between pesticides and male fertility. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed through MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Only human studies were considered. Semen parameters and DNA integrity were considered to evaluate the effect of pesticides on men. Results: A total of 64 studies that investigated their impact in terms of semen parameters (51 studies) and chromatin and DNA integrity (25 studies) were included. The most frequently affected parameters were total sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology, although a reduction in ejaculate volume and concentration occur in several cases. A tangible worsening of semen quality was associated with organochlorines and organophosphates. Furthermore, pesticide exposure, especially pyrethroids, was related to a higher DNA fragmentation index and chromosome aneuploidy in most articles. Conclusion: The epidemiological evidence supports the association between pesticides and male fertility for workers and the exposed population in terms of semen quality, DNA fragmentation, and chromosome aneuploidy. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Zinc ferrite is a type of photocatalytic material with high physicochemical stability, narrow band gap, high carrier separation efficiency, high porosity, and paramagnetism, which makes it easy to recover. Thus, zinc ferrite is widely used as a photocatalyst in water treatment. In this paper, the preparation principles as well as the advantages and disadvantages of typical methods used to prepare zinc ferrite including hydrothermal, co-precipitation, sol-gel, and other novel methods such as biosynthesis have been summarized. Modification methods such as elemental doping, composite formation, and morphological modification have been highlighted. Using these modification methods, the catalytic activity of zinc ferrite toward the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water has been enhanced. Biosynthesis is regarded as a promising preparation method that uses biological materials instead of chemical materials to achieve the large-scale preparation of zinc ferrite using low cost, energy efficient, and environmentally friendly processes. Meanwhile, the combination of multiple modification techniques to enhance the photocatalytic performance of zinc ferrite will be an important research trend in the future. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {In the Arctic, main sources of persistent organic pollutants and potentially toxic elements are industry and agriculture in the lower latitudes. However, there are also local sources of pollution. Our study was focused on possible pollution in the Finnish Lapland, transferred from the Pechenganikel industrial complex located in the borders of Russia, Finland and Norway. Local food items and blood samples of pregnant women from the Inari municipality were collected and organochlorine compounds (OCs) and metal(oid)s analyzed. Most of the examined food samples showed detectable levels of these compounds. The mean concentrations of DDTs and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) were higher in fish (0.18–0.32 ng/g and 0.34–0.64 ng/g, respectively), than in the other food groups (0.027–0.047 ng/g and 0.11–0.20 ng/g, respectively). PCBs were found at the highest concentrations in blood samples of the pregnant women, and congeners 153 and 118 were dominant. The mean concentration of PCB153, 0.29 μg/kg serum lipid, was lower than those described in many other studies. Concerning DDTs, the 4,4′-DDT/4,4′-DDE ratio, 0.092, in the blood samples was lower than that observed in the food items, 0.25–0.71, reflecting old uses of the DDT pesticide. None of the observed levels of selected potentially toxic elements in blood samples and in food items exceeded the known safe limits. Higher concentrations of PCB52 and γ-HCH were observed in the serum of pregnant women who consumed greater amounts of meat, and berries and mushrooms, respectively. The OC concentrations from the pregnant women currently studied were lower than those observed fourteen years ago with pregnant women from the same municipality. Compounds whose occurrence is likely related to a long-distance transport showed clear decreases, e.g., 63% for PCBs, and for those from pesticides, decreases were 93% and 97% for 4,4′-DDE and β-HCH, respectively. No obvious influence from the Pechenganikel complex is observed from the results. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Metal nanoparticles have garnered a significant interest in various fields of science because of their remarkable optical properties, and they have shown a great impact in improving the sensitivity of UV–Visible spectrometry, just like as expensive analytical instruments. Modifications of metal nanoparticles (Au, Ag and Cu) with specific ligands have shown great potentiality to establish miniaturized colorimetric assay of wide variety molecules, offering the quantification of trace level target analytes via the color changes, which could be noticed with naked-eye. The interface between the ligand chemistry of metal nanoparticles and trace level pesticides leads to the specific covalent and non-covalent interactions, thereby causing a significant color change in the metal nanoparticles via the aggregation of metal nanoparticles induced by pesticides. In this review, the role of ligand chemistry on the surfaces of metal nanoparticles (Au, Ag and Cu) for colorimetric detection of various pesticides is summarized. This review briefly illustrates the aggregation mechanisms involving in the colorimetric detection of pesticides using functionalized metal nanoparticles as colorimetric sensors. Further, this review also summarizes the used ligands on the surfaces of metal nanoparticles (Au, Ag and Cu) for visual readouts of various pesticides at minimal volumes of samples. Finally, we outline the challenges and future perspectives of ligand chemistry on metal nanoparticles for colorimetric assays of pesticides from various samples. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Globally, the ages at pubertal onset for girls and boys have been decreasing during recent decades, partly attributed to excess body fat accumulation. However, a growing body of literature has recognized that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may play an important role in this global trend, but the association has not yet been fully established. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: EDCs can interfere with normal hormone function and metabolism and play a role in pubertal onset. We aimed to systematically identify and evaluate the current evidence on the timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys following prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs. SEARCH METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in the PubMed database through a block search approach using a combination of index MeSH and free text search terms. Publications were considered if they covered biomarkers of prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs (European Commission's list of category 1 EDCs) measured in maternal or child biospecimen and pubertal onset defined by the progression of the following milestones (and assessed in terms of the following measures): menarche (age), thelarche (Tanner staging) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in girls, and genital stage (Tanner staging), testicular volume (ml) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in boys. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 703 references, of which we identified 52 publications fulfilling the eligibility criteria for the qualitative trend synthesis and 23 publications for the meta-analysis. The qualitative trend synthesis provided data on 103 combinations of associations between prenatal or postnatal exposure to EDC compounds groups and puberty outcomes and the meta-analysis enabled 18 summary risk estimates of meta-associations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Statistically significant associations in the qualitative trend synthesis suggested that postnatal exposure to phthalates may be associated with earlier thelarche and later pubarche. However, we did not find consistent evidence in the meta-analysis for associations between timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys and exposures to any of the studied xenobiotic EDCs. We were not able to identify specific pre- or postnatal windows of exposure as particularly critical and susceptible for effects of EDCs. Current evidence is subject to several methodological challenges and inconsistencies and evidence on specific exposure-outcome associations remains too scarce to firmly confirm EDC exposure as a risk factor for changes in age of pubertal onset in the general child population. To create a more uniform foundation for future comparison of evidence and to strengthen pooled studies, we recommend the use of more standardized approaches in the choice of statistical analyses, with exposure transformations, and in the definitions and assessments of puberty outcomes. The impact of mixtures of EDC exposures on the association also remains unestablished and would be valuable to elucidate for prenatal and postnatal windows of exposure. Future large, longitudinal epidemiological studies are needed to clarify the overall association.  © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {The reaction of 1,10-phenanthroline (Phen) and 4′,4′''-(perfluoropropane-2,2-diyl) bis(([1,1′-biphenyl]-4-carboxylic acid)) (H2L2) with Cu(CH3COO)2⋅H2O in DMF/H2O at 50 ∼ 90°C in capped glass vials afforded three products with distinctively different colours and shapes. Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the three products, namely {[Cu(phen)(L2)] ⋅ 1.25H2O} (1) (teal acicula, KPI = 60.6%), {[Cu(phen)(L2)]⋅ H2O⋅DMF}n(2) (sapphire blue plate, KPI = 65.6%) and {[Cu(phen)(L2)]⋅0.31H2O}n (3) (cool grey plate, KPI = 66.8%) are 1-D supramolecular Cu(II) coordination polymers. Both 1 and 2 are composed of 1-D zigzag chains with 1 contains heterochiral Cu(II) (Λ- and Δ- alternatively) centres in the same chain and 2 contains homochiral Cu(II) (Λ- or Δ-) centres in the same chain, while 3, containing homochiral Cu(II) (Λ- or Δ-) centres, has a helical structure along a axis, with a rectangular channel of a size 19.61 × 16.61 Å2. Each helical turn spans 10.74 Å, composed of two [Cu(L2)(Phen)] units. With the largest KPI (∼66.3%), the highest thermal stability, highest formation energy from DFT calculations and lowest hygroscopicity, 3 can be obtained as the only product at higher temperature (95°C) and/or higher ratio of water (DMF/water (v/v) = 20:6), which implies that it is the thermodynamic product. 2 can be obtained at mediate temperature (60 ∼ 80°C) as the only product or co-exist with other products, while 1 only appeared at low temperature (60 and 70 °C) in the solvents of DMF/water (v/v) = 20:2 or 20:3 at a very small amount. The chromotropism of the three isomers was examined using UV-Vis spectroscopic technique, and the coordination geometry of Cu(II) was examined with Hathaway's tetragonality analysis and Continuous Shape Measures Calculation using SHAPE 2.1 programme. Linear correlations between the solid-state UV-Vis absorption maxima of the three isomers against the tetragonality (T) or the distortion percentage of the coordination geometry of Cu(II) from a perfect octahedral (Doct) were observed. The three complexes were also analyzed by FT IR, TGA and DFT formation energy calculations. The thermodynamic stability and the thermal stability of the three isomer increases in order of 1 < 2 < 3, supported by the analysis of the metal-ligand coordination bonds and the intermolecular interactions, the study of chromotropism and crystal fields, the effects of solvent polarity and temperature to the formation of isomers, the close-packing theory (KPI calculations), the DFT calculations and the TGA analysis. © 2022},

	abstract = {Background: PFAS (per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances) are a large class of synthetic chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial processes. The scientific literature on PFAS has increased dramatically in the last decade. Many stakeholders, including regulators, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and concerned individuals could benefit from an efficient way to access the health and toxicological literature related to PFAS. Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of the available peer-reviewed health or toxicological research for 29 PFAS. Methods: A protocol for conducting this systematic evidence map was initially published on Zenodo (Pelch et al. 2019c), then peer reviewed and published in Environment International (Pelch et al. 2019d). PubMed database was searched through January 25, 2021. Studies were screened for inclusion and exclusion according to the Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad and included any human, animal, and/or in vitro study that investigated exposure to one of the 29 PFAS of interest and a human health or toxicological effect. Selected study details were extracted from included studies as described in the protocol. Study appraisal was not conducted. The included studies and extracted meta-data are freely available in the online, interactive systematic evidence map at https://pfastoxdatabase.org. Results: Over 15,000 studies were retrieved from the PubMed literature searches. After manual screening, 1,067 studies were identified and included as investigating the health or toxicological effect of one or more PFAS of interest. There were 505 human, 385 animal, and 220 in vitro studies. Summary tables of the extracted data and overall observations are included in this report. Conclusions: The PFAS-Tox Database is a useful tool for searching, filtering, and identifying peer reviewed research on the health and toxicological effects of the included PFAS. In this summary of the evidence map we provide examples of data gaps and clusters revealed by the database, with the goal of helping direct future research efforts, facilitate systematic reviews (e.g. on immune effects, mixtures of PFAS, or effects of short chain PFAS), inform regulatory risk assessments, and improve opportunities for cross-disciplinary coordination. We also discuss how this tool supports scientists, regulatory agencies, and other individuals by increasing awareness and access to current evidence regarding the health effects associated with PFAS exposure. © 2022},

	abstract = {Nafion byproduct 2 (H-PFMO2OSA) has been detected in the environment, but little is known about its toxicities. To compare the hepatotoxicity of H-PFMO2OSA with legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), male adult mice were exposed to 0.2, 1, or 5 mg/kg/d of each chemical for 28 days. Results showed that, although H-PFMO2OSA liver and serum concentrations were lower than those of PFOS, the relative liver weight in the H-PFMO2OSA groups was significantly higher than that in the corresponding PFOS groups. In addition, the increase in alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase activity was greater in the H-PFMO2OSA groups than in the PFOS groups. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione reductase activity in the liver increased in the 1 and 5 mg/kg/d H-PFMO2OSA groups and in the 5 mg/kg/d PFOS group. Liver quantitative proteome analysis demonstrated that, similar to PFOS, H-PFMO2OSA caused lipid metabolism disorder, and most lipid metabolism-related differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Additionally, KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted changes in the GSH metabolism pathway after PFOS and H-PFMO2OSA exposure. Then, there were eight DEPs involved in the GSH metabolism pathway that mostly were upregulated after exposure to H-PFMO2OSA but not after exposure to PFOS. In conclusion, H-PFMO2OSA induced higher levels of liver damage and more serious GSH metabolism dysregulation compared to PFOS. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Oxybenzone is an emerging aquatic pollutant whose widespread use has contributed to its detection in the surface waters and body-burdens of exposed biota. In this study, the sub-lethal toxicity effects of oxybenzone were studied at the environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.6 and 5.2 µg/L (including 0.01% DMSO as the solvent control). An integrative in vivo and in silico experimental approach was taken to study the effects of exposure on the metabolic physiology of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) after 7 days of exposure (from 2 to 9 days post fertilization). The use of whole-organism respirometry showed a statistically significant ∼2x increase in metabolic rate for the 0.6 µg/L treatment group, with no significant differences between the solvent control versus 5.2 µg/L oxybenzone treatment level. The analysis of whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing data showed functional categories related to metabolism (metabolic enzymes) and biological regulation (genome regulation, cell signaling) to be highly dysregulated. The transcriptomics changes for metabolic enzyme genes were used to parameterize in silico stoichiometric metabolic models for each treatment group. Flux balance analysis (FBA) simulations for each metabolic model revealed glycerolipid metabolism to be highly affected under the low dose oxybenzone exposure. The further analysis of core metabolic pathways revealed elevated flux through the esterification reactions of glycerolipid metabolism, producing triglycerides. The elevated in vivo metabolic rate observed for 0.6 µg/L oxybenzone is explainable by the elevated catalytic activities of the esterification reactions. Furthermore, the disruption of glycerolipid metabolism predicted by our in silico analysis agrees with the results of non-targeted metabolomics studies performed by other authors, and which demonstrate oxybenzone exposure to cause dyslipidemia and affect glycerophospholipid metabolism. Therefore, the methods of our study provide a framework for integrated biological pathways-based toxicological analysis. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {In the matrix of bacteria/mitochondria/chloroplasts, Lon acts as the degradation machine for soluble proteins. In stress periods, however, proteostasis and survival depend on the strongly conserved Clp/Hsp100 family. Currently, the targets of ATP-powered unfoldases/disaggregases ClpB and ClpX and of peptidase ClpP heptameric rings are still unclear. Trapping experiments and proteome profiling in multiple organisms triggered confusion, so we analyzed the consistency of ClpP-trap targets in bacteria. We also provide meta-analyses of protein interactions in humans, to elucidate where Clp family members are enriched. Furthermore, meta-analyses of mouse complexomics are provided. Genotype–phenotype correlations confirmed our concept. Trapping, proteome, and complexome data retrieved consistent coaccumulation of CLPXP with GFM1 and TUFM orthologs. CLPX shows broad interaction selectivity encompassing mitochondrial translation elongation, RNA granules, and nucleoids. CLPB preferentially attaches to mitochondrial RNA granules and translation initiation components; CLPP is enriched with them all and associates with release/recycling factors. Mutations in CLPP cause Perrault syndrome, with phenotypes similar to defects in mtDNA/mtRNA. Thus, we propose that CLPB and CLPXP are crucial to counteract misfolded insoluble protein assemblies that contain nucleotides. This insight is relevant to improve ClpP-modulating drugs that block bacterial growth and for the treatment of human infertility, deafness, and neurodegeneration. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent environmental pollutant that has become a significant concern around the world. Exposure to PFOS may alter gut microbiota and liver metabolic homeostasis in mammals, thereby increasing the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Diets high in soluble fibers can ameliorate metabolic disease risks. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the hypothesis that soluble fibers (inulin or pectin) could modulate the adverse metabolic effects of PFOS by affecting microbe-liver metabolism and interactions. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed an isocaloric diet containing different fibers: a) inulin (soluble), b) pectin (soluble), or c) cellulose (control, insoluble). The mice were exposed to PFOS in drinking water (3 lg=g per day) for 7 wk. Multi-omics was used to analyze mouse liver and cecum contents. RESULTS: In PFOS-exposed mice, the number of differentially expressed genes associated with atherogenesis and hepatic hyperlipidemia were lower in those that were fed soluble fiber than those fed insoluble fiber. Shotgun metagenomics showed that inulin and pectin protected against differences in microbiome community in PFOS-exposed vs. control mice. It was found that the plasma PFOS levels were lower in inulin-fed mice, and there was a trend of lower liver accumulation of PFOS in soluble fiber-fed mice compared with the control group. Soluble fiber intake ameliorated the effects of PFOS on host hepatic metabolism gene expression and cecal content microbiome structure. DISCUSSIONS: Results from metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic studies suggest that inulin-and pectin-fed mice were less susceptible to PFOS-induced liver metabolic disturbance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and transcriptional changes compared with control diet-fed mice. Our study advances the understanding of interaction between microbes and host under the influences of environmental pollutants and nutrients. The results provide new insights into the microbe-liver metabolic network and the protection against environmental pollutant-induced metabolic diseases by high-fiber diets. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11360. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

	abstract = {Introduction: Autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes (T1D) are believed to be caused by the interplay between several genetic and environmental factors. Elucidation of the role of environmental factors in metabolic and immune dysfunction leading to autoimmune disease is not yet well characterized. Objectives: Here we investigated the impact of exposure to a mixture of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on the metabolome in non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice, an experimental model of T1D. The mixture contained organochlorides, organobromides, and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Methods: Analysis of molecular lipids (lipidomics) and bile acids in serum samples was performed by UPLC-Q-TOF/MS, while polar metabolites were analyzed by GC-Q-TOF/MS. Results: Experimental exposure to the POP mixture in these mice led to several metabolic changes, which were similar to those previously reported as associated with PFAS exposure, as well as risk of T1D in human studies. This included an increase in the levels of sugar derivatives, triacylglycerols and lithocholic acid, and a decrease in long chain fatty acids and several lipid classes, including phosphatidylcholines, lysophosphatidylcholines and sphingomyelins. Conclusion: Taken together, our study demonstrates that exposure to POPs results in an altered metabolic signature previously associated with autoimmunity. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Introduction: In recent years, LC-MS has become the golden standard for metabolomic studies. Indeed, LC is relatively easy to couple with the soft electrospray ionization. As a consequence, many tools have been developed for the structural annotation of tandem mass spectra. However, it is sometimes difficult to do data-dependent acquisition (DDA), especially when developing new methods that stray from the classical LC-MS workflow. Objective: An old tool from petroleomics that has recently gained popularity in metabolomics, the Van Krevelen diagram, is adapted for an overview of the molecular diversity profile in lichens through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Methods: A new method is benchmarked against the state-of-the-art classification tool ClassyFire using a database containing most known lichen metabolites (n ≈ 2,000). Four lichens known for their contrasted chemical composition were selected, and extractions with apolar, aprotic polar, and protic polar solvents were performed to cover a wide range of polarities. Extracts were analyzed with direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DI-ESI-MS) and atmospheric solids analysis probe mass spectrometry (ASAP-MS) techniques to be compared with the chemical composition described in the literature. Results: The most common lichen metabolites were efficiently classified, with more than 90% of the molecules in some classes being matched with ClassyFire. Results from this method are consistent with the various extraction protocols in the present case study. Conclusion: This approach is a rapid and efficient tool to gain structural insight regarding lichen metabolites analyzed by HRMS without relying on DDA by LC-MS/MS analysis. It may notably be of use during the development phase of novel MS-based metabolomic approaches. © 2022 The Authors. Phytochemical Analysis published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.},

	abstract = {Waste generation is becoming increasingly prominent in the environmental arena due to the increase in population and living standards of life. Dioxin and Dioxin-related compounds are a set of hazardous chemicals that are ubiquitously distributed. Polychlorinated dioxins are introduced into our surroundings by both spontaneous and induced activities like combustion, incineration of waste, recycling of e-waste, and paper and pesticide manufacturing. They are chloroaromatic compounds that are found to be lethal and possess carcinogenic properties and are one of the primary examples of persistent environmental pollutants (POP). Removal of these compounds from the environment is very challenging due to their recalcitrant nature. An alternative technique is the use of microbial technology which includes the use of bacteria and fungi to detoxify the dioxins that are considered to be a more effective, economical, and environmentally sustainable alternative. Different microbial interactions were studied for their degradation potential. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and furans (PCDD/F) are found to be degraded by bacteria by adopting either aerobic or anaerobic pathways and the details regarding the diversity, distribution, bioremediation potential, metabolic pathway have been analyzed. This review provides an overview of the source of contamination, its potential toxicity assessment, and various bioremediation techniques that are employed are discussed in detail. It also highlights the nanoremediation technique - a promising tool in which nanoparticles are used in the treatment of toxic organic pollutants. © 2022 Technoscience Publications.

	abstract = {Despite growing interest in edible seaweeds, there is limited information on seaweed chemical contaminant levels in the Salish Sea. Without this knowledge, health-based consumption advisories can not be determined for consumers that include Tribes and First Nations, Asian and Pacific Islander community members, and recreational harvesters. We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo[a]pyrene [BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered. Additionally, although we focused on toxicological aspects, there are cultural and health benefits of seaweed use that may affect consumer choice. © 2022 Hahn et al.

	abstract = {Objective: The present systematic review aimed to verify the association between Gestational Diabetes Mellitus (GDM) and Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) in children. Design A systematic search was conducted in four databases and the grey literature. The risk of bias of the studies was analyzed with the aid of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A quantitative synthesis was performed through meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each result using the Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: Thirteen studies (seven cross-sectional, two cohort and four case-control studies) were included in the qualitative analysis and eleven were included in the meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were conducted considering general DDE (regardless of the type of defect), hypoplasia, molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) and hypomineralized primary second molars (HPSM). Subgroups based on the type of dentition were also analyzed. Children of mothers who had GDM presented a greater likelihood of general DDE (OR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.66–4.44), MIH (OR = 3.14; 95% CI: 1.20–8.25) and hypoplasia (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.36–3.46). No association was found between HPSM and GDM (OR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.17–2.20). An association was found between GDM and DDE in the permanent dentition. Therefore, children whose mothers had GDM were more likely to present DDE compared to those whose mothers did not have this metabolic disorder. Conclusions: The results should be interpreted with caution due to the low evidence of the primary studies. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {In this study, we investigated whether the levels of heavy metal and pesticide residues in herbal decoctions in Korea in 2019 were within normal limits. In total, 30 decoctions composed of multi-ingredient traditional herbs were sampled from traditional Korean medicine (TKM) clinics, TKM hospitals, and external herbal dispensaries in 2019. The decoctions were analyzed for heavy metal content such as lead, arsenic, and cadmium using inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry. For mercury, an automatic mercury analyzer based on the gold amalgamation process was used. For pesticide residues, gas chromatography with electron capture detection and gas chromatography with mass selective detection were used for the analyses. Based on the testing, heavy metals were identified in most of the decoctions (Cd: 0.000–0.003 ppm, Pb: 0.003–0.023 ppm, As: 0.000−0.016 ppm, Hg: 0.000–0.002 ppm). Pesticide residues (e.g., total DDT, total BHC, aldrin, endrin, dieldrin) were not detected at all. All of these were no more than the limit values in preceding studies. Therefore, this study confirms that the contents of heavy metals and pesticides in herbal decoctions are within safe levels based on a previous study and provides evidence for establishing safety management standards for herbal decoctions in Korea. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a large class of chemicals with widespread use and persistence in the environment and in humans; however, most of the epidemiology research has focused on a small subset. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were con-sidered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for “legacy” PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SEM highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are a class of persistent pollutants with adverse biological effects and pose a serious threat to ecological environments and human health. The previously isolated phenanthrene-degrading bacterial consortium (PDMC) consists of the genera Sphingobium and Pseudomonas and can degrade a wide range of PAHs. To identify the degradation mechanism of PAHs in the consortium PDMC, metagenomic binning was conducted and a Sphingomonadales assembly genome with 100% completeness was obtained. Additionally, Sphingobium sp. SHPJ-2, an efficient degrader of PAHs, was successfully isolated from the consortium PDMC. Strain SHPJ-2 has powerful degrading abilities and various degradation pathways of high-molecular-weight PAHs, including fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, and chrysene. Two ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases, five cytochrome P450s, and a pair of electron transfer chains associated with PAH degradation in strain SHPJ-2, which share 83.0%–99.0% similarity with their corresponding homologous proteins, were identified by a combination of Sphingomonadales assembly genome annotation, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and heterologous expression. Furthermore, when coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with the appropriate electron transfer chain, PhnA1B1 could effectively degrade chrysene and benzo[a]anthracene, while PhnA2B2 degrade fluoranthene. Altogether, these results provide a comprehensive assessment of strain SHPJ-2 and contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for the PAH degradation. © 2022 The Authors. mLife published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. on behalf of Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.},

	abstract = {Electronic waste management is a global rising concern that is primarily being handled by informal recycling practices. These release a mix of potentially hazardous chemicals, which is an important public health concern. These chemicals include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), used as flame retardants in electronic parts, which are persistent in nature and show bioaccumulative characteristics. Although PBDEs are suspected endocrine disruptors, particularly targeting thyroid and reproductive hormone functions, the relationship of PBDEs with these health effects are not well established. We used the Navigation Guide methodology to conduct a systematic review of studies in populations exposed to e-waste to better understand the relationships of these persistent flame retardants with hormonal and reproductive health. We assessed nineteen studies that fit our pre-determined inclusion criteria for risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and other criteria that helped rate the overall evidence for its quality and strength of evidence. The studies suggest PBDEs may have an adverse effect on thyroid hormones, reproductive hormones, semen quality, and neonatal health.

	abstract = {Study design: Systematic review and meta-analysis. Objectives: Cervical spine endoscopic discectomy and decompression have gained popularity in the last decade. This review aimed to shed light on the current outcomes of cervical spine endoscopic procedures for degenerative disc disease (DDD) and to calculate a pooled estimate of various outcome measures. Methods: We retrieved articles published in English related to endoscopic cervical spine procedures from 3 central databases from inception until September 2020. A subgroup analysis based on the anterior versus the posterior approach was performed. Results: Thirty-one articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria and included 1,410 patients. A successful outcome was observed in 91.3% (88.6-93.4%, P = 0.000). This percentage was lower for the anterior approach (89.6% [85.8-92.5%], P = 0.000) than for the posterior approach (94.2% [90.4-96.5%], P = 0.000). A higher percentage of poor outcomes was reported for the anterior approach (5.7% [3.2-10.1%], P = 0.000 vs. 2.3% [1-5.5%], P = 0.000 for the posterior approach). The overall complication rate was 7.2% (5.2-9.8%, P = 0.000). There was a slightly higher complication rate for the anterior approach (7.9% [4.5-13.3%], P = 0.000) than for the posterior approach (6.7% [4.4-10%], P = 0.000). The revision rate was 4.2% (2.6-6.8%, P = 0.000); and 4.2% (1.8-9.7%, P = 0.000) for the anterior approach and 4.00% (2.2-7.4%, P = 0.000) for the posterior approach. Conclusions: There is a higher success rate and lower complication rate with the posterior approach than with the anterior approach. However, high-quality randomized controlled trials are vital to evaluate the efficacy of these procedures. © The Author(s) 2021.},

However, the microbial response mechanism under chronic effects of BACs on acidogenesis and methanogenesis in anaerobic digestion (AD) has not been clearly disclosed. This study investigated the AD (by-)products and microbial evolution under low to high BACs concentrations from bioreactor startup to steady running. It was found that BACs can lead to an increase of WAS hydrolysis and fermentation, but a disturbance to acidogenic bacteria also occurred at low BACs concentration. A noticeable inhibition to methanogenesis occurred when BAC concentration was up to 15 mg/g TSS. Metagenomic analysis revealed the key genes involved in acetic acid (HAc) biosynthesis (i.e. phosphate acetyltransferase, PTA), β-oxidation pathway (acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase) and propionic acid (HPr) conversion was slightly promoted compared with control. Furthermore, BACs inhibited the acetotrophic methanogenesis (i.e. acetyl-CoA synthetase), especially BAC concentration was up to 15 mg/g TSS, thereby enhanced short chain fatty acids (SCFAs) accumulation. Overall, chronic stimulation of functional microorganisms with increasing concentrations of BACs impact WAS fermentation. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effects of physiotherapeutic interventions on biomarkers of neuropathic pain in preclinical models of peripheral neuropathic pain (PNP). The search was performed in Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane, Cinhal, Psycinfo, Scopus, Medline, and Science Direct. Studies evaluating any type of physiotherapy intervention for PNP (systemic or traumatic) were included. Eighty-one articles were included in this review. The most common PNP model was chronic constriction injury, and the most frequently studied biomarkers were related to neuro-immune processes. Exercise therapy and Electro-acupuncture were the 2 most frequently studied physiotherapy interventions while acupuncture and joint mobilization were less frequently examined. Most physiotherapeutic interventions modulated the expression of biomarkers related to neuropathic pain. Whereas the results seem promising; they have to be considered with caution due to the high risk of bias of included studies and high heterogeneity of the type and anatomical localization of biomarkers reported. The review protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019142878). Perspective: This article presents the current evidence about physiotherapeutic interventions on biomarkers of neuropathic pain in preclinical models of peripheral neuropathic pain. Existing findings are reviewed, and relevant data are provided on the effectiveness of each physiotherapeutic modality, as well as its certainty of evidence and clinical applicability. © 2022 The Authors},

This systematic review aimed to analyze autopsies related to suicides by consuming poison, focusing on the correlation between substance use and the country of origin to create an alarm bell to indicate that suicide maybe attempted and prevent it. The systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, with the primary objective of identifying autopsies conducted in cases of suicide by consuming poison in specific geographic areas. Significant differences in substances were observed between low-income and Western countries that confirm previous literature data. In rural areas and Asian countries, most suicides by consuming poison involve the use of pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates. In Western countries, illicit drugs and medically prescribed drugs are the leading cause of suicide by self-poisoning. Future research should shed light on the correlation between social, medical, and demographic characteristics and the autopsy findings in suicides by self-poisoning to highlight the risk factors and implement tailored prevention programs worldwide. Performing a complete autopsy on a suspected suicide by self-poisoning could be essential in supporting worldwide public health measures and policy makers. Therefore, complete autopsies in such cases must be vigorously promoted. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) has been associated with kidney cancer in human studies. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of two large studies of PFOA and renal cell carcinoma (RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer); one from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (324 cases and controls), and a second from the C8 Science Panel (103 cases and 511 controls). Serum PFOA levels were estimated a median of 8 years before diagnosis. Analyses were conducted via conditional logistic regression. Lifetime risk of kidney cancer per unit serum PFOA concentration and per unit dose were calculated. Results: The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of serum PFOA levels were 4.8, 7.3, and 23.9 ng/ml for the pooled analysis. The preferred model for the pooled data was a two-piece linear spline model (knot at 12.5 ng/ml serum PFOA); the log odds of RCC increased 0.1349 per 1 ng/ml increase in serum PFOA up to the knot (eg, an OR of 2.02 (1.45–2.80) from the median to the knot), and was flat thereafter. The estimated lifetime excess risk (cancer slope factor) with an exposure of 1 ng/ml was 0.0018, similar to the excess risk of 0.0026 recently reported by CalEPA based on different methods. Assuming a serum half-life of 2.3 years and a distribution volume of 170 ml/kg for PFOA, our results are equivalent to 0.0128 per ng/kg/d of PFOA intake. To limit excess lifetime kidney cancer risk to 1/1,000,000, our data suggest a limit of 0.0015 ng/L (0.0015 ppt) for PFOA in drinking water, similar to CalEPA's proposed Public Health Goal and the new US EPA Drinking Water Health Advisory. Conclusions: Our results correspond reasonably well with cancer slope factors developed by other investigators using published summary data, and suggest drinking water limits similar to new recommendations by the US EPA. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Introduction: Work-related exposures to harmful agents or factors are associated with an increase in incidence of occupational diseases. These exposures often represent a complex mixture of different stressors, challenging the ability to delineate the mechanisms and risk factors underlying exposure-disease relationships. The use of omics measurement approaches that enable characterization of biological marker patterns provide internal indicators of molecular alterations, which could be used to identify bioeffects following exposure to a toxicant. Metabolomics is the comprehensive analysis of small molecule present in biological samples, and allows identification of potential modes of action and altered pathways by systematic measurement of metabolites. Objectives: The aim of this study is to review the application of metabolomics studies for use in occupational health, with a focus on applying metabolomics for exposure monitoring and its relationship to occupational diseases. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published up to 2021. Results: Most of reviewed studies included worker populations exposed to heavy metals such as As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn and organic compounds such as tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, trichloroethylene, polyfluoroalkyl, acrylamide, polyvinyl chloride. Occupational exposures were associated with changes in metabolites and pathways, and provided novel insight into the relationship between exposure and disease outcomes. The reviewed studies demonstrate that metabolomics provides a powerful ability to identify metabolic phenotypes and bioeffect of occupational exposures. Conclusion: Continued application to worker populations has the potential to enable characterization of thousands of chemical signals in biological samples, which could lead to discovery of new biomarkers of exposure for chemicals, identify possible toxicological mechanisms, and improved understanding of biological effects increasing disease risk associated with occupational exposure. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Climate change is affecting Antarctica and the Southern Ocean and effects have been already reported for the abiotic compartments of the ecosystems, e.g. ice loss and iceberg calving. Global warming can alter also the distribution of persistent organic pollutant (POPs) both at a global scale and in the Antarctic Region, due to their physical-chemical characteristics. Effects of climate changes have been already reported on feeding behaviour and reproductive process of organisms. Another consequence for organisms includes the POP bioaccumulation. Here we review the literature reporting the linkage between recorded effects of climate changes and POP bioaccumulation in resident marine Antarctic species (fish and penguins). Notwithstanding Antarctica is a final sink for persistent contaminants due to the extreme cold climate, a general decreasing POP trend has been observed for some POPs. Their concentrations in biota are reported to be linked to ice melting and large iceberg calving; the peculiar marine Antarctic ecosystems and the pelagic-benthic coupling may also contribute to alterations in the bioaccumulation processes. These effects are similar in polar regions, although the comparison with the Arctic biota is not possible due to the lack of data in the Antarctic Region. It remains an open question if the POP amount accumulated in the Antarctic ecosystems is decreasing or not. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Plastic are emerging pollutants requiring urgent intervention for its management. In African countries like Nigeria, the evidence to inform plastic pollution management is scanty. This rapid review aimed to systematically evaluate evidence on the distribution, sources, biological effects, research gaps and policy needs of plastic pollution in various environmental matrices in Nigeria. Peer-reviewed journal articles on nano-, micro-, meso- and macroplastics contamination of water, sediment, air, soil and biota were accessed from PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct. They were screened, comprehensively revised and critically appraised for inclusion, data extraction and evidence synthesis. A total of 358,974 articles were accessed from any publication date up till May 30, 2021. Only 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and critical appraisal. Only 26 of the included studies reported the distribution, levels and/or effects of microplastics (MPs) (n = 12), macroplastics (n = 12) or both (n = 2) in water, sediment, biota, food and/or land. Only 15 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory had any data on micro- and/or macroplastics. Macroplastics from land-based sources were mainly reported from educational institutions, residential areas and markets. Plastic sources reported were tire wear, cigarette butts, fishing ropes and gears, plastic bags, water sachets and e-wastes. Biological effects (oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reduced plant root biomass) of virgin MPs were reported in crab, African catfish and lime tree only in laboratory experiments. Microplastic data in biota were limited to selected fish species, aquatic insects and gastropods. Only one (1) study on plastics in waterbodies in Northern Nigeria (Kogi State) was found. Research gaps on plastic distribution in terrestrial biota, other aquatic biota, soil, air, ground and potable water sources as well as biological effects were identified. Policy needs for plastic pollution management identified include stakeholder education, polymer replacement, recycling, tax and incentives to support the sustainability of life below water and on land (UN SDGs 14 and 15). © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The emerging demand for the enhancement of biodegradation of persistent organic pollutants from marine oil spills using oil-treating agents to minimize the environmental impacts promotes the development of green dispersants. Shrimp waste is a potential raw material to generate green dispersants. The biodegradability of dispersed oil and dispersants themselves are key factors for the national consideration of the approval, stockpile, and usage of dispersants. However, it is unknown whether shrimp-waste-based dispersant (SWD) has high bioavailability or facilitates the biodegradation of dispersed oil. In this study, we tackled the biodegradation of oil dispersed by a purified SWD. Furthermore, the SWD biodegradability was evaluated by exploring the degradation genes via metagenomic sequencing, analyzing the enzymatic activities for dispersant biodegradation by molecular docking, and discussing the SWD toxicity. We discovered that the SWD facilitated the biodegradation of two crude oils (Alaska North Slope and Marine Fuel-No.6). The metagenomic analysis with molecular docking showed that fresh seawater had feasible enzymes to degrade the SWD to safety components. Additionally, the SWD was low toxic and high bioactive. The findings helped confirm that the purified SWD is an effective and eco-sustainable marine oil spill treating agent and tracked the biodegradation of dispersed oil and the SWD. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) has had an incomparable triumph in prenatal diagnostics in the last decade. Over 1400 research articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of this test. Methods: The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects—mainly from a patient-perspective. Results: A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? Conclusions: Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), pesticides are widely used in agricultural and residential settings. Little is known about how pesticides affect child growth. Objectives: To systematically review and synthesise the evidence on the associations between pesticide exposure and adverse birth outcomes and/or impaired postnatal growth in children up to 5 years of age in LMICs. Methods: We searched 10 databases from inception through November 2021. We included cohort and cross-sectional studies investigating associations between self-reported or measured prenatal or postnatal pesticide exposure and child growth (postnatal child linear/ponderal growth, and/or birth outcomes). Two researchers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed certainty using GRADE. The protocol was preregistered with PROSPERO (CRD42021292919). Results: Of 939 records retrieved, 31 studies met inclusion criteria (11 cohort, 20 cross-sectional). All studies assessed prenatal exposure. Twenty-four studies reported on birth weight. Four found positive associations with organochlorines (0.01–0.25 standardised mean difference (SMD)) and two found negative associations (−0.009 SMD to −55 g). Negative associations with organophosphates (−170 g, n = 1) and pyrethroids (−97 to −233 g, n = 2) were also documented. Two (out of 15) studies reporting on birth length found positive associations with organochlorines (0.21–0.25 SMD) and one found negative associations (−0.25 to −0.32 SMD). Organophosphate exposure was negatively associated with birth length (−0.37 cm, n = 1). Organophosphate exposure was also associated with higher risk/prevalence of low birth weight (2 out of nine studies) and preterm birth (2 out of six studies). Certainty of the evidence was “very low” for all outcomes. Conclusion: The limited literature from LMICs shows inconclusive associations between prenatal pesticide exposure, child growth, and birth outcomes. Studies with accurate quantitative data on exposure to commonly used pesticides in LMICs using consistent methodologies in comparable populations are needed to better understand how pesticides influence child growth. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {The potential adverse effects of UV-filter pollution in marine environments have been the focus of research in recent years. This systematic review aims to determine the extent of this emerging problem, both quantitatively and qualitatively, combining temporal and science mapping analyses to explore the development of the field of UV-filters in the marine environment (from 1990 to 2021), and to outline new research frontiers. The temporal trend analysis revealed an exponential growth of published studies over the last decade (70% since 2016), confirming the emerging role of this topic in environmental science. The meta-analysis determined that 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) are top-priority environmental pollutants due to their increasing usage and, in turn, a frequent occurrence in marine ecosystems. This meta-analysis determined the focus on these two contaminants for this review. A critical discussion of the applications, regulatory aspects, and environmental occurrences of these selected compounds was provided. The present study also focused on the most recent (2015–2021) field and laboratory studies investigating the ecotoxicological impacts of 4-MBC and BP-3 on marine invertebrates. This review highlights the need for more research efforts to fill the knowledge gaps on the realistic effects these compounds may have when considered individually, in combination, or as subsequent exposures. Overall, this review aims to establish guidelines for further studies to understand the effect of UV-filters on marine ecosystems and marine invertebrate communities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

PFAS are stable and extremely resistant to degradation, resulting in high persistence throughout the environment as well as in human blood. PFAS consist of a large family of synthetic chemicals, with over 4000 distinct varieties having been identified and around 250 currently being manufactured at globally relevant levels. Numerous epidemiological studies have linked exposure to PFAS with adverse health effects ranging from immunotoxicity, cardiometabolic disease, developmental and reproductive effects, cancer, and recently type 2 diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated associations between serum PFAS concentrations and glycemic indicators of type 2 diabetes including glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR in adolescent and adult cohorts. In addition, some studies have shown positive associations with incident type 2 diabetes and multiple PFAS. However, the link between PFAS exposure and the development of diabetes continues to be a disputed area of study, with conflicting data having been reported from various epidemiological studies. In this mini review we will summarize the current state of the literature linking PFAS to type 2 diabetes and discuss important future directions including the use of more complex mixtures-based statistical analyses.

	abstract = {Acquired platelet function disorders (PFD) are rare bleeding diseases that should be suspected in all patients with unexplained mucocutaneous bleedings of recent onset, with no previous history of haemorrhages, and with normal coagulation test and platelet count. Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrombasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet αIIbβ3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (aδSPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatmentoftheunderlyingdiseaseinsecondaryforms,andimmunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies. Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and aδSPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed. Although no guidelines are available for the management of these very rare conditions, presentation of all cases reported so far can help clinicians in the diagnosis and treatment of these life-threatening diseases. © 2022 Edizioni SIMTI.

	abstract = {Basin land-use interacts with hydrology to deliver chemical contaminants to riverine environments. These chemicals are eventually taken up by aquatic organisms, where they can cause harmful effects. However, knowledge gaps related to the connections between hydrological, chemical, and biological processes currently limit our ability to forecast potential future changes in contaminant concentrations accurately. In this study, concentrations of three pesticide classes (organochlorines, organophosphates, and herbicides) and a standard suite of trace metals were analyzed in the South Saskatchewan River, Canada in 2020 and 2021 in water, sediments, and fishes. Organochlorine pesticides have been banned in Canada since the 1970s, yet there were some detections for methoxychlor and lindane, predominantly in sediment and fish samples, which could be attributed to legacy contamination. Except for malathion and parathion, organophosphate pesticides were scarcely detected in both sampling years in all matrices, and neonicotinoids were below detection in all samples. Conversely, the herbicides 2,4-D and dicamba were detected consistently throughout all locations in water samples for both sampling years. Overall, concentrations were 3 times higher in 2020 when river discharge was ∼2 times higher, suggesting run-off from the surrounding catchment or disturbance of contaminated sediments. Analysis for trace metals revealed that Cu and Zn exceeded sediment quality guidelines in some locations. Mercury concentrations exceeded the guidelines for about 18% of the samples (water and sediment) analyzed. These findings fill gaps in monitoring datasets and highlight key links between hydrology and chemistry that can be further explored in computational models to predict future contaminant trends in freshwater systems. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Introduction and hypothesis: Patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) are helpful instruments when measuring and reporting changes in patient health status (Al Sayah et al. J Patient Rep Outcomes 5 (Suppl 2):99, 2021) such as the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The Australasian Pelvic Floor Procedure Registry (APFPR) aims to increase capacity for women to report surgical outcomes through the collection of HrQoL data (Ruseckaite et al. Qual Life Res. 2021) but currently lacks a pain-specific PROM for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), particularly POP and SUI. This review aims to systematically review the existing literature and identify instruments that measure pain in women with POP and SUI for inclusion within the APFPR, which reports on complications from these conditions. Methods: We conducted a literature search on OVID MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMCARE databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies from inception to April 2021. Full-text studies were included if they used PROMs to measure pain in women with POP and SUI. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Results: From 2001 studies, 23 publications describing 19 different PROMs were included for analysis. Eight of these instruments were specific to the pelvic floor; four were only specific to pain and used across multiple disorders; three were generic quality of life instruments and four were other non-validated instruments such as focus group interviews. These instruments were not specific to pain in women with POP or SUI, as they did not identify all relevant domains such as the sensation, region and duration of pain, or incidents where onset of pain occurs. Conclusions: The findings of this review suggest there are no current PROMs that are suitable pain-specific instruments for women with POP or SUI. This knowledge may inform and assist in the development of a new PROM to be implemented into the APFPR. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {A meta-analysis was conducted of published literature reporting concentrations of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in groundwater for sites distributed in 20 countries across the globe. Data for >35 PFAS were aggregated from 96 reports published from 1999 to 2021. The final data set comprises approximately 21,000 data points after removal of time-series and duplicate samples as well as non-detects. The reported concentrations range over many orders of magnitude, from ng/L to mg/L levels. Distinct differences in concentration ranges are observed between sites located within or near sources versus those that are not. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranging from <0.03 ng/L to ~7 mg/L, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), ranging from 0.01 ng/L to ~5 mg/L, were the two most reported PFAS. The highest PFAS concentration in groundwater is ~15 mg/L reported for the replacement-PFAS 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). Maximum reported groundwater concentrations for PFOA and PFOS were compared to concentrations reported for soils, surface waters, marine waters, and precipitation. Soil concentrations are generally significantly higher than those reported for the other media. This accrues to soil being the primary entry point for PFAS release into the environment for many sites, as well as the generally significantly greater retention capacity of soil compared to the other media. The presence of PFAS has been reported for all media in all regions tested, including areas that are far removed from specific PFAS sources. This gives rise to the existence of a “background” concentration of PFAS that must be accounted for in both regional and site-specific risk assessments. The presence of this background is a reflection of the large-scale use of PFAS, their general recalcitrance, and the action of long-range transport processes that distribute PFAS across regional and global scales. This ubiquitous distribution has the potential to significantly impact the quality and availability of water resources in many regions. In addition, the pervasive presence of PFAS in the environment engenders concerns for impacts to ecosystem and human health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Chlorine dioxide (ClO2) has emerged as a broad-spectrum, safe, and effective disinfectant due to its high oxidation efficiency and reduced formation of organochlorinated by-products during application. This article provides an updated overview of ClO2-based oxidation processes used in water treatment. A systematic review of scientific information and experimental data on ClO2-based water purification procedures is presented. Concerning ClO2-based oxidation derivative problems, the pros and cons of ClO2-based combined processes are assessed and disinfection by-product (DBP) control approaches are proposed. The kinetic and mechanistic data on ClO2 reactivity towards micropollutants are discussed. ClO2 selectively reacts with electron-rich moieties (anilines, phenols, olefins, and amines) and eliminates certain inorganic ions and microorganisms with high efficiency. The formation of chlorite and chlorate during the oxidation process is a crucial concern when utilizing ClO2. Future applications include the combination of ClO2 with ferrous ions, activated carbon, ozone, UV, visible light, or persulfate processes. The combined process can reduce by-product generation while still ensuring ClO2 sterilization and disinfection. Overall, this research could provide useful information and new insights into the application of ClO2-based technologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Awareness of the adverse effects of exposure to pollutant mixtures, possibly much more severe than individual chemicals, has drawn attention towards the necessity of using multi-residue methods to obtain the most possible comprehensive information on exposome. Among the different biological matrices used for exposure assessment, hair enables to detect the largest number of chemicals, including many classes such as persistent pollutants, hydrophilic metabolites and metals. Most biomonitoring studies are however focused on a limited number of pollutants and only give a partial information on exposure. Combining several multi-residue methods, the present study aimed at assessing the exposure of a population to an extensive variety of chemicals by hair analysis. One hair sample was collected from each participant (55 children and 134 adults). Samples were analysed with three different multi-residue methods, targeting, respectively, 152 organic pollutants (pesticides, PCBs, bisphenols, PBDEs), 62 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metabolites, nicotine and cotinine and 36 metals. From 33 to 70 organic chemicals were detected in each child’s hair sample, and from 34 up to 74 in adults. From 7 to 26 PAH were detected per child, and 7 to 21 in adults. Twenty-three to 27 metals were detected per child and 21 to 28 per adult. The highest median concentration were observed for zinc (143 μg /mg in children; 164 μg /mg in adults), bisphenol A (95.9 pg/mg in children; 64.7 pg/mg in adults) and nicotine (66.4 pg/mg in children; 51.9 pg/mg in adults). The present study provides the most comprehensive exposure assessment ever and highlights the simultaneous exposure to multiple classes of pollutants in the general population. The results support the use of multi-residue methods for future studies on exposure-associated effects, to document exposome and better consider the effect of chemical mixtures. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background & Aims: Exposure to poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a class of persistent organic pollutants, is ubiquitous. Animal studies suggest that PFAS may increase risk of fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via impacts on hepatic lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, but human data is lacking. We examined associations between PFAS exposure, altered metabolic pathways, and risk of non-viral HCC. Methods: In this nested case-control study, pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS and metabolomics were measured in 50 incident HCC cases and 50 individually matched controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. Cases/controls were matched by age, sex, race, and study area. PFAS exposure and risk of HCC were examined using conditional logistic regression. A metabolome-wide association study and pathway enrichment analysis was performed for PFAS exposure and HCC risk, and key metabolites/metabolic pathways were identified using a meet in the middle approach. Results: High perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels (90th percentile from NHANES; >55 μg/L) were associated with 4.5-fold increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-16.0). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PFOS exposure was associated with alterations in amino acid and glycan biosynthesis pathways, which were also associated with HCC risk. We identified 4 metabolites linking PFOS exposure with HCC, including glucose, butyric acid (a short-chain fatty acid), α-ketoisovaleric acid (a branched-chain α-keto acid), and 7α-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (a bile acid), each of which was positively associated with PFOS exposure and risk of HCC. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept analysis shows that exposure to high PFOS levels was associated with increased risk of non-viral HCC, likely via alterations in glucose, amino acid, and bile acid metabolism. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Lay summary: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as “forever chemicals” because they are difficult to break down and stay in the human body for years, are extremely common and can cause liver damage. In a first of its kind study, we found that exposure to high levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, one of the most common PFAS chemicals, was linked to increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans. Hepatocellular carcinoma is difficult to treat and is one of the most common forms of liver cancer, and these findings may provide new avenues for helping to prevent this disease. © 2022 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Single-atom site catalysts (SACs) can maximize the utilization of active metal species and provide an attractive way to regulate the activity and selectivity of catalytic reactions. The adjustable coordination configuration and atomic structure of SACs enable them to be an ideal candidate for revealing reaction mechanisms in various catalytic processes. The minimum use of metals and relatively tight anchoring of the metal atoms significantly reduce leaching and environmental risks. Additionally, the unique physicochemical properties of single atom sites endow SACs with superior activity in various catalytic processes for environmental remediation (ER). Generally, SACs are burgeoning and promising materials in the application of ER. However, a systematic and critical review on the mechanism and broad application of SACs-based ER is lacking. Herein, we review emerging studies applying SACs for different ERs, such as eliminating organic pollutants in water, removing volatile organic compounds, purifying automobile exhaust, and others (hydrodefluorination and disinfection). We have summarized the synthesis, characterization, reaction mechanism and structural-function relationship of SACs in ER. In addition, the perspectives and challenges of SACs for ER are also analyzed. We expect that this review can provide constructive inspiration for discoveries and applications of SACs in environmental catalysis in the future. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Even though the common acknowledgment that vacant urban lands (VUL) can play a positive role in improving stormwater management, little synthesized literature is focused on understanding how VUL can take advantage of different stormwater control measures (SCMs) to advance urban water quality. The project aims to provide urban planners with information on the remediation of vacant lands using urban runoff pollutant removal techniques. To find the most effective removal method, relevant scholarly papers and case studies are reviewed to see what types of vacant land have many urban runoff pollutants and how to effectively remove contaminants from stormwater runoff in the city by SCMs. The results show that previously developed/used land (but now vacant) has been identified as contaminated sites, including prior residential, commercial, industrial, and parking lot land use from urban areas. SCMs are effective management approaches to reduce nonpoint source pollution problems runoff. It is an umbrella concept that can be used to capture nature-based, cost-effective, and eco-friendly treatment technologies and redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive, economically viable, and with good public acceptance. Among these removal techniques, a bioretention system tends to be effective for removing dissolved and particulate components of heavy metals and phosphorus. Using different plant species and increasing filter media depth has identified the effectiveness of eliminating nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). A medium with a high hydraulic conductivity covers an existing medium with low hydraulic conductivity, and the result will be a higher and more effective decrease for phosphorus (P) pollutants. In addition, wet ponds were found to be highly effective at removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with removal rates as high as 99%. For the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) pollutants, despite the implementation of SCMs in urban areas to remove PFAAs and particulate-related contaminants in stormwater runoff, the current literature has little information on SCMs’ removal of PFAAs. Studies have also found that VUL’s size, shape, and connectivity are significantly inversely correlated with the reduction in stormwater runoff. This paper will help planners and landscape designers make efficient decisions around removing pollutants from VUL stormwater runoff, leading to better use of these spaces. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Evidence supports the potential influence of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on the pathogenesis and progression of obesity and diabetes. Diet-toxicant interactions appear to be important in diet-induced obesity/diabetes; however, the factors influencing this interaction, especially the early life environmental exposure, are unclear. Herein, we investigated the metabolic effects following early life five-day exposure (24 μg/kg body weight per day) to 3,3′,4,4′,5-pentacholorobiphenyl (PCB 126) at four months after exposure in mice fed with control (CTRL) or high-fat diet (HFD). Activation of aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR) signaling as well as higher levels of liver nucleotides were observed at 4 months after PCB 126 exposure in mice, independent of diet status. Inflammatory responses including higher levels of serum cytokines and adipose inflammatory gene expression caused by early life PCB 126 were observed only in HFD-fed mice in adulthood. Notably, early life PCB 126 exposure worsened HFD-induced impaired glucose homeostasis characterized by glucose intolerance and elevated gluconeogenesis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle flux without worsening the effects of HFD related to adiposity in adulthood. Furthermore, early life PCB 126 exposure resulted in diet-dependent changes in bacterial community structure and function later in life, as indicated by metagenomic and metabolomic analyses. These data contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of the interactions between diet and early life environmental chemical exposure. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: The treatments for trochanteric fractures try to regain early mobility and limit morbidity and risk of reoperations. The most currently used dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the proximal femoral nail (PFN) are both with pros and cons. We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of these interventions for trochanteric fractures by evaluating the surgical performance and postoperative outcomes. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register were searched for RCTs comparing DHS and PFN for trochanteric fractures. All selected studies and the risk of bias were assessed. Clinical data including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, successful closed reduction and complications like nonunion, implant failure and reoperation were recorded. Random-effects models were used in Review Manager software, and GRADE was applied for the interpretation of the evidence. Results: From 286 identified trials, twelve RCTs including 1889 patients were eligible for inclusion; six RCTs directly comparing DHS with PFN, while other six compared DHS with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). Compared to DHS, PFN had shorter operative time and led to less intraoperative blood loss. However, DHS need less intraoperative fluoroscopy time than PFN. No difference was seen for the achievement of closed reduction. For risk of postoperative complications, no difference was seen between PFN and DHS for non-union, risk of implant failure and revision surgery. Conclusions: PFN(A) resulted in a shorter operative time and less intraoperative blood loss compared to DHS. However, no difference was seen for postoperative complications.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography is a diagnostic and therapeutic procedure that involves inserting a needle into the biliary tree, followed by the immediate insertion of a catheter. Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) is a novel technique that allows BD by echoendoscopy and fluoroscopy using a stent from the biliary tree to the gastrointestinal tract. AIM To compare the technical aspects and outcomes of percutaneous transhepatic BD (PTBD) and EUS-BD. METHODS Different databases, including PubMed, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, the Cochrane library, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched according to the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses to obtain studies comparing PTBD and EUS-BD. RESULTS Among the six studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, PTBD patients underwent significantly more reinterventions (4.9 vs 1.3), experienced more postprocedural pain (4.1 vs 1.9), and experienced more late adverse events (53.8% vs 6.6%) than EUS-BD patients. There was a significant reduction in the total bilirubin levels in both the groups (16.4-3.3 μmol/L and 17.2-3.8 μmol/L for EUSBD and PTBD, respectively; P = 0.002) at the 7-d follow-up. There were no significant differences observed in the complication rates between PTBD and EUSBD (3.3 vs 3.8). PTBD was associated with a higher adverse event rate than EUSBD in all the procedures, including reinterventions (80.4% vs 15.7%, respectively) and a higher index procedure (39.2% vs 18.2%, respectively). CONCLUSION The findings of this systematic review revealed that EUS-BD is linked with a higher rate of effective BD and a more manageable procedure-related adverse event profile than PTBD. These findings highlight the evidence for successful EUS-BD implementation.  © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants that degrade slowly in the environment. Humic acid (HA), the main component of soil organic matter, or more specifically, the quinone moieties in HA, is generally regarded as an “electron shuttle” between pollutants and microorganisms, which could promote microbial remediation of contamination. In this study, we examined the dechlorination of PCB153 by adding HA and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS, a model compound of quinones) to systems containing PCB dechlorinators, analyzed the composition and functional gene network of the microbial community by metagenomics, and explored the role of HA by modifying or substituting carbon sources or electron donors. However, this study found that HA accelerated microbial dechlorination of PCBS, while AQDS did not. Moreover, HA without quinone activity still promoted dechlorination, but not without carbon source or electron donor. Metagenomic analysis showed that HA did not promote the growth of PCB dechlorinator (Dehalococcoides), but the transmembrane electron carriers in the HA group were higher than those in the AQDS group and the control group, so HA may have promoted the electron transport process. This study is helpful for microbial remediation of PCB contamination, and provides new insights into the role that HA plays in the biogeochemical cycle. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Objective: To conduct a comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to estimate the relationship between endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), poly-brominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), phthalates (PAEs), and per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) exposure and risk of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). Methods: Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case–control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests. Results: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00-–1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15–1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03–1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02–1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91–1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00–1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02–1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00–1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis. Conclusion: These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.

	abstract = {Milk is a widely consumed food rich in macro- and micronutrients that play an important role in health preservation. While it affects positively human nutrient and energy uptake, the presence of pesticide residues could, however, counterbalance these benefits and negatively affect human health. This systematic review provides an overview of studies on pesticide residues during the last decade and the related human health risk assessment. Thirty-five original articles published since 2010 reporting the levels of pesticide residues in raw cow's milk in 69 regions from 15 countries were reviewed. Data showed that pesticide residue levels were ranked as, DDTs> permethrin> bifenthrin> Drins> endrin> endosulfan> HCHs> cyhalothrin> cypermethrin> heptachlor> ethion> coumaphos> deltamethrin> dimethoate, chlorpyriphos> profenofos> malathion> dichlorvos> parathion methyl> carbaryl> aldicarb> carbofuran> methamidophos. High geographic variation was observed, and many regions appear as contaminated zones with high risks such as Punjab in Pakistan (× 3080 > MRL and × 113 > MRL for Cypermethrin and Drins, respectively), Sand Pedro in Columbia (× 1090 > MRL and × 200 > MRL for endrin and Drins, respectively), and Gezira State in Sudan (× 109 > MRL DDTs). The risk assessment for humans indicated that HQ Drins values were > 1 in Columbia (Sucre, Casa Azul, San Pedro, Costanera, Sabanas, Sinú Medio, and San Jorge regions), and in Pakistan (Punjab region). Moreover, the HQ values for endrin were > 1 in Sinú Medio (Colombia) and for heptachlor in Costanera region, Sinú Medio, and Sabanas (Colombia). Furthermore, HI values were > 1 in seven regions in Colombia, 1 region in Pakistan, 1 region in Egypt and 1 region in Turkey, suggesting a serious health risk. In conclusion, to avoid cow's milk contamination by pesticides, it is necessary to develop eco-friendly alternatives to chemical pesticides and promote integrated pest management (IPM) strategies. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Study design: The diversity of microflora inhabiting endplate (EP) and nucleus pulposus (NP) tissues of human intervertebral disc (IVD) was profiled through NGS-supported 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Sixteen EP and their corresponding NP were excised from the brain-dead voluntary organ donors with no clinical history of low back pain, and 12 herniated and 8 degenerated NP tissues isolated from the patients undergoing spinal surgery were subjected to study the alteration in the microbial diversity. Objective(s): To understand in normal IVD, whether the colonization of bacteria to the NP is through the EP in discs with intact annulus fibrosus. To identify significantly differing microbial population(s) between normal and diseased IVD (NP). Background of the study: There is increasing evidence for subclinical infection by fastidious low, growing bacteria to be a cause of disc degeneration. Although the presence of bacteria in NP has been reported well in literature, the source of bacteria is not clearly proved as the disc is avascular in healthy condition. Documentation of similar bacterial populations in the EP and NP may add proof that bacterial inoculation of NP occurs via the EP. Materials and methods: Sixteen EP and their corresponding NP excised from brain-dead voluntary organ donors with no history of back pain and 20 diseased discs collected from patients undergoing microdiscectomy/fusion surgery were used for profiling microbiome through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing using primers specific for V1-V9 hypervariable regions. Changes in bacterial diversity and abundance were analysed to identify the key microbial populations in normal IVD NP and EP tissues and those significantly altered in diseased IVD (NP). Results: NP and EP shared a similar spectrum of microbiome but with varying abundance. The five dominant phyla identified were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, OD1, and Bacteroidetes. Proteobacteria was found to be the most abundant phyla in both NP (62%) and EP (53%) of the normal IVD. This was followed by Firmicutes (16%), Actinobacteriota (11%), OD1 (Parcubacteria) (7.6%), and Bacteroidetes (2%) in NP and Firmicutes (23.4%), OD1 (Parcubacteria) (17.6%), Actinobacteriota (2.8%), and Bacteroidetes (2.6%) in EP, respectively. Under diseased conditions, Proteobacteria (68%) was dominant when compared with other phyla. However, there was no significant difference in the abundance of Proteobacteria between the normal and diseased discs. Interestingly, the other dominant phyla such as Firmicutes (Normal-NP: 16.2%; Diseased-NP: 4.02%) and Actinobacteria (Normal-NP: 11%; Diseased-NP: 0.99%) showed a significant reduction in degenerated discs. To understand the key microbial populations that are significantly altered during disease, correlation analysis was performed among the three phyla, which revealed a negative correlation in the ratio of Actinobacteria + Firmicutes vs. Proteobacteria (p = 0.001) in DD. Conclusion: Results of our study clearly demonstrated a similar bacterial diversity but with varying abundance between the EP and NP, suggesting the existence of the endplate–nucleus pulposus axis in the normal IVD microbiome. Further, our results have indicated that the changes in the abundance of Actinobacteria + Firmicutes vs. Proteobacteria during DDD need further investigation.

	abstract = {Micropollutants (MPs) include a wide range of biological disruptors that can be toxic to wildlife and humans at very low concentrations (<1 μg/L). These mainly anthropogenic pollutants have been widely detected in different areas of the planet, including the deep sea, and have impacts on marine life. Because of this potential toxicity, the global distribution, quantity, incidence, and potential impacts of deep-sea MPs were investigated in a systematic review of the literature. The results showed that MPs have reached different zones of the ocean and are more frequently reported in the Northern Hemisphere, where higher concentrations are found. MPs are also concentrated in depths up to 3000 m, where they are also more frequently studied, but also extend deeper than 10,000 m. Potentially toxic metals (PTMs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), organotins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified as the most prevalent and widely distributed MPs at ≥200 m depth. PTMs are widely distributed in the deep sea in high concentrations; aluminum is the most prevalent up to 3000 m depth, followed by zinc and copper. PCBs, organotins, hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), PAHs, and phenols were detected accumulated in both organisms and environmental samples above legislated thresholds or known toxicity levels. Our assessment indicated that the deep sea can be considered a sink for MPs. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Stem cells (SCs) therapy for intervertebral disc degeneration (IDD) has been studied for nearly 20 years and it is an important part of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering research, as well as a current research hotspot and challenge. Although the volume of literature has shown an annual growth trend, there is no literature available for bibliometric and clinical analysis of the content of multiple databases in this field. Methods: The articles were obtained from the WOSCC, Scopus, Pubmed, and ClinicalTrials on 27 December 2021. Three scientometric software (VOSviewer 1.6.17, CiteSpace 5.8.R.1 and Scimago Graphica) were used to perform bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis. Results: We included 867 articles from WOSCC, 716 articles from Scopus and 6 clinical studies from ClinicalTrials for literature analysis. Our results showed that China was the country with the highest number of publications, with the United States (US) being the leader in terms of international collaborations and the number of citations. Sakai D, Grad S and Hoyland JA had made outstanding contributions for their high productivity and the quality articles. Spine was the most published and most cited journal, in addition to Spine Journal and Biomaterials, which were also more authoritative journals and had received high citations. All of them had received high citations. Keyword co-occurrence studies suggested that the current hotspots were in mechanistic studies, including inflammation, apoptosis, exosome, autophagy, and others. Some studies had also investigated tissue-engineered scaffolds of SCs to better repair degenerated discs. Clinical studies were relatively scarce. Direct injection of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) into degenerated discs for the treatment of Degenerative disc disease (DDD) was the current direction of research. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the global research hotspots, trends and clinical use of SCs in the treatment of IDD. It can help scholars to quickly understand the current status and hotspots of research in this field, and also provide some guidance and reference for those who are currently researching in this area.

	abstract = {Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA) has been used as an alternative of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in the fluoropolymer industry for several years. HFPO-TA is reported to have high capability of bioaccumulation, widespread environmental distribution, and multiple toxicities. However, its potential toxicity on the intestines and gut microbiota remains unknown. In the present study, male mice were orally exposed to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA for 6 weeks, and after total genomic DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing was performed. Our results demonstrated that HFPO-TA exposure resulted in the imbalance of cecal microbiota and alterations of cecal microbiota diversity. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Deferribacteres, and Tenericutes increased in mice after exposure to HFPO-TA, while the relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, and TM7 decreased. At the genus level, the relative abundances of Ver Akkermansia, Pre Prevotella, Lac Coprococcus, Por_Parabacteroides, and Lac Dorea decreased in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Meanwhile, the increased relative abundances of Def_Mucispirillum, Des_Desulfovibrio and Odo Odoribacter were observed in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Additionally, KEGG metabolic pathway analysis revealed that HFPO-TA exposure changed the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism, galactose metabolism pathway and other metabolic pathways. Collectively, all these findings indicate the potential gut toxicity of HFPO-TA and is perceived as a risk of health on gut microbiota. Future investigations should be warranted. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are effective techniques for the removal of PPCPs from water environments. In AOPs, different types of free radicals (HO·, SO4·−, O2·−, etc.) are generated to decompose PPCPs into non-toxic and small-molecule compounds, finally leading to the decomposition of PPCPs. This review systematically summarizes the features of various AOPs and the removal of PPCPs by different free radicals. The operation conditions and comprehensive performance of different types of free radicals are summarized, and the reaction mechanisms are further revealed. This review will provide a quick understanding of AOPs for later researchers. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are lipophilic environmental toxins, and the level of chemicals accumulated in the body through the food chain has been linked to the incidence of diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and cancer. We analyzed the concentration of POPs and circulating metabolites and investigated the associations between the concentration of plasma metabolites and the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) to determine the effect of the accumulation of POPs in human samples. Metabolic profiling of plasma from 276 Korean participants was performed using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and statistical analyses. The concentrations of PCBs and OCPs in each sample were measured. Correlation analysis and a covariate-adjusted general linear model (GLM) were used to investigate the association of the concentration of POPs with circulating metabolites in human blood samples. We found that four categories of Σ6PCBs and Σ5OCPs based on rank were significantly correlated with 4 and 5 metabolites, respectively, after adjusting for confounding factors, including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, alcohol intake, physical activity, triglycerides, and total cholesterol. According to the GLM analyses, 3 metabolites, namely, creatinine, acetate, and formate, among the 4 correlated metabolites were associated with four categories of rank-based Σ6PCBs. On the other hand, the quartiles of the rank-based Σ5OCPs were not associated with any circulating metabolites among the 5 correlated metabolites. Our findings indicate that the metabolites related to short-chain fatty acids and creatine can be useful risk indicators for estimating the effect of PCB exposure. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is one of the most common pregnancy complications globally. Environmental risk factors may lead to increased glucose levels and GDM, which in turn may affect not only the health of the mother but assuming hypotheses of "fetal programming", also the health of the offspring. In addition to traditional GDM risk factors, the evidence is growing that environmental influences might affect the development of GDM. We conducted a systematic review analyzing the association between several environmental health risk factors in pregnancy, including climate factors, chemicals and metals, and GDM. Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science Core Collection databases for research articles published until March 2021. Epidemiological human and animal model studies that examined GDM as an outcome and / or glycemic outcomes and at least one environmental risk factor for GDM were included. Results: Of n = 91 studies, we classified n = 28 air pollution, n = 18 persistent organic pollutants (POP), n = 11 arsenic, n = 9 phthalate n = 8 bisphenol A (BPA), n = 8 seasonality, n = 6 cadmium and n = 5 ambient temperature studies. In total, we identified two animal model studies. Whilst we found clear evidence for an association between GDM and air pollution, ambient temperature, season, cadmium, arsenic, POPs and phthalates, the findings regarding phenols were rather inconsistent. There were clear associations between adverse glycemic outcomes and air pollution, ambient temperature, season, POPs, phenols, and phthalates. Findings regarding cadmium and arsenic were heterogeneous (n = 2 publications in each case). Conclusions: Environmental risk factors are important to consider in the management and prevention of GDM. In view of mechanisms of fetal programming, the environmental risk factors investigated may impair the health of mother and offspring in the short and long term. Further research is needed. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {In this study, we utilized an untargeted NMR metabolomics approach to identify the vector response in terms of metabolic profiling after temperature and insecticide exposure in comparison with the control. Clearly, temperature and insecticide exposure cause changes in the underlying metabolism, and the NMR metabolomic profile enables a direct examination of the immediate response of the vector to cope up with these changes. The present study was designed in four parts: A-Aedes aegypti were exposed to 40 °C for one-hour, DDT-4%, malathion-5%, and deltamethrin-0.05% separately and, part B-D; one-hour exposure at 35 °C and 40 °C temperatures followed by one-hour exposure to insecticide. The resultant metabolite profiles were compared with the control. In response to temperature and insecticide exposure, several metabolites and altered pathways were identified. Citrate, maltose, lipids, Nicotinate, Choline, Pyruvate and β-hydroxybutyrate were found as important components of major biological pathways such as tri-carboxylic acid cycle, branched amino acid degradation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide PRPP pathway, and phospholipid metabolism. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the changes imposed by exposure to temperature and insecticides individually, are reversed with combined exposure, thus negating the impact of each other and posing a threat to the control of Aedes-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {The ubiquitous presence of pentachlorophenol (PCP) in ocean environments threatens marine organisms. However, its effects on immunity of marine invertebrates at environmentally realistic levels are still largely unknown. In this study, the immunotoxicity of PCP to a representative bivalve species was evaluated. In addition, its impacts on metabolism, energy supply, detoxification, and oxidative stress status were also analysed by physiological examination as well as comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses to reveal potential mechanisms underpinning. Results illustrated that the immunity of blood clams was evidently hampered upon PCP exposure. Additionally, significant alterations in energy metabolism were detected in PCP-exposed clams. Meanwhile, the expressions of key detoxification genes and the in vivo contents (or activity) of key detoxification enzymes were markedly altered. Exposure to PCP also triggered significant elevations in intracellular ROS and MDA whereas evident suppression of haemocyte viability. The abovementioned findings were further supported by transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses. Our results suggest that PCP may hamper the immunity of the blood clam by (i) constraining the cellular energy supply through disrupting metabolism; and (ii) damaging haemocytes through inducing oxidative stress. Considering the high similarity of immunity among species, many marine invertebrates may be threatened by PCP, which deserves more attention. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Despite increasing regulatory efforts to reduce production of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), continued human and ecological exposure to PFAS has led to concerns about historical releases. Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide important conduits between waste sources and the environment. We present a meta-analysis of results reported in 44 peer-reviewed publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples, collected from 21 countries, for which some or all of five perfluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were measured. Our meta analysis revealed global patterns and trends that, to our knowledge, have not been reported elsewhere. Regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the PFAS and the corresponding mean concentration for each country. Although legacy compounds, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have been reported with the highest measured concentrations, their global temporal trends are lowest of all PFAS considered. Concentrations of most PFAS analyzed in wastewater in the United States have not changed significantly with time, whereas reported PFAS concentrations in wastewater effluent from China have increased from 11% to 37% per year. In addition, our results show significant positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent concentrations of individual PFAS and the gross domestic product per capita of each country. Our analysis of this global data set also confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets: (i) none of the PFAS studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes; (ii) effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher PFAS concentrations; and (iii) the few studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) indicate that PFAS adsorbed to SPM can contribute significantly to the total PFAS load. © 2022},

	abstract = {Previous studies have examined the effects of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) on disruption of the blood-testis barrier and spermatogenesis. Sertoli and Leydig cells were perturbed, resulting in a decrease in testosterone levels and sperm counts. However, the effects of PFOS on male fecundity are not limited to the testes. In this study, we demonstrated that oral PFOS exposure (1 μg/g BW and 5 μg/g BW) decreased the function of the Luteinizing hormone (LH)/Luteinizing hormone receptor (LHr) and decreased epididymal sperm motility. Consistently, testicular transcriptome analysis revealed that PFOS altered the expression of a cluster of genes associated with sperm motility and steroidogenesis. In mice exposed to PFOS, c-Fos immunostaining showed activation of the lateral septal nucleus (LS), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), locus coeruleus (LC), which are known to be related to anxiety-like behaviors. Metabolomic analyses of the hypothalamus revealed that exposure to PFOS perturbed the translation of proteins, as well as the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Altogether, the activation of brain nuclei, shift of hypothalamic metabolome, and reduction of LH/LHr circuit resulted from PFOS exposure suggested the toxicant's systematic effects on male reproduction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Mounting evidence indicates that tumor-derived exosomes (TDEs) play critical roles in tumor development and progression by regulating components in the tumor microenvironment (TME) in an autocrine or paracrine manner. Moreover, due to their delivery of critical molecules that react to chemotherapy and immunotherapy, TDEs also contribute to tumor drug resistance and impede the effective response of antitumor immunotherapy, thereby leading to poor clinical outcomes. There is a pressing need for the inhibition or removal of TDEs to facilitate the treatment and prognosis of cancer patients. Here, in the present review, we systematically overviewed the current strategies for TDE inhibition and clearance, providing novel insights for future tumor interventions in translational medicine.

A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few studies are available. Further studies are needed to validate the possible associations. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Layered double hydroxides (LDHs), one of the most important 2D heterostructure materials, have provided massive improvements for various applications in many fields. Especially, their application in water treatment as efficient catalysts owing to their unique features such as tunable structure, excellent thermal stability and regeneration performances. LDHs represent an eco-friendly alternative to conventional catalysts especially for the degradation of noxious emerging contaminants in aqueous solution. They have the ability to host anions in their interlayer structure and the particularity of having a memory effect which facilitates the phenomena of regeneration. Thus, this paper discusses the available knowledge about the synthesis of LDHs and their derivative catalysts, and the factors affecting in AOPs for the removal of emerging compounds. Incontestably, LDHs and LDH-based materials possess an exceptional flexible structure with adsorption ability and catalytic activity, which allows them to be extensively employed in the environmental remediation of emerging contaminants in water. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Background: The goal of this study was to systematically review the management and outcomes of patients who developed pseudoaneurysm (PA) after carotid endarterectomy (postendarterectomy PA [PEPA]). Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from date of inception to June 2022. Studies were selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Simultaneously, a retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent neurosurgical evaluation of suspected PEPA at our institution. Results: Of the 321 articles in the original literature search, 62 were selected. A total of 143 patients (93 men, 27 women; mean age, 70.7 years) diagnosed with PEPA were included. Mean time from carotid endarterectomy to PA diagnosis was 41.8 months. Primary repair data were available for 135 patients, including 19 with primary closures, 112 with patch or graft repairs, and 4 with eversion procedures. Fifty-five patients with PA (39%) presented with infection. Staphylococcal species were the most common causative organism. Of infected PAs, 89.1% were treated with open procedures. Overall complication rates of PAs treated via open, endovascular, and hybrid methods were 31%, 15.4%, and 0%, respectively. Open ligation (42.9%) and aneurysmectomy with grafting (36.4%) resulted in the highest rates of complications. Conclusions: Despite higher complication rates after open repair strategies, use of these techniques remains a viable option in situations requiring removal of infected patches or evacuation of large extravascular collections. Endovascular treatment options are associated with low numbers of complications and can be considered for primary PEPA treatment when infection is not present. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Due to anthropogenic activities, a large number of pollutants are disposed into the environment. The microbial communities in the environment are immensely diverse and critical mediators of various ecosystem processes. But it is not clearly known to what extent xenobiotics effect the composition and functionality of environmental microorganisms, across biomes in different geographic locations, with varying contaminating sources, categories of chemical pollutants, and their application types. Here, we investigated the impact of xenobiotics by metagenomic analysis of 16S rRNA from seawater, soil, sludge and sediment, for deciphering microbial diversity, community structure, functional enrichment and metabolic potentiality in relation to the application of pesticide (metaldehyde), herbicide (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; DCPAA), insecticide (chlordecone) and flame retardant additives (organophosphate triesters; OPT and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate; TCEP). Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum consisting of Clostridia, in association with DCPAA (Lutispora sp.), metaldehyde and TCEP treatments. The next two abundant phyla were Proteobacteria [class Deltaproteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria (Pelagibacter ubique with OPT treatment) and Gammaproteobacteria], and Euryarchaeota consisting mostly of Methanobacteria with chlordecone and DCPAA. Both Desulfomicrobium and Sedimentibacter were predominant in the subtropical moist forest sediment, while Synechococcus and Pelagibacter dominated the temperate Mediterranean Sea. Ruminococcus and Lutispora were more abundant in rain forest compared to waste water solid, while Anaerovorax predominated subtropical moist forest. Sequences involved in house-keeping genes comprised the most abundant hits. The genes involved in environmental information processing such as ABC transporters catalyzing carbohydrate uptake, membrane transport and quorum sensing were over-represented with TCEP, DCPAA, OPT and metaldehyde. Exposure to different classes of xenobiotics revealed major differences in microbial structure and function abundances, mainly driven by environmental sources and biomes. Preponderance of core metabolic functional genes across all the metagenomes analysed is indicative of microbial community responding and adjusting itself to deal with these treatments and maintain its balance. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Constructed wetlands (CWs) can effectively treat landfill leachate (LL). However, there is limited research on the removal of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) refractory organics during LL treatment in CWs. In this study, multi-stage subsurface flow CWs was used to treat LL, and the removal fate of hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in CWs was investigated. The structural differences between plant roots and substrate microbial communities were compared and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) metabolic pathway of organic matter was analyzed based on metagenomic analysis. The results showed that substrate adsorption (50.55%–72.74%) and microbial degradation (20.38%–27.89%) were the main ways to remove OCPs. The Proteobacteria occupied a dominant position in the CWs system, among which Betaproteobacteria (34.37%–35.90%) were contained in the substrate, and Alphaproteobacteria (21.19%–23.84%) was a more dominant microorganism in plant roots. Formaldehyde assimilation and serine pathway were the main pathways of methane metabolism. This study provides a reference for the removal mechanism of OCPs to promote the application of CWs technology in LL treatment. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

Well-defined compositions of the GAP-FP copolymers in two different GAP to FP ratios (1:1 and 1:3) were synthesized by tailoring the desired molecular weights of each block in the copolymer, demonstrating the synthetic versatility of such a copolymer system. The resultant GAP-FP copolymers represent a unique hybrid binder system with tunable energy releasing and oxidizing potentials intended for metallized formulations. Thermogravimetric analysis showed that the carbonaceous residue usually formed from the decomposition of GAP could be reduced significantly by the copolymerization with FP. Isoconversional method of kinetic analysis of the GAP-FP copolymers revealed an increasing dependence of the effective activation energy on the extent of conversion. The increasing dependence suggested a mechanism of the competing reactions that were found to be between the reactions of FP triggered oxidation and intermolecular crosslinking of the polyimine intermediates formed from GAP decomposition that ultimately resulted in the reduction of the carbonaceous residue. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Intertrochanteric hip fractures are common and devastating injuries, especially for the elderly. Surgical treatment is the optimal strategy for managing intertrochanteric fractures as it allows early rehabilitation and functional recovery. The relative effects of internal fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fracture after operation remain limited to relatively small studies which create uncertainty in attempts to establish evidence-based best practice. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the clinical effectiveness of two commonly used intramedullary devices: a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) versus a single-screw cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation) in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. The following outcomes were considered: revisions, implant-related failures, non-unions, pain, Harris hip score and intra-operative outcomes. Odds ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in brackets are reported. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria: two randomised controlled trials and four observational studies enrolling 970 patients with a mean age of 77 years and 64% of patients being female. There was a statistically significant difference (p value < 0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13–0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09–0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34–0.74). There was no difference in non-unions and Harris hip score (p value > 0.05). There was a significant difference in blood loss and fluoroscopy usage in favour of PFNA, while no difference in operating times was observed between the two devices. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) is clinically more effective when compared to a single-screw cephalomedullary nail proximal femoral nail antirotation resulting in fewer complications, fewer revisions and fewer patients complaining of pain. No difference has been established regarding non-unions and Harris hip score. Intra-operative outcomes favour PFNA with less blood loss and fluoroscopy usage. Further studies are warranted to explore the cost-effectiveness of these and other implants in managing patients with intertrochanteric fractures. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Leishmaniasis is a tropical disease caused by a protozoan parasite Leishmania that is transmitted via infected female sandflies. At present, leishmaniasis treatment mainly counts on chemotherapy. The currently available drugs against leishmaniasis are costly, toxic, with multiple side effects, and limitations in the administration route. The rapid emergence of drug resistance has severely reduced the potency of anti-leishmanial drugs. As a result, there is a pressing need for the development of novel anti-leishmanial drugs with high potency, low cost, acceptable toxicity, and good pharmacokinetics features. Due to the availability of preclinical data, drug repurposing is a valuable approach for speeding up the development of effective anti-leishmanial through pointing to new drug targets in less time, having low costs and risk. Metabolic pathways of this parasite play a crucial role in the growth and proliferation of Leishmania species during the various stages of their life cycle. Based on available genomics/proteomics information, known pathways-based (sterol biosynthetic pathway, purine salvage pathway, glycolysis, GPI biosynthesis, hypusine, polyamine biosynthesis) Leishmania-specific proteins could be targeted with known drugs that were used in other diseases, resulting in finding new promising anti-leishmanial therapeutics.

	abstract = {Hydrogenation of CO2 to value-added chemicals and fuels not only effectively alleviates climate change but also reduces over-dependence on fossil fuels. Therefore, much attention has been paid to the chemical conversion of CO2 to value-added products, such as liquid fuels and aromatics. Recently, efficient catalysts have been developed to face the challenge of the chemical inertness of CO2 and the difficulty of C–C coupling. Considering the lack of a detailed summary on hydrogenation of CO2 to liquid fuels and aromatics via the Fischer–Tropsch synthesis (FTS) route, we conducted a comprehensive and systematic review of the research progress on the development of efficient catalysts for hydrogenation of CO2 to liquid fuels and aromatics. In this work, we summarized the factors influencing the catalytic activity and stability of various catalysts, the strategies for optimizing catalytic performance and product distribution, the effects of reaction conditions on catalytic performance, and possible reaction mechanisms for CO2 hydrogenation via the FTS route. Furthermore, we also provided an overview of the challenges and opportunities for future research associated with hydrogenation of CO2 to liquid fuels and aromatics. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Background: Perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are widely used synthetic aliphatic compounds. This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations. Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for relevant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (≥18 years old) and children. Primary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between concentrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were performed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool. Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associations between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations. Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human populations. Future research should be conducted on the less well-studied PFAS to explore their effects on human health and in regions where such studies are currently lacking. (300 words) © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

The purpose of this study is determination of the concentration of VOCs such as alachlor, anthracene, benzene, bromoform, chloroform, heptachlor, isophorone, tetrachloroethylene, γ -chlordane, toluene, etc. in water matrices. The results showed that among studies conducted on VOCs, the concentration of tetrachloroethylene, m,p-xylene, and toluene were at the top in water matrices, and the lowest average concentrations were found in chloroform, anthracene, and butyl benzyl phthalate. In terms of VOC concentrations in water matrices, China was the most polluted country. Moreover, the data analysis indicated that China was the only country with carcinogenic risk. A Monte-Carlo simulation showed that although the averages obtained were comparable to the acceptable limits, for heptachlor, the maximum carcinogenic risk is achieved at a level that is slightly over the limit, only 25% from the population being exposed. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {There is increasing need for biodiversity monitoring, especially in places where potential anthropogenic disturbance may significantly impact ecosystem health. We employed a combination of traditional morphological and bulk macroinvertebrate metabarcoding analyses to benthic samples collected from Toronto Harbour (Ontario, Canada) to compare taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrates and their responses to environmental gradients. At the species rank, sites assessed using COI metabarcoding showed more variation than sites assessed using morphological methods. Depending on the assessment method, we detected gradients in magnesium (morphological taxa), ammonia (morphological taxa, COI sequence variants), pH (18S sequence variants) as well as gradients in contaminants such as metals (COI & 18S sequence variants) and organochlorines (COI sequence variants). Observed responses to contaminants such as aromatic hydrocarbons and metals align with known patchy distributions in harbour sediments. We determined that the morphological approach may limit the detection of macroinvertebrate responses to lake environmental conditions due to the effort needed to obtain fine level taxonomic assignments necessary to investigate responses. DNA metabarcoding, however, need not be limited to macroinvertebrates, can be automated, and taxonomic assignments are associated with a certain level of accuracy from sequence variants to named taxonomic groups. The capacity to detect change using a scalable approach such as metabarcoding is critical for addressing challenges associated with biodiversity monitoring and ecological investigations. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Objective: Due to their high worldwide prevalence, pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFD's) are a public health problem. There is high heterogeneity in the types and effectiveness of conservative treatment. The objective was to analyze the scientific evidence on conservative treatment of PFDs in women. Methods: Umbrella review, covering MEDLINE (1950–2019), Scopus (1960–2019), Web of Science (1980–2019), and Cochrane Library (2000–2019). Inclusion criterion: review on conservative treatments about pelvic floor disorders in the adult women, in Spanish or English; exclusion criterion: studies about other urological, gynecological, and coloproctological pathologies, among others. Results: Thirty-two reviews (2000–2019) and 12 meta-analyses were included. 53.1% showed an improvement on urinary incontinence. Pelvic floor muscle training worked on 70.6% of them, followed by electrical stimulation and estrogen (11.7%), and weight loss (5.9%). 6.3% of reviews and meta-analyses fulfilled all items in PRISMA, and 93.7% of them fulfilled more than 60% of the checklist. 60% de los ítems. Conclusions: PFMT and weight loss are the most effective treatments for UI, but there is no evidence for other PFDs. The methodological quality of conservative treatments must be improved for a more effective treatment of PFDs in women. Pelvic floor muscle training and weight loss are the most effective treatments for urinary incontinence. Only 6.3% of the reviews fulfilled all PRISMA ítems. © 2022 International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics.},

After sequencing on Oxford's Nanopore platform, a total of 7864 reads with an average read length of 2800bp, and a mean G + C% of 50 ± 7 were observed. STAMP, METAGENassist, MG RAST, PAST, MEGAN, and Community analyzer were used for the taxonomic and functional screening. The dominant phyla Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Chlorobi, Actinobacteria and dominant species Sulfuricurvum kujiense, Chlorobaculum tepidum, Allochromaticum vinosum, Desulfomicrobium baculatum, Thiobacillus denitrificans were observed. The metagenomic data was then compared to four metagenomes from the same site which are publicly available on EBI Metagenomics with run accession numbers ERR947518, ERR947519, ERR947520, and ERR947521. At the phyla level, all five metagenomes consist of Proteobacteria, Acidobacteria, Thermotogae, Planctomycetes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, and at the species level Serratia proteamaculans, T. denitrificans, Serratia odorifera, Strenotrophomonas maltophilia as the core microbes. The functional analysis shows that all metagenomes contain pathways for the degradation of benzene, nitrotoluene, and DDT with the detection of other xenobiotic remediation pathways through MG RAST. While degradation pathways of dehalogenation, atrazine, and aromatic hydrocarbon were commonly found in all five metagenomes through METAGENassist. Enzymes mapped on xenobiotic degradation pathways commonly belong to the class oxidoreductase, lyase, and transferase. Along with basic cell metabolism, genes involved in xenobiotics degradation were also annotated prevalently. This omics-based comparative metagenomic characterization drains out information about pollutants removing novel microbes and will also help in the development of a clean-up scheme for xenobiotics contaminated environments. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

We used linear regression to examine associations between plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUDA on serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin. We used quantile g-computation to estimate associations with a PFAS mixture for each simultaneous, one-quartile change in PFAS concentrations. Results: Each doubling of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, or PFNA concentrations was associated with higher AST, GGT, and ALP concentrations. Each doubling of PFOA concentrations was associated with 16.5% (95%CI: 10.4, 23.0) higher GGT concentrations among adults not meeting Canada’s physical activity guidelines vs. 6.6% (95%CI: -1.6, 15.5) among those meeting these guidelines. Sex and BMI also modified some associations, though to a lesser extent. We did not observe associations between ALT and PFOA (1.2% change; 95%CI: -2.5, 4.9), PFOS (2.2% change; 95%CI: -0.8, 5.3), or PFHxS (1.5% change; 95%CI: -0.4, 3.4). We also did not observe consistent associations for PFDA and PFUDA or with total bilirubin. In quantile g-computation models, each simultaneous one-quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was positively associated with AST (7.5% higher; 95%CI: 4.0, 10.4), GGT (9.7% higher; 95%CI: 1.7, 17.0), and ALP (2.8% higher; 95%CI: 0.5, 5.4). Conclusion: Higher plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA – both individually and as a mixture – were associated with higher serum concentrations of liver function biomarkers. These results contribute to emerging evidence suggesting that higher levels of physical activity appear to be protective against the hepatotoxic effects of PFOA. This work contributes to a growing body of evidence supporting the hepatotoxic effects of PFAS. © 2022, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Background: This study aimed to systematically analyze the relationship between preterm (PT), low birth weight (LBW), and developmental defects of enamel (DDE) in the primary dentition. Methods: Following the retrieval of the databases, case–control studies, cross-sectional studies, and cohort studies on the relationship between PT, LBW and DDE, which had been published in English or Chinese up to January 2022 were included. The data about odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were extracted and calculated using STATA 12.0 Software. Case–control studies were evaluated using the Newcastle–Ottawa Scale (NOS), while cross-sectional studies and cohort studies were evaluated using the JBI scale. The heterogeneity of each study was evaluated using the Q test. Results: A total of 15 studies were included, of which 8 studied the relationship between PT and DDE, and 13 explored the relationship between LBW and DDE including three about the relationship between very low birth weight (VLBW) and DDE. Seven studies explored the relationship between PT, LBW, and DDE. The results of this meta-analysis showed that both PT and LBW especially VLBW (OR= 7.19, 95% CI: 4.98–10.38) were risk factors for DDE in the primary dentition (OR= 2.33, 95% CI: 1.55–3.51) (OR= 1.67, 95% CI: 1.08–2.59). The subgroup results showed that PT and LBW were both associated with the occurrence of enamel hypoplasia (EHP) (OR= 6.89, 95% CI: 3.33–14.34; OR= 2.78, 95% CI: 2.10–3.68) rather than enamel opacity (OR= 0.94, 95% CI: 0.55–1.61; OR= 1.03, 95% CI: 0.66–1.61). There was no publication bias about the included studies (P = 0.75 > 0.05; P = 0.47 > 0.05). Conclusion: This meta-analysis demonstrated that both PT and LBW especially VLBW are associated with a higher risk of DDE in the primary dentition. PT and LBW are both related to the occurrence of EHP. However, the relationship between PT, LBW, and enamel opacity has not been verified.

	abstract = {Seventy percent of women with pelvic floor dysfunctions (PFDs) are estimated to present deficient consciousness of their pelvic floor muscles (PFMs) and poor ability to contract them. Improving the proprioception of PFMs, defined as the capacity to know the status and position of each body part, and adequately contracting them could be a protective factor to prevent the appearance of PFDs in the general female population. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of educational interventions and verbal instructions on how to contract and exercise the PFMs to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women. A systematic search of studies published in the last 20 years until March 2022 was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, Lilacs, and Dialnet databases. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity in the types of studies and included populations. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for the design, search, and reporting of studies. The methodological quality was analysed via the PEDro and the Newcastle–Ottawa scales in the case of randomised clinical trials and non-randomised studies, respectively, while the quality of evidence was determined using the SIGN grading system for evidence-based guidelines. Descriptive and experimental studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that evaluated the contractile capability of the PFMs in healthy women or women without a previous diagnosis of PFD were included. Seven articles that included a total of 2507 women were found, three of which were clinical trials with PEDro scores between 5 and 9 points out of 10 and four of which were non-randomised studies with NOS scores between 6 and 8 points out of 10. The outcomes were measured through vaginal palpation, visual observation, questionnaires for PFD symptoms, and self-perception reports. This review discriminated between two types of intervention, educational programmes and verbal instructions, and evaluated the changes observed in PFM strength and knowledgeability and the symptoms of PFDs. The findings showed that educational interventions and verbal instructions improve the proprioception of PFMs in women of all ages that are healthy or without a previous diagnosis of PFDs as well as their knowledge about the pelvic floor, healthy lifestyle habits, and symptoms that are potentially indicative of PFDs. Further high-quality randomised clinical trials are warranted to draw definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of educational interventions to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women considered healthy or with mild symptoms that may be indicative of PFDs. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Gene expression-based biomarkers are regularly proposed as rapid, sensitive, and mechanistically informative tools to identify whether soil invertebrates experience adverse effects due to chemical exposure. However, before biomarkers could be deployed within diagnostic studies, systematic evidence of the robustness of such biomarkers to detect effects is needed. In our study, we present an approach for conducting a meta-analysis of the robustness of gene expression-based biomarkers in soil invertebrates. The approach was developed and trialed for two measurements of gene expression commonly proposed as biomarkers in soil ecotoxicology: earthworm metallothionein (MT) gene expression for metals and earthworm heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene expression for organic chemicals. We collected 294 unique gene expression data points from the literature and used linear mixed-effect models to assess concentration, exposure duration, and species effects on the quantified response. The meta-analysis showed that the expression of earthworm MT was strongly metal concentration dependent, stable over time and species independent. The metal concentration-dependent response was strongest for cadmium, indicating that this gene is a suitable biomarker for this metal. For copper, no clear concentration-dependent response of MT gene expression in earthworms was found, indicating MT is not a reliable biomarker for this metal. For HSP70, overall marginal up-regulation and lack of a concentration-dependent response indicated that this gene is not suitable as a biomarker for organic pollutant effects in earthworms. The present study demonstrates how meta-analysis can be used to assess the status of biomarkers. We encourage colleagues to apply this open-access approach to other biomarkers, as such quantitative assessment is a prerequisite to ensuring that the suitability and limitations of proposed biomarkers are known and stated.

	abstract = {Background: Recent epidemiologic research shows many environmental chemicals exhibit endocrine disrupting effects on the female reproductive system. Few studies have examined exposure at reproductive organs. Our aim was to perform a preliminary untargeted metabolomic characterization of menstrual blood, a novel biofluid, to identify environmental toxins present in the endometrium and evaluate the suitability of this sample type for exposome research. Methods: Whole blood menstrual samples were collected from four women using a menstrual cup. Samples were analyzed for small molecules that include both environmental chemicals and endogenous metabolites using untargeted liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA was used to identify differences within and between individuals' menstrual blood metabolomic profiles, and the influence of the sample processing method. To assess the presence of environmental exposures, LC-HRMS chemical profiles were matched to the ToxCast chemical database, which includes 4557 commonly used commercial chemicals. Select compounds were confirmed by comparison to reference standards. Results: PCA of metabolome profiles showed analysis of menstrual blood samples were highly reproducible, with high variability in detected metabolites between participants and low variability between analytical replicates of an individual's sample. Endogenous metabolites detected in menstrual blood samples achieved good coverage of the human blood metabolome. We found 1748 annotations for environmental chemicals, including suspected reproductive toxicants such as phenols, parabens, phthalates, and organochlorines. Storage temperature for the first 24 h did not significantly influence global metabolomic profiles. Conclusion: Our results show chemical exposures linked to reproductive toxicity and endocrine disruption are present in menstrual blood, a sampling medium for the endometrium. © 2022},

	abstract = {Micro/nanoplastic has become an emerging pollutant of global concern. At present, ecotoxic researches on micro/nanoplastics mostly focus on marine aquatic organisms and freshwater algae. Research on the ecological impacts of plastics on higher terrestrial plants, especially on forest plants, is relatively limited. Torreya grandis cv. Merrillii, a species of conifer in the family Taxaceae, is a unique and economically valuable tree species in China. The physiological and biochemical responses of T. grandis seedlings to polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) with a diameter of 100 nm were systematically studied inthe present study. The results showed that nanoplastics enhanced the accumulation of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and the activities of catalase and peroxidase. The concentrations of iron, sulfur, and zinc were reduced after nanoplastic exposure. PSNP treatment had an important effect on a series of chemical and genetic indicators of T. grandis, includingantioxidants, small RNA, gene transcription, protein expressions, and metabolite accumulation. Multi-omic analysis revealed that PSNPs modulate terpenoid- and flavonoid-biosynthesis pathways by regulating small RNA transcription and protein expression. Our study provided novelty insights into the responses of forest plants to nanoplastic treatment. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The most contemporary ecological issues are the dumping of unprocessed factories’ effluent. As a result, there is an increasing demand for creative, practical, environmentally acceptable, and inexpensive methodologies to remediate inorganic metals (Hg, Cr, Pb, and Cd) liquidated into the atmosphere, protecting ecosystems. Latest innovations in biological metals have driven natural treatment as a viable substitute for traditional approaches in this area. To eliminate pesticide remains from soil/water sites, technologies such as oxidation, burning, adsorption, and microbial degradation have been established. Bioremediation is a more cost-effective and ecologically responsible means of removing heavy metals than conventional alternatives. As a result, microorganisms have emerged as a necessary component of methyl breakdown and detoxification via metabolic reactions and hereditary characteristics. The utmost operative variant for confiscating substantial metals commencing contaminated soil was A. niger, which had a maximum bioaccumulation efficiency of 98% (Cd) and 43% (Cr). Biosensor bacteria are both environmentally sustainable and cost-effective. As a result, microbes have a range of metal absorption processes that allow them to have higher metal biosorption capabilities. Additionally, the biosorption potential of bacterium, fungus, biofilm, and algae, inherently handled microorganisms that immobilized microbial cells for the elimination of heavy metals, was reviewed in this study. Furthermore, we discuss some of the challenges and opportunities associated with producing effective heavy metal removal techniques, such as those that employ different types of nanoparticles. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: A major driver of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and poor clinical outcomes is suboptimal antibiotic use, although data are lacking in low-resource settings. We reviewed studies on systemic antibiotic use (WHO ATC/DDD category J01) for human health in Indonesia, and synthesized available evidence to identify opportunities for intervention. Methods: We systematically searched five international and national databases for eligible peer-reviewed articles, in English and Indonesian, published between 1 January 2000 and 1 June 2021 including: (1) antibiotic consumption; (2) prescribing appropriateness; (3) antimicrobial stewardship (AMS); (4) consumers’ and providers’ perceptions. Two independent reviewers included studies and extracted data. Study-level data were summarized using random-effects model meta-analysis for consumption and prescribing appropriateness, effect direction analysis for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions, and qualitative synthesis for perception surveys. (PROSPERO: CRD42019134641) Findings: Of 9323 search hits, we included 100 reports on antibiotic consumption (20), prescribing appropriateness (49), AMS interventions (13), and/or perception (25) (8 categorized in >1 domain). The pooled estimate of overall antibiotic consumption was 134.8 DDD per 100 bed-days (95%CI 82.5–187.0) for inpatients and 121.1 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (10.4-231.8) for outpatients. Ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and ampicillin were the most consumed antibiotics in inpatients, and amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and cefadroxil in outpatients. Pooled estimates for overall appropriate prescribing (according to Gyssens method) were 33.5% (18.1–53.4) in hospitals and 49.4% (23.7–75.4) in primary care. Pooled estimates for appropriate prescribing (according to reference guidelines) were, in hospitals, 99.7% (97.4–100) for indication, 84.9% (38.5-98.0) for drug choice, and 6.1% (0.2–63.2) for overall appropriateness, and, in primary care, 98.9% (60.9-100) for indication, 82.6% (50.5–95.7) for drug choice and 10.5% (0.8–62.6) for overall appropriateness. Studies to date evaluating bundled AMS interventions, although sparse and heterogeneous, suggested favourable effects on antibiotic consumption, prescribing appropriateness, guideline compliance, and patient outcomes. Key themes identified in perception surveys were lack of community antibiotic knowledge, and common non-prescription antibiotic self-medication. Interpretation: Context-specific intervention strategies are urgently needed to improve appropriate antibiotic use in Indonesian hospitals and communities, with critical evidence gaps concerning the private and informal healthcare sectors.

In order to study the distribution characteristics and quality status of heavy metals in the surface sediments of Zhenzhu Bay mangrove wetland, the authors collected 13 surface sediment samples in the mangrove distribution area of Zhenzhu Bay on September in 2021 to analyze the heavy metal content. The results shows that the eontent of heavy metals in the surface sediments of Zhenzhu Bay mangrove wetland is relatively low compared with other mangrove wetlands in China. Only some stations showed weak Cd and Hg pollution and most stations wasn't plolluted by heavy metals, with two showed weak Cd and Hg pollution according to the geo-aeeumulation index, and all stations in the bay are at low ecological risk based on potential risk index method. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis show that Cd was mainly affected by the input of Jiangping River and mariculture in the southeast of Zhenzhu Bay, and other elements were mainly affected by the weathering and normal deposition of natural background rocks. The contribution rates of Jiangping River input and Zhenzhu Bay marie ulture were 57% and 4 3 % respectively through PCA -MLR model analysis on the heavy metal souree. The results show that the overall ecological condition of the Zhenzhu Bay Mangrove Wetland is good, however, it is still necessary to pay attention to the input of Cd. © 2024 Editorial Board of Journal of Agro-Environment Science.

	abstract = {Background: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is widely used throughout different industries, including the food industry, because it is resistant to heat and prevents water or oil from easily permeating into or contaminating materials coated by PFOA. Although many studies have reported an association between PFOA exposure and the risk of developing hepatic diseases, it is still in debate because they have shown conflicting results. Therefore, this study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis on the relationship between PFOA exposure and hepatic diseases. Methods: This study searched studies related to hepatic diseases due to PFOA exposure until 31 December 2021, using PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. This study performed a systematic review and meta-analysis through research question development, literature screening, data extraction, and risk of bias evaluation. This study found 8280 studies after excluding duplicate literature and selected 5 studies in the final stage. Among them, two studies were included in the meta-analysis. Results: The results of the meta-analysis showed that the ALT of people exposed to PFOA was 117% higher than the ALT of those not exposed to PFOA, and it was significantly different (OR = 1.167; 95% CI, 1.086–1.254). Conclusion: However, since the number of studies included in the analysis was not large enough to conclude that PFOA exposure was associated with the development of hepatic diseases, more observational studies are needed to confirm its long-term effects. © 2022 by the authors.},

	abstract = {Early childhood caries (ECC) are an oral health problem worldwide in children under 6 years of age. This disease of rapid development has a multifactorial etiology, and one of the possible risk factors is developmental defects of enamel (DDE), such as hypoplasia and opacities. The aim of this systematic review was to evaluate the association between DDE and ECC in children under 6 years of age. An electronic search was conducted until March 2022 using Medline (PubMed), Scopus, Science-Direct, LILACS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, EBSCO-Host, EMBASE, and Google Scholar and complemented with a manual search, with no restrictions on language or date of publication. Longitudinal studies of children under 6 years of age with primary dentition were included. A total of 1158 studies were found, of which 651 records were reviewed by title and abstract, and 24 articles were selected for full-text evaluation. Finally, nine studies that met the selection criteria were included in the qualitative synthesis. Study quality and certainty were assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale and the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) tool. Three cohort studies of good quality were included in the meta-analysis. A risk associated with DDE (RR = 1.94; 95% CI: 1.52–2.49) and a risk associated with enamel hypoplasia (RR = 5.45; 95% CI: 1.84–16.14) were found. The results for diffuse opacity (RR = 1.21; 95% CI: 0.18–8.15) and demarcated opacity (RR = 1.26; 95% CI: 0.43–3.65) were not significant. GRADE analysis presented low and very low certainty of evidence. It was concluded that there is an association between DDE and ECC. However, the results should be interpreted with caution because of the limitations of the study.

	abstract = {Investigation of the toxicity triggered by chemicals on the human brain has traditionally relied on approaches using rodent in vivo models and in vitro cell models including primary neuronal cultures and cell lines from rodents. The issues of species differences between humans and rodents, the animal ethical concerns and the time and cost required for neurotoxicity studies on in vivo animal models, do limit the use of animal-based models in neurotoxicology. In this context, human cell models appear relevant in elucidating cellular and molecular impacts of neurotoxicants and facilitating prioritization of in vivo testing. The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC® CRL-2266™) is one of the most used cell lines in neurosciences, either undifferentiated or differentiated into neuron-like cells. This review presents the characteristics of the SH-SY5Y cell line and proposes the results of a systematic review of literature on the use of this in vitro cell model for neurotoxicity research by focusing on organic environmental pollutants including pesticides, 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), flame retardants, PFASs, parabens, bisphenols, phthalates, and PAHs. Organic environmental pollutants are widely present in the environment and increasingly known to cause clinical neurotoxic effects during fetal & child development and adulthood. Their effects on cultured SH-SY5Y cells include autophagy, cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, or necrosis), increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of neurotransmitter homeostasis, and alteration of neuritic length. Finally, the inherent advantages and limitations of the SH-SY5Y cell model are discussed in the context of chemical testing. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {The relation between pesticides exposure and metabolic syndrome (MetS) has not been clearly identified. Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides exposure and their contaminants. We included 12 studies for a total of 6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1%) had a MetS. Overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk of MetS by 30% (95CI 22%–37%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of MetS by 23% (14–32%), as well as for most types of organochlorines: hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53% (28–78%), hexachlorobenzene by 40% (0.01–80%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene by 22% (9–34%), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28% (5–50%), oxychlordane by 24% (1–47%), and transnonchlor by 35% (19–52%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk by 46% (35–56%) using crude data or by 19% (10–29%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for overall pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36% risk increase, 17–55%) and transnonchlor (25% risk increase, 3–48%) with fully-adjusted models. Metaregressions demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk of MetS in comparison to most other pesticides. The risk increased for more recent periods (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by year). We demonstrated an inverse relationship with body mass index and male gender. In conclusion, pesticides exposure is a major risk factor for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data are lacking for other types of pesticides. The risk increased with time, reflecting a probable increase of the use of pesticides worldwide. The inverse relationship with body mass index may signify a stockage of pesticides and contaminants in fat tissue. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Polyfluoroalkyl phosphate esters (PAPs) can be found throughout society due to their numerous commercial applications. However, they also pose an environmental and health concern given their ability to undergo hydrolysis and oxidation to several bioactive and persistent products, including the perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs). The metabolism of PAPs has been shown to occur in mammalian liver and intestine, however metabolism by the gut microbiome has not yet been investigated. In this study, human fecal samples were used to model the microbial population of the colon, to test whether these anaerobic microbes could facilitate 8:2 monosubstituted PAP (monoPAP) transformation. In vitro testing was completed by incubating the fecal samples with 8:2 monoPAP (400-10,000 nM) up to 120 minutes in an anaerobic chamber. Reactions were then terminated and the samples prepared for GC- and LC-MS/MS analysis. Metabolites of interest were the immediate hydrolysis product, the 8:2 fluorotelomer alcohol (FTOH), and 11 additional metabolites previously shown to form from 8:2 FTOH in both oxic and anoxic environments. The kinetics of 8:2 monoPAP transformation by gut microbiota were compared to those in human S9 liver and intestine fractions, both of which have active levels of hydrolyzing and oxidative enzymes that transform 8:2 monoPAP. Transformation rates from 8:2 monoPAP to 8:2 FTOH were highest in liver S9 > intestine S9 > fecal suspensions. The gut microbiome also produced a unique composition of oxidative metabolites, where the following intermediate metabolites were more abundant than terminal PFCAs: 8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA) > 8:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA) > 7:2 Ketone ≈ perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Hydrolytic and oxidative metabolites contributed up to 30% of the molar balance after microbial 8:2 monoPAP transformation. Together, the results suggest that the gut microbiome can play a notable role in PAP biotransformation. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent, mobile, and toxic chemicals that are hazardous to human health and the environment. Several countries, including the United States, plan to set an enforceable maximum contamination level for certain PFAS compounds in drinking water sources. Among the available treatment options, photocatalytic treatment is promising for PFAS degradation and mineralization in the aqueous solution. In this review, recent advances in the abatement of PFAS from water using photo-oxidation and photo-reduction are systematically reviewed. Degradation mechanisms of PFAS by photo-oxidation involving the holes (hvb+) and oxidative radicals and photo-reduction using the electrons (ecb-) and hydrated electrons (eaq-) are integrated. The recent development of innovative heterogeneous photocatalysts and photolysis systems for enhanced degradation of PFAS is highlighted. Photodegradation mechanisms of alternative compounds, such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), are also critically evaluated. This paper concludes by identifying major knowledge gaps and some of the challenges that lie ahead in the scalability and adaptability issues of photocatalysis for natural water treatment. Development made in photocatalysts design and system optimization forges a path toward sustainable treatment of PFAS-contaminated water through photodegradation technologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Introduction Environmental toxicants such as chemical pollution have an enormous impact on the health of people and the planet. Emerging findings suggest that non-communicable diseases are linked to early and chronic environmental exposures. However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods and analysis A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Ethics and dissemination Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

	abstract = {Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) has gained unparalleled success in the treatment of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, undesired side effects, unsatisfactory response rates, tumor metastasis, and drug resistance still hinder the further application of ICB therapy against CRC. Advancing ICB with nanotechnology can be game-changing. With the development of immuno-oncology and nanomaterials, various nanoplatforms have been fabricated to enhance the efficacy of ICB in CRC treatment. Herein, this review systematically summarizes these recent nano-strategies according to their mechanisms. Despite their diverse and complex designs, these nanoplatforms have four main mechanisms in enhancing ICB: 1) targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to tumor foci, 2) increasing tumor immunogenicity, 3) remodeling tumor microenvironment, and 4) pre-sensitizing immune systems. Importantly, advantages of nanotechnology in CRC, such as innovating the mode-of-actions of ICB, modulating intestinal microbiome, and integrating the whole process of antigen presentation, are highlighted in this review. In general, this review describes the latest applications of nanotechnology for CRC immunotherapy, and may shed light on the future design of ICB platforms.

	abstract = {Companion animals are in close contact with the human surroundings, and there is growing concern about the effects of harmful substances on the health of pet cats. In this study, we investigated the potential health effects of organohalogen compounds (OHCs) on thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis and metabolomics in Japanese pet cats. There was a significant negative correlation between concentrations of several contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and THs in cat serum samples. These results suggested that exposure to OHCs causes a decrease in serum TH levels in pet cats. In this metabolomics study, each exposure level of parent compounds (PCBs and PBDEs) and their hydroxylated compounds (OH-PCBs and OH-PBDEs) were associated with their own unique primary metabolic pathways, suggesting that parent and phenolic compounds exhibit different mechanisms of action and biological effects. PCBs were associated with many metabolic pathways, including glutathione and purine metabolism, and the effects were replicated in in-vivo cat PCB administration studies. These results demonstrated that OHC exposure causes chronic oxidative stress in pet cats. PBDEs were positively associated with alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Due to the chronic exposure of cats to mixtures of these contaminants, the combination of their respective metabolic pathways may have a synergistic effect. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: More than half of adverse drug events in pediatric patients are avoidable and blocking medication errors at the prescribing stage might be one of the most effective preventive measures. Objective: To form a tool (a series of criteria) for detecting potentially inappropriate prescriptions in children, promote clinical rational drug use and reduce risks of medication in children. Methods: Potentially inappropriate prescription propositions for children were collected through a systematic review. Then, the Delphi technique was adopted to form the final criteria. Panelists were asked to use a 5-point Likert scale to rate their agreement with each potentially inappropriate prescription proposition and were encouraged to add new propositions based on their clinical experience and knowledge. After 2 rounds of Delphi survey and propositions were fully revised and improved, the final criteria for identifying potentially inappropriate prescriptions in children were formed. Results: The final criteria for identifying potential inappropriate prescriptions in children has 136 propositions, which were divided into “criteria for children with non-specific diseases/conditions” (71 propositions: 68 for potentially inappropriate medication, 3 for potential prescribing omission) and “criteria for children with specific diseases/conditions” (65 propositions: 55 for potentially inappropriate medication, 10 for potential prescribing omission), according to whether the proposition was about identifying specific risks associated with one drug in children with a specific other diseases/conditions that do not exist in children with other diseases/conditions. Conclusion: A tool for screening potentially inappropriate prescriptions in children is formed to detect potentially inappropriate medication and prescribing omission in pediatrics and is available to all medical professionals liable to prescribe or dispense medicines to children.

This study systematically investigated the comprehensive effects of a typical antibiotic (sulfadimidine, SDM) in livestock and poultry breeding wastewater on the anammox process, with the aim of elucidating the intracellular and extracellular protective mechanisms of the anammox consortia to the antibiotic stress. Results revealed that the high-concentration SDM significantly reduced the specific anammox activity (SAA) by 37.8%. Changes in the abundance of Candidatus Kuenenia showed a similar trend with that of SAA, while other nitrogen-related microorganisms (e.g., Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira) contributed to the nitrogen removal especially during the inhibitory period. Resistance of the anammox consortia to SDM mainly depended on the protection of ARGs and EPS. Network analysis revealed the host range of eARGs was relatively larger than that of iARGs, and intI1 was closely associated with representative denitrifiers. In addition, metaproteomic analysis and molecular docking results indicated that abundant proteins in EPS could detain SDM in the extracellular matrix through forming complex via hydrogen bond. These findings provide a guidance for the stable operation of anammox process and ARGs transfer controlling. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Introduction: The mechanism for human labour remains poorly understood, limiting our ability to manage complications including spontaneous preterm birth and induction of labour (IOL). The study of fetal signals poses specific challenges. Metabolomic analysis of maternal blood, the cord artery (CA), and cord vein (CV), allows simultaneous interrogation of multiple metabolic pathways associated with different modes of labour onset and birth. Methods: Global mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis was performed on serial samples collected from participants during pregnancy, in latent phase of labour, and following birth (CA, CV, and intervillous (IV) blood), from those who spontaneously laboured and birthed vaginally (SL group), had IOL and birthed vaginally (IOL group), or birthed via elective caesarean section (no labour; ECS group). Results: There were clear differences in fetal and maternal steroid, arachidonate and sphingosine pathways between the SL and IOL groups, despite similar uterine contractions and vaginal birth. The CA/CV ratio for key steroids of the IOL group were more alike the ECS group than the SL group, including progesterone (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=3.5; IOL group=0.5; and ECS group=0.5), and oestriol (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=4.3; IOL group=0.4; and for ECS group=0.2). There were no such changes in the maternal samples. Discussion: These findings indicate that IOL does not reproduce the pathways activated in spontaneous labour. The decreased placental progesterone production observed with spontaneous labour may represent a local intrauterine progesterone withdrawal, which, together with other signals, would activate parturition pathways involving arachidonate and sphingosine metabolism. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) used in aqueous film-forming foam (AFFF) comprise some perfluoroalkyl substances but a larger variety of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Despite their abundance in AFFF, information is lacking on the potential transformation of these polyfluoroalkyl substances. Due to the biological and chemical stability of the repeating perfluoroalkyl -(CF2)n- moiety common to all known AFFF-derived PFASs, it is not immediately evident whether the microbial biotransformation mechanisms observed for other organic contaminants also govern the microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Herein, we aim to: 1) review the literature on the aerobic or anaerobic microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental media; 2) compile and summarize proposed microbial biotransformation pathways for major classes of polyfluoroalkyl substances; 3) identify the dominant biotransformation intermediates and terminal biotransformation products; and 4) discuss these findings in the context of environmental monitoring and source allocation. This analysis revealed that much more is currently known about aerobic microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances, as compared to anaerobic biotransformation. Further, there are some similarities in microbial biotransformations of fluorotelomer and electrochemical fluorination-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, but differences may be largely due to head group composition. Dealkylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic reactions appear to be particularly important for microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, and these biotransformations may lead to formation of some semi-stable intermediates. Finally, this review discusses key knowledge gaps and opportunities for further research. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Humans are exposed to several per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) daily; however, most previous studies have focused on individual PFAS. Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures’ effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted. © 2021},

	abstract = {Perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of fluorinated aliphatic compounds considered as emerging persistent pollutants. Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The Chinese government recently proposed ammonia (NH3) emission reductions (but without a specific national target) as a strategic option to mitigate fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution. We combined a meta-analysis of nationwide measurements and air quality modeling to identify efficiency gains by striking a balance between controlling NH3 and acid gas (SO2 and NOx) emissions. We found that PM2.5 concentrations decreased from 2000 to 2019, but annual mean PM2.5 concentrations still exceeded 35 μgm-3 at 74% of 1498 monitoring sites during 2015-2019. The concentration of PM2.5 and its components were significantly higher (16 %-195 %) on hazy days than on non-hazy days. Compared with mean values of other components, this difference was more significant for the secondary inorganic ions SO2-4, NO-3, and NHC4+ (average increase 98 %). While sulfate concentrations significantly decreased over this period, no significant change was observed for nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Model simulations indicate that the effectiveness of a 50% NH3 emission reduction for controlling secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) concentrations decreased from 2010 to 2017 in four megacity clusters of eastern China, simulated for the month of January under fixed meteorological conditions (2010). Although the effectiveness further declined in 2020 for simulations including the natural experiment of substantial reductions in acid gas emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting reductions in SIA concentrations were on average 20.8% lower than those in 2017. In addition, the reduction in SIA concentrations in 2017 was greater for 50% acid gas reductions than for the 50% NH3 emission reductions. Our findings indicate that persistent secondary inorganic aerosol pollution in China is limited by emissions of acid gases, while an additional control of NH3 emissions would become more important as reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions progress.

	abstract = {The identification of xenobiotics in nontargeted metabolomic analyses is a vital step in understanding human exposure. Xenobiotic metabolism, transformation, excretion, and coexistence with other endogenous molecules, however, greatly complicate the interpretation of features detected in nontargeted studies. While mass spectrometry (MS)-based platforms are commonly used in metabolomic measurements, deconvoluting endogenous metabolites from xenobiotics is also often challenged by the lack of xenobiotic parent and metabolite standards as well as the numerous isomers possible for each small molecule m/z feature. Here, we evaluate a xenobiotic structural annotation workflow using ion mobility spectrometry coupled with MS (IMS-MS), mass defect filtering, and machine learning to uncover potential xenobiotic classes and species in large metabolomic feature lists. Xenobiotic classes examined included those of known high toxicities, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and pesticides. Specifically, when the workflow was applied to identify PFAS in the NIST SRM 1957 and 909c human serum samples, it greatly reduced the hundreds of detected liquid chromatography (LC)-IMS-MS features by utilizing both mass defect filtering and m/z versus IMS collision cross sections relationships. These potential PFAS features were then compared to the EPA CompTox entries, and while some matched within specific m/z tolerances, there were still many unknowns illustrating the importance of nontargeted studies for detecting new molecules with known chemical characteristics. Additionally, this workflow can also be utilized to evaluate other xenobiotics and enable more confident annotations from nontargeted studies. © 2022 American Chemical Society. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Background: Systematic evidence maps are increasingly used to develop chemical risk assessments. These maps can provide an overview of available studies and relevant study information to be used for various research objectives and applications. Environmental epidemiological studies that examine the impact of chemical exposures on various ‘omic profiles in human populations provide relevant mechanistic information and can be used for benchmark dose modeling to derive potential human health reference values. Objectives: To create a systematic evidence map of environmental epidemiological studies examining environmental contaminant exposures with ‘omics in order to characterize the extent of available studies for future research needs. Methods: Systematic review methods were used to search and screen the literature and included the use of machine learning methods to facilitate screening studies. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were developed to identify and screen relevant studies. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were summarized with information such as study population, study design, sample size, exposure measurement, and ‘omics analysis. Results: Over 10,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes were used to identify 84 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Various contaminants (e.g. phthalate, benzene, arsenic, etc.) were investigated in epidemiological studies that used one or more of the four ‘omics of interest: epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The epidemiological study designs that were used to explore single or integrated ‘omic research questions with contaminant exposures were cohort studies, controlled trials, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. An interactive web-based systematic evidence map was created to display more study-related information. Conclusions: This systematic evidence map is a novel tool to visually characterize the available environmental epidemiological studies investigating contaminants and biological effects using ‘omics technology and serves as a resource for investigators and allows for a range of applications in chemical research and risk assessment needs. © 2022},

	abstract = {Background: Periurethral injection of bulking agents is a minimally invasive therapeutic option for the treatment of stress urinary incontinence (SUI). Objective: We conducted a literature review on the bulking agents used in the treatment of SUI, their indications and the different techniques of injection. Material and methods: The literature review followed PRISMA guidelines. We used the Mesh terms: urinary, incontinence, and bulking to search the PubMed database, from the date of conception until June 2020. All studies modalities were included and references lists were also reviewed for relevant articles. Our search identified 60 articles published between 2001 and 2020. References lists review allowed the addition of 40 more articles. In total, 54 articles were included in the descriptive analysis. Results: Bulking agents that are used nowadays are the glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine collagen, polydimethylsiloxane, calcium hydroxyapatite, porcine dermal implants, carbon coated zirconium beads, and the polyacrylamide hydrogel. Cure rates of bulking agents are lower compared to surgical management. Periurethral injection was found to be beneficial in patients who refuse or who are inadequate for surgical management, or after the failure of the latter. It can be performed via paraurethral or transurethral routes, with comparable efficacy. Ultrasonic, radiographic or endoscopic assistance allow better precision and control of the procedure. Paraurethral route is associated with bigger injected volumes, higher costs, and more complications. Studies showed superiority of the injections in the mid-urethra, in horseshoe or circumferential template. Conclusion: The identification of optimal bulking agent is difficult. The choice of the agent currently depends on the availability, doctor's preference, cost, and the ease of use. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS; Contexte: L'injection peri-urétrale d'agents comblant est une option thérapeutique peu invasive pour l'incontinence urinaire d'effort (IUE). Objectif: Nous présentons une revue de la littérature à propos des agents comblant dans le traitement de l'IUE, leurs indications et les différentes techniques d'injection. Matériel et méthodes: La revue a été réalisée selon la stratégie PRISMA en utilisant la base de données PubMed et les termes Mesh : « urinary », « incontinence » et « bulking ». Tous les articles publiés en français ou en anglais jusqu’à 29 juin 2020 ont été examinés. Les de toutes modalités ont été incluses et les listes des références ont été étudiées. La recherche a identifié 60 articles publiés entre 2001 et 2020. L’étude des listes des références a identifié 40 articles supplémentaires. Au total, 54 articles ont été retenus pour l’étude descriptive. Résultats: Les matériaux comblant utilisés actuellement sont le collagène réticulé par du glutaraldéhyde, les polymères de silicone, l'hydroxyapatite de calcium, le derme porcin, les billes de zirconium recouverts de carbone et l'hydrogel de polyacrylamide. Ils offrent des taux de guérison inférieurs par rapport à la chirurgie. C'est une alternative attirante pour les patientes qui refusent ou qui ne sont pas candidates aux interventions chirurgicales, ou après échec de ces dernières. Les voies d'injection para-urétrale et transurétrale sont pratiquées avec une efficacité comparable. Un contrôle échographique, radiologique ou endoscopique permet une meilleure précision et contrôle de la procédure. La voie para-urétrale nécessite un volume injectable plus important, avec un coût et un risque de complications supérieurs. L'efficacité des injections paraît supérieure lorsqu'elle est pratiquée en mi-urétral, en forme circonférentielle ou en fer à cheval. Conclusion: L'identification d'un agent optimale est difficile. La sélection de l'agent dépend actuellement de la disponibilité du produit, la préférence du médecin, le coût et la facilité d'utilisation. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS},

	abstract = {Lipids are the main energy support during gametogenesis. Digestive gland is the key organ of aquatic animal metabolism for storing nutrition and supplying energy. It participates in a variety of life activities (such as growth, digestion, immunity, and reproduction). Nutrients stored in digestive glands, especially lipids, provide energy for reproductive behaviors such as gametogenesis and ovulation. A large number of studies have confirmed the accumulation of lipids from digestive gland to gonad during gametogenesis. At present, the research on the interference mechanism of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on lipid metabolism of aquatic animals and the adaptive response of aquatic animals to POPs stress focus on biochemical levels or a few genes. The potential molecular mechanism of lipid metabolism interference needs to be further studied. In addition, as an important stage of aquatic animals, the reproductive period is a vigorous period of lipid metabolism. However, at present, there is no report on the molecular mechanism of POPs interfering with the lipid metabolism of the digestive gland in the reproductive process of aquatic animals. In this study, female scallop C. farreri was cultured in natural seawater and exposed to 4 μg/L B[a]P in seawater. Transcriptome analysis of digestive glands at multiple stages (proliferative stage, growth stage, mature stage and spawn stage) was performed, and iPath pathway analysis was used to analyze lipid metabolism pathways and differential genes. The interference mechanism of lipid metabolism in bivalves during reproductive period was revealed. This study will provide valuable genomic information on the role of digestive glands in lipid metabolism and reproduction of C. farreri, and will contribute to further functional genomics of bivalves and other closely related species. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Emerging pollutants (EPs) create a worldwide concern owing to their low concentration and severe toxicity to the receptors. The prominent emerging pollutants categories as pharmaceutical and personal care product, plasticizer, surfactants, and persistent organic pollutants. Typically, EPs are widely disseminated in the aquatic ecosystem and capable of perturbing the physiology of water bodies as well as humans. The primary sources of EPs in the environment include anthropogenic release, atmospheric deposition, untreated or substandard treated wastewater, and extreme weather events. Intensive research has been done covering the environmental distribution, ecological disturbance, fate, and removal of EPs in the past decades. However, a systematic review on the distribution of EPs in the engineered and natural aquatic environment and the degradation of different EPs by using anaerobic sludge, aerobic bacteria, and isolated strains are limited. This review article aims to highlight the importance, application, and future perceptions of using different microbes to degrade EPs. Overall, this review article illustrates the superiority of using non-cultivable and cultivable microbes to degrade the EPs as an eco-friendly approach. Practically, the outcomes of this review paper will build up the knowledge base solutions to remove EPs from the wastewater. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Existing evidence suggests that perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) exposure might contribute to the incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health. Further studies are needed in order to establish causality and clarify the potential mechanism. © 2021},

	abstract = {Bacteria capable of dehalogenation via reductive or hydrolytic pathways are ubiquitous. Little is known, however, about the prevalence of bacterial dechlorination in deep terrestrial environments with a limited carbon supply. In this study we analyzed published genomes from three deep terrestrial subsurface sites: a deep aquifer in Western Siberia, the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, USA, and the Soudan Underground Iron Mine (SUIM) in Minnesota, USA to determine if there was evidence to suggest that microbial dehalogenation was possible in these environments. Diverse dehalogenase genes were present in all analyzed metagenomes, with reductive dehalogenase and haloalkane dehalogenase genes the most common. Taxonomic analysis of both hydrolytic and reductive dehalogenase genes was performed to explore their affiliation; this analysis indicated that at the SUIM site, hydrolytic dehalogenase genes were taxonomically affiliated with Marinobacter species. Because of this affiliation, experiments were also performed with Marinobacter subterrani strain JG233 ('JG233'), an organism containing three predicted hydrolytic dehalogenase genes and isolated from the SUIM site, to determine whether hydrolytic dehalogenation was an active process and involved in growth on a chlorocarboxylic acid. Presence of these genes in genome appears to be functional, as JG233 was capable of chloroacetate dechlorination with simultaneous chloride release. Stable isotope experiments combined with confocal Raman microspectroscopy demonstrated that JG233 incorporated carbon from 13C-chloroacetate into its biomass. These experiments suggest that organisms present in these extreme and often low-carbon environments are capable of reductive and hydrolytic dechlorination and, based on laboratory experiments, may use this capability as a competitive advantage by utilizing chlorinated organic compounds for growth, either directly or after dechlorination.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Experimental evidence indicates that exposure to certain pollutants is associated with liver damage. Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score = 6.20, p < 0:001), PFOS (z-score = 3.55, p < 0:001), and PFNA (z-score = 2.27, p = 0:023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10092. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

	abstract = {Background: Selective nerve root block has been widely used to treat degenerative disc disease (DDD), but no detailed research data is provided to compare the efficacy of epidural injection of anesthetics with or without steroids on the DDD treatment. Objectives: This study aimed to provide the first comparison of steroids + local anesthetic (LA) or LA alone for the treatment of DDD. Study Design: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the clinical efficacy of both the steroids + LA group and the LA alone group, and subgroup analysis was also adopted. Setting: A systematic review and meta-analysis using a random effects model on randomized controlled studies (RCTs). Methods: After reviewing titles, abstracts, risk of bias, and full texts of 15,889 studies that were chosen following removal of duplicates after the initial database search, finally, 19 RCTs were included. Pain rating, functional score, follow-up period, and other-related data were extracted from these included works, and the effect size and statistical significance were calculated by the random effects model. The quality and level of the derived evidence were assessed by means of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. Results: In terms of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at one year, the combination of steroids + LA was obviously superior to LA. Subgroup analysis suggested that the combination of steroids + LA was more effective than LA alone in regard to the ODI in the lumbar group within 2 years. The opioids intake of patients treated by LA alone was less than that of the steroids + LA group within 3 months, and LA alone was more effective in pain score reduction, with more than 50% within 6 months in the interlaminar injection group. However, the combination of steroids + LA was more effective when alleviating the NRS-11 within 18 months in the caudal injection group. Limitations: Firstly, this analysis was inconsistent in technique, dosage, injection frequency, and follow-up period of epidural injections. Such differences may compromise the reported efficacy. Secondly, adverse reactions arising out of the 2 groups were not examined in that the included RCTs did not provide the data. Thirdly, different injection methods would compromise the outcomes, and no subgroup analysis was performed on different injection methods. Finally, these included articles that were mainly sourced from Manchikanti’s team, and thus biased to some extent. Conclusions: The addition of steroids to anesthetic injectates was associated with a better NRS-11 and ODI compared with LA alone within one year in patients with DDD. Furthermore, the improvement of the ODI was observed within 2 years in patients with lumbar DDD. © 2022, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Emerging pollutants (EPs) are causative for teratogenic and reproductive effects. EPs are detected in all the environmental matrices at higher levels. A suitable model for aquatic toxicity assessment is Hydra, because of morphological, behavioral, reproductive (sexual and asexual), and biochemical changes. Many researchers have used Hydra for toxicity assessment of organic chemicals (BPA), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials and microplastics. Various Hydra species were used for environmental toxicity studies; however H. magnipapillata was predominantly used due to the availability of its genome and proteome sequences. Teratogenic and reproductive changes in Hydra are species specific. Teratogenic effects were studied using sterozoom dissecting microscope, acridine orange (AO) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DPAI) staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by EPs had been understood by the Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFDA) staining and comet assay. Multiple advanced techniques would aid to understand the effects at molecular level, such as real-time PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA end- PCR. EPs modulated the major antioxidant enzyme levels, therefore, defense mechanism was affected by the higher generation of reactive oxygen species. Genome sequencing helps to know the mode of action of pollutants, role of enzymes in detoxification, defense genes and stress responsive genes. Molecular techniques were used to obtain the information for evolutionary changes of genes and modulation of gene expression by EPs. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Seabird species world-wide are integral to both marine and terrestrial environments, connecting the two systems by transporting vast quantities of marine-derived nutrients and pollutants to terrestrial breeding, roosting and nesting grounds via the deposition of guano and other allochthonous inputs (e.g. eggs, feathers). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and provide insight into what types of nutrients and pollutants seabirds are transporting, the influence these subsidies are having on recipient environments, with a particular focus on soil, and what may happen if seabird populations decline. The addition of guano to colony soils increased nutrient levels compared to control soils for all seabirds studied, with cascading positive effects observed across a range of habitats. Deposited guano sometimes led to negative impacts, such as guanotrophication, or guano-induced eutrophication, which was often observed where there was an excess of guano or in areas with high seabird densities. While the literature describing nutrients transported by seabirds is extensive, literature regarding pollutant transfer is comparatively limited, with a focus on toxic and bioaccumulative metals. Research on persistent organic pollutants and plastics transported by seabirds is likely to increase in coming years. Studies were limited geographically, with hotspots of research activity in a few locations, but data were lacking from large regions around the world. Studies were also limited to seabird species listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. As seabird populations are impacted by multiple threats and steep declines have been observed for many species world-wide, gaps in the literature are particularly concerning. The loss of seabirds will impact nutrient cycling at localized levels and potentially on a global scale as well, yet it is unknown what may truly happen to areas that rely on seabirds if these populations disappear. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {The impact of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) on the anaerobic granular sludge was evaluated through a sequential batch experiment. Results showed that PFOA inhibited the chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal rate of the sludge and the dosage of 100 mg/L PFOA was more obvious. However, this negative effect would gradually weaken with the adaptation of microorganisms. For the 50 mg/L PFOA experimental group, the proteins content in the extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) of the anaerobic granular sludge increased from 1.53 mg/g to 3.65 mg/g. Meanwhile, PFOA inhibited the 2-(p-iodophenyl)-3-(p-nitrophenyl)-5-phenyltetrazolium chloride (INT) activity of the anaerobic granular sludge. Furthermore, 100 mg/L PFOA reduced the relative abundance of Proteobacteria by 5.99% and Longilinea by 1.11%. 100 mg/L PFOA mainly restricted COD removal by affecting the glycolysis process, with the abundances of glucokinase and pyruvate kinase reduced by 8% and 28.1%, respectively. Compared with the control group, the relative abundance of the methyl-coenzyme M reductase alpha subunit increased by 84%, respectively, under 100 mg/L PFOA. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Limited information is available regarding chemical water quality at the tap in Guatemala City, preventing individuals, water utilities, and public health authorities from making data-driven decisions related to water quality. To address this need, 113 participants among households served by a range of water providers across the Guatemala City metropolitan area were recruited as participatory scientists to collect first-draw and flushed tap water samples at their residence. Samples were transported to the U.S. and analyzed for 20 metals and 25 per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). At least one metal exceeded the Guatemalan Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) for drinking water in 63% of households (n = 71). Arsenic and lead exceeded the MPL in 33.6% (n = 38) and 8.9% (n = 10) of samples, respectively. Arsenic was strongly associated with groundwater while lead occurrence was not associated with location, water source, or provider. One or more PFAS were detected in 19% of samples (n = 21, range 2.1–64.2 ppt). PFAS were significantly associated with the use of plastic water storage tanks but not with location, water source, or provider. Overall, the high prevalence of arsenic above the MPL in Guatemala City tap water represents a potential health risk that current water treatment processes are not optimized to remove. Furthermore, potential contaminants from premise plumbing and storage, including lead and PFAS, represent additional risks requiring further investigation and public engagement. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Substantial quantity of fish has been imported to Bangladesh without adequate food safety assessment which can pose a serious health risk to local people. This study analyzed the trace metals and organochlorine pesticides residues and the associated human health risk in 33 imported fishes (9 species) from four countries (India, Myanmar, Oman, and United Arab Emirates) collected from three different ports (Benapole, Bhomra, and Chittagong) of Bangladesh with invoice lists from the port authorities. Trace metal concentrations were determined using graphite furnace absorption spectrometry and flame absorption spectrometry. The two organochlorine pesticides (Aldrin and Chlordane) residues were determined by GC–MS and found as below detection level (BDL). The trace metal concentrations (mg/kg-ww) in imported fish samples ranged as As 0.008 to 0.558, Pb 0.004 to 0.070, Cr 0.010 to 0.109, Cd 0.00 to 0.083, Ni 0.011 to 0.059, Co BDL to 0.067, Mn BDL to 0.0780, Fe 1.780 to 10.77, Cu 0.055 to 0.632, and Zn 0.898 to 9.245. Concentrations of As and Cd were higher than the food safety guideline. Considering the source country of imported fishes, fish samples from Oman were mostly contaminated by the trace metals. The estimated daily intake (EDI) was higher for Cr. However, the target hazard quotient (THQ) for individual metal and total THQ for combined metals were lower than 1, indicating no apparent non-carcinogenic health risk for consumers. The cancer risk (CR) was within the acceptable range. But extensive monitoring of these toxic chemicals is needed prior to import these fishes to the country. Given the self-sufficiency in fish production, this study also argues whether Bangladesh needs to import the fishes at all. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

Carbon source and trophic position were calculated by using 13C and 15N stable isotopes, individually, and trophic magnification factors (TMFs) were inferred. Only DDT and its metabolites were quantified in all samples analyzed. The most prominent metabolite was p,pʹ-DDE with mean concentration ranging from the 0.82–33.69 ng g−1 lipid weight. Moreover, the ratio of DDT/DDD + DDE in all the biota samples was less than 1 signifying historical DDT application. Regression of log [ΣDDT] vs TL (trophic level) among all biota species showed a significant correlation, indicating that DDTs are biomagnifying along with the food web of Lake Ziway with an estimated TMF of 2.75.

Therefore, this review deals with comprehensive and recent mechanistic approaches of engineered biochar synthesis and its further application in the field of energy and the environment. Synthesis and activation of engineered biochar via various methods has been deliberated in brief. Furthermore, this review systematically covered the impacts of engineered biochar amendment in the composting process, anaerobic digestion (AD), soil microbial community encouragement, and their enzymatic activities. Finally, this review provided a glimpse of the knowledge gaps and challenges associated with application of engineered biochar in various fields, which needs urgent attention in future research. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFAS) are a large family of widely used synthetic chemicals that are environmentally and biologically persistent and present in most individuals. Chronic PFAS exposure have been linked to increased prostate cancer risk in occupational settings, however, underlying mechanisms have not been interrogated. Herein we examined exposure of normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (SPCs) to 10 nM PFOA or PFOS using serial passage of prostasphere cultures. Exposure to either PFAS for 3–4 weeks increased spheroid numbers and size indicative of elevated stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showed 1) SPC expression of PPARs and RXRs able to mediate PFAS effects, 2) the emergence of a new cell cluster of aberrantly differentiated luminal progenitor cells upon PFOS/PFOA exposure, and 3) enrichment of cancer-associated signaling pathways. Metabolomic analysis of PFAS-exposed prostaspheres revealed increased glycolytic pathways including the Warburg effect as well as strong enrichment of serine and glycine metabolism which may promote a pre-malignant SPC fate. Finally, growth of in vivo xenografts of tumorigenic RWPE-2 human prostate cells, shown to contain cancer stem-like cells, was markedly enhanced by daily PFOS feeding to nude mice hosts. Together, these findings are the first to identify human prostate SPCs as direct PFAS targets with resultant reprogrammed transcriptomes and metabolomes that augment a preneoplastic state and may contribute to an elevated prostate cancer risk with chronic exposures. © 2021},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are mostly formed during the incomplete combustion of organic materials, but their importance and presence in materials science, and astrochemistry has also been proven. These carcinogenic persistent organic pollutants are essential in the formation of combustion generated particles as well. Due to their significant impact on the environment and human health, to understand the formation and growth of PAHs is essential. Therefore, the most important growth mechanisms are reviewed, and presented here from the past four decades (1981–2021) to initiate discussions from a new perspective. Although, the collected and analyzed observations are derived from both experimental, and computational studies, it is neither a systematic nor a comprehensive review. Nevertheless, the mechanisms were divided into three main categories, acetylene additions (e.g. HACA), vinylacetylene additions (HAVA), and radical reactions, and discussed accordingly. © 2021 The Author(s)},

	abstract = {Objective: This study estimated the effect of BMI on circulating metabolites in young adults using a recall-by-genotype study design. Methods: A recall-by-genotype study was implemented in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Samples from 756 participants were selected for untargeted metabolomics analysis based on low versus high genetic liability for higher BMI defined by a genetic risk score (GRS). Regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between BMI GRS group and relative abundance of 973 metabolites. Results: After correction for multiple testing, 29 metabolites were associated with BMI GRS group. Bilirubin was among the most strongly associated metabolites, with reduced levels measured in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.32, 95% CI: −0.46 to −0.18, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.005). This study observed associations between BMI GRS group and the levels of several potentially diet-related metabolites, including hippurate, which had lower mean abundance in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.29, 95% CI: −0.44 to −0.15, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.008). Conclusions: Together with existing literature, these results suggest that a genetic predisposition to higher BMI captures differences in metabolism leading to adiposity gain. In the absence of prospective data, separating these effects from the downstream consequences of weight gain is challenging. © 2022 The Authors.

However, approximately 75% of people living with dementia have not received a formal diagnosis. Hence, they do not have access to treatment and care. Without effective treatment in the foreseeable future, it is essential to focus on modifiable risk factors and early intervention. Central auditory processing is impaired in people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its preclinical stages and may manifest many years before clinical diagnosis. This study systematically reviewed central auditory processing function in AD and its preclinical stages using behavioural central auditory processing tests. Eleven studies met the full inclusion criteria, and seven were included in the meta-analyses. The results revealed that those with mild cognitive impairment perform significantly worse than healthy controls within channel adaptive tests of temporal response (ATTR), time-compressed speech test (TCS), Dichotic Digits Test (DDT), Dichotic Sentence Identification (DSI), Speech in Noise (SPIN), and Synthetic Sentence Identification-Ipsilat-eral Competing Message (SSI-ICM) central auditory processing tests.

	abstract = {Insect-borne diseases, such as malaria, and plant pathogens, like the tobacco mosaic virus, are responsible for human deaths and poor crop yields in communities around the world. The use of insecticides has been one of the major tools in pest control. However, the development of insecticide resistance has been a major problem in the control of insect pest populations that threaten the health of both humans and plants. The overexpression of detoxification genes is thought to be one of the major mechanisms through which pests develop resistance to insecticides. Hundreds of research papers have explored how overexpressed detoxification genes increase the resistance status of insects to an insecticide in recent years. This study is, for the first time, a synthesis of these resistance and gene expression data aimed at (1) setting up an example for the application of meta-analysis in the investigation of the mechanisms of insecticide resistance and (2) seeking to determine if the overexpression detoxification genes are responsible for insecticide resistance in insect pests in general. A strong correlation of increased levels of insecticide resistance has been observed in tested insects with cytochrome P450 (CYP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and esterase gene superfamilies, confirming that the overexpression of detoxification genes is indeed involved in the insecticide resistance through the increased metabolism of insecticides of insects, including medically (e.g., mosquito and housefly) and agriculturally (e.g., planthopper and caterpillar) important insects.

	abstract = {Photocatalysis has been extensively studied due to its potential ability to avoid the excessive use of chemical reagents and reduce the energy consumption by employing solar energy. Moreover, to alleviate the reduction in the membrane permeation selectivity, separation efficiency, and membrane service life caused by the emerging micro-pollutants and membrane fouling, membrane technology is often coupled with microbial, electrochemical, and catalytic processes. However, although physical/chemical cleaning and membrane module replacement can overcome the inherent limitations caused by membrane fouling and other membrane separation processes, high operating costs limit their practical applications. In this review, common preparation methods for TiO2 photocatalytic membranes are described in detail, and the main approaches to enhancing their photocatalytic performance are discussed. More importantly, the mechanism of the TiO2 photocatalytic membrane antifouling process is elucidated, and some applications of photocatalytic membranes in other areas are described. This review systematically outlines future research directions in the field of photocatalytic membrane modification, including metal and non-metal doping, fabrication of heterojunction structures, control over reaction conditions, increase in hydrophilicity, and increase in membrane porosity. © 2021},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a large class of synthetic (man-made) chemicals widely used in consumer products and industrial processes. Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement–only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with ≥21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

	abstract = {In a bid to meet its amino acid requirements, Plasmodium falciparum utilizes falcilysin (in addition to other proteases) to aid in cleaving the host hemoglobin at the polar residues. The dependence of the parasite on the host hemoglobin could lead to increased disease severity in the host. In this study, molecular docking analyses were used to evaluate the binding interactions of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide analogues to P. falciparum falcilysin. The protein databank and the CheBI database were used to find P. falciparum falcilysin and the compounds, respectively. The protein and the collected compounds were imported into PyRx virtual screening software and the docking was initiated. Following that, Discovery Studio was utilized to virtualize the 2D and 3D interactions. The binding energies of 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4"-disulfonate and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4"-disulfonic acid were both more than-10.0 kcal/mol among the phenanthroline analogues while only oleanolic acid and N-ethylsuccinimide-mycothiol conjugate from the dipicolinic acid and N-ethylmaleimide analogues had binding energies of-9.7 and-9.4 kcal/mol respectively. The higher binding energies were attributable to hydrogen bond interactions as well as other interactions between the chemicals and the amino acid residues of the falcilysin. The analogues were shown to be moderately safe in pharmacokinetic investigations and scaled Lipinski's rule of five (RO5). The findings of the study revealed that analogues of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide could serve as potential inhibitors of P. falciparum falcilysin. Thus, the compounds can be used as leads or structural scaffolds in the hunt for new therapeutic candidates against the enzyme. © 2022 Dankani et al.},

	abstract = {Purpose: Recent studies have suggested a lower risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in patients receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The current study aimed to provide an updated and comprehensive assessment of the association between SSRI use and development of HCC. Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational studies published until June 2021. We comprehensively searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase to identify studies comparing SSRIs use with control in relation to the risk of HCC. We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between SSRI use and incident HCC risk using random-effects meta-analysis. A dose–response analysis was conducted to evaluate the HCC risk according to the defined daily dose (DDD) of SSRI use. Results: Eight observational studies, comprising 1,051,096 participants and 22,316 incidences of HCC, examining the association between SSRIs use and HCC risk, were included in the systematic review (adjusted RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.56–0.79; P ≤ 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the magnitude of benefit associated with SSRIs was significantly higher in patients with hepatitis infection (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51–0.95) than the general population (Pheterogeneity = 0.700). The dose–response analysis indicated strong inverse association between cumulative DDD of SSRI and risk of HCC (coefficient: − 0.0030; P = 0.002; R2 = 0.78). Conclusions: The results of this review show that SSRI use was associated with a 34% lower risk of HCC, which tend to be dose dependent. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these observations across the spectrum of chronic liver disease and hepatitis infection. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are persistent pollutants that may cause breast cancer. However, associations between exposure to PFASs and the risk of breast cancer are controversial. We retrieved studies on the association between PFASs—perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluo-rononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)—and breast cancer risk in women from PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were ex-tracted or calculated from provided data. Moreover, subgroup and metaregression analyses were performed to distinguish the potential sources of heterogeneity between studies. Lastly, eight orig-inal studies were included in the meta-analysis. PFOA and PFHxS were positively correlated with breast cancer risk, and the pooled ORs (and 95% CIs) were 1.32 (1.19 and 1.46) and 1.79 (1.51 and 2.11), respectively. PFNA was negatively correlated with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 0.76 (0.6 and 0.96), and PFOS was shown to have no correlation with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 1.01 (0.87 and 1.17). All results were merged in a random-effects model with significant heterogeneities (I2 > 90%, p < 0.001). The results demonstrated that PFASs might be potential risk factors for breast cancer, and the compounds in low exposure levels could have a more harmful impact on human health. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Sediments play a pivotal role in maintaining the aquatic ecological status of rivers. However, the determination of the key toxicants that consider the combined effects of all sediment-related contaminants are still challenging and necessary for an appropriate sediment risk assessment. The effects of sediments on aquatic organisms have been reported in Liaohe River, but their key toxicity factors are not well known. To determine the key toxicity factors, twenty-six surface sediment samples from Liaohe River tributaries in Northeast China were collected. Acute toxicity test of midge larvae results showed that 6 of 26 tributaries had obvious toxic effects, with survival rates of 37%–57% (p < 0.05). The masking test showed that the main pollutants in the surface sediments of T7 and T16 were metals, that of T8 was an organic pollutant, those of T19 and T26 were organic pollutants and ammonia, and those of T17 were heavy metal and ammonia. Chemical analysis showed that the relatively high concentrations of ammonia were only presented in surface sediments of T17, T19, and T26, with PTU of 1.5, 1.2 and 1.1, respectively, whereas heavy metals were markedly high in surface sediments from T7 and T16, with PTU of 0.92 and 0.61, respectively. Interestingly, the observed toxicity in surface sediments agreed with the toxicity predicted by chemical analysis Moreover, the significant correlation between the survival and volume ratio of the sediment and overlying water confirmed ammonia nitrogen was key toxicity factor in T17, T19, and T26, whereas Cu was the key toxicity factor in T7 that cause the biological toxicity. In conclusion, the major toxic factors of ammonia and copper in the sediments were identified. Moreover, our study suggested that effect guidance strategy was an effective method for sediment quality assessment. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: In recent years, studies have shown that exposure to environmental pollutants (e.g., radiation, heavy metal substances, air pollutants, organic pollutants) is a leading cause of human non-communicable diseases. The key to disease prevention is to clarify the harmful mechanisms and toxic effects of environmental pollutants on the body. Metabolomics is a high-sensitivity, high-throughput omics technology that can obtain detailed metabolite information of an organism. It is a crucial tool for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the pathway network regulation mechanism of the organism. Its application is widespread in many research fields such as environmental exposure assessment, medicine, systems biology, and biomarker discovery. Aim of review: Recent findings show that metabolomics can be used to obtain molecular snapshots of organisms after environmental exposure, to help understand the interaction between environmental exposure and organisms, and to identify potential biomarkers and biological mechanisms. Key scientific concepts of review: This review focuses on the application of metabolomics to understand the biological effects of radiation, heavy metals, air pollution, and persistent organic pollutants exposure, and examines some potential biomarkers and toxicity mechanisms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Purpose of Review: Surgical mesh is now commonplace among many urogynecologic procedures. Post-surgical imaging of mesh is useful when complications including mesh erosion, bleeding, and chronic pain arise. Different types of mesh coated with various materials have been developed to improve visibility on imaging studies. However, localization of surgical mesh after implantation remains challenging as visualization with standard imaging is difficult. The purpose of this study was to review the various radiologic approaches to characterizing synthetic surgical meshes. Recent Findings: A systematic and comprehensive literature search was performed by two independent reviewers using the PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine to identify all potentially relevant publications published before April 2020. Studies assessing the use of imaging for surgical mesh in both urogynecologic and non-urogyneocologic procedures were included. Iron impregnated mesh was most visible on imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Impregnated mesh was also shown to be more readily visible on ultrasound when compared to its non-iron containing counterpart. Non-impregnated expanded polytetrafluorethylene mesh (EPTF Mesh) was visible on CT and MRI. The more commonly used polypropylene and polyvinylidene mesh were more readily visualized on ultrasound although localization of surrounding structures remains difficult. Summary: Imaging surgical mesh poses an ongoing problem when complications arise. Although particle impregnated mesh is visible on CT and MRI, the adoption of this practice is still in its infancy. The ability to visualize EPTF mesh on CT and MRI is a promising advancement, but proper visualization of the more common synthetic meshes remains a limitation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {The use of agricultural pesticides for agricultural production has led to increase in environmental pollution. Use of pesticides and fertilizers has led to increase in organochlorine pesticides residue concentration and heavy metals. This research is important due to fact that organochlorine pesticides have high resistance to chemical and biological degradation. This study, the trace metals and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) residue in vegetables sold in Iwo market were evaluated. Five types of vegetables were used in this study. Gas chromatograph-electron capture detector (GC-ECD) and atomic absorption spectrophotometry (AAS) were employed in quantitative analysis. Trace metals analysis revealed that Cd and Cr and were not detected in all the samples, while Pb, Cu, Mn and Zn were above WHO/ FAO limit for food samples. Residues of organochlorine were detected in all the vegetable samples except onions. Fifteen isomers of OCPs were detected at varying concentrations. The total burden of OCPs in the samples was in the following order: Ginger˃ Carrot˃ Cabbage˃ Garlic. Total metal burden of the vegetables in decreasing order of Cabbage ˃ Garlic ˃ Carrot ˃ Onion ˃ Ginger. Human exposure to accumulated concentration of OCPs and heavy metals in food via food consumption can be related to several neurological developmental disorder, infertility, reproductive and immune system disorders. © 2021, Islamic Azad University (IAU).},

	abstract = {To examine the diversity and function of the bacterial community in the reservoirs at the middle part of Northern Tianshan Mountain, Moguhu reservoirs (MGW), Kuitun/Chepaizi reservoirs (KCW), Anjihai reservoirs (AJW), and Bayi reservoirs (BYW) were selected as the typical reservoirs for metagenomics analysis. The surface water samples of the reservoirs were collected at multiple points, the bacteria in the water samples were collected by centrifugation. The bacterial DNAs were extracted by CTAB method, the V3-V4 regions were amplified with bacterial 16S rDNA universal primer followed by high-throughput sequencing. The software and online tools including BLAST, USEARCH and QIIME were used to analyze the bacterial diversity, and the functional gene compositions were predicted using PICRUSt software and KEGG database. The results showed that the bacteria from the four reservoirs belonged to 18 phyla, 38 classes and 181 genera, the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) number and diversity index of AJW was higher. There was something in common in the bacterial community compositions of the four reservoirs. The Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria at the phylum level, Flavobacteria was the dominant bacteria at the class level, and Flavobacterium was the dominant bacteria at the genus level. However, there were great differences in the bacterial community compositions of the four reservoirs. In Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria showed a higher relative abundance in MGW and BYW, and Alphaproteobacterial and Betaproteobacteria showed a higher relative abundance in AJW and KCW, respectively; Bacillus exhibited a higher relative abundance in AJW and MGW; other bacteria with higher abundance included Planomicrobium in AJW, Massilia in KCW, Acinetobacter and Planomicrobium in MGW, and Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter in BYW; in addition, some specific high- abundance classes and genera were found in AJW, among them, both Exiguobacterium and CL500-29_marine_group were conducive to maintaining the water quality and bacterial diversity. PICRUSt function prediction analysis indicated that the genes of the bacterial community in four reservoirs related to metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing and cellular processes showed relatively a high abundance. In addition, some bacterial genes were related to the biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds, and the relative abundances of genes related to degradation of benzoate, aminobenzoate, chloroalkane and chloroalkene, and naphthalene were higher. In summary, the compositions of the bacterial community in different reservoirs were varied, which could be related to the water source, surrounding environment, and human activities. The presence of the genes related to the degradation of aromatic compounds and organochlorine compounds in the reservoirs could play a potential role in pollutant degradation and bioremediation. © 2022 Science Press.

	abstract = {Objectives: Initiatives to curb hospital antibiotic use might be associated with harm from under-treatment. We examined the extent to which variation in hospital antibiotic prescribing is associated with mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Methods: This ecological analysis examined Hospital Episode Statistics from 36,124,372 acute/general medicine admissions (≥16y) to 135 acute hospitals in England, 01/April/2010–31/March/2017. Random-effects meta-regression was used to investigate whether heterogeneity in adjusted 30-day mortality was associated with hospital-level antibiotic use, measured in defined-daily-doses (DDD)/1,000 bed-days. Models also considered DDDs/1,000 admissions and DDDs for narrow-spectrum/broad-spectrum antibiotics, parenteral/oral, and local interpretations of World Health Organization Access, Watch, and Reserve antibiotics. Results: Hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days varied 15-fold with comparable variation in broad-spectrum, parenteral, and Reserve antibiotic use. After extensive adjusting for hospital case-mix, the probability of 30-day mortality changed -0.010% (95% CI: -0.064,+0.044) for each increase of 500 hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days. Analyses of other metrics of antibiotic use showed no consistent association with mortality risk. Conclusions: We found no evidence that wide variation in hospital antibiotic use is associated with adjusted mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Using low-prescribing hospitals as benchmarks could help drive safe and substantial reductions in antibiotic consumption of up-to one-third in this population. © 2021},

	abstract = {Environmental antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are a type of emerging pollutant that has been widely concerning. However, investigations into the contamination of ARGs in mining areas have been scarce. Here, the types, abundances, and influencing factors of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were investigated in soil/sediment of the Dexing copper mine area in June 2019 by using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HT-qPCR). Furthermore, the influence of heavy metals and MGEs factors on ARGs was studied using the multivariate statistical analysis method. The results showed that there were a variety of ARGs in the Dexing copper mining area, and the maximum detected number of ARGs was 70. At the relative abundance level, the relative abundance of individual sites reached 0.085. In the Dexing copper mine, multidrug, MLSB, β-lactamases, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the dominant ARG classes based on their numbers. The efflux pump was the most dominant resistance mechanism, followed by antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection. There was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of ARGs and MGEs (P<0.05), and TnpA04 and Inti1 were the most important MEGs in Dexing copper mine samples, indicating that horizontal gene transfer might be an important mechanism for the spread of environmental ARGs. The results of Pearson correlation analysis and RDA analysis showed that the content of Cu was significantly positively correlated with the detected numbers and abundance of ARGs (P<0.05), suggesting that the high content of Cu in the Dexing copper mining area might be an important driving factor for the formation of ARGs. © 2022, Science Press.

	abstract = {Endosulfan remains as a lipophilic insecticide that causes serious medical problems because of biological stability and toxicity also found in air, water, soil sediments, and foodstuffs. Henceforward, the present study reveals a novel bacterial species isolated from pesticide-contaminated soil for enhanced endosulfan degradation. Next, isolated bacterial species was characterized with biochemical assays and 16S rRNA sequencing technique. Subsequently, the optimal conditions for endosulfan biodegradation such as pH, concentration of endosulfan, and bacterial growth were estimated with non-sulfur medium (NSM). Sequentially, the amount of endosulfan and compound degradation were analyzed through thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Overall, the obtained results revealed the endosulfan acting as primary carbon source for bacterial growth. From the GC-MS analysis, the metabolic products released during endosulfan degradation by Pseudomonas sp. MSCAS BT01 were compared with standard GC-MS spectra. The highest (98%) endosulfan degradation was obtained at pH 7.0. The complete endosulfan degradation was achieved at 14th day of incubation and the less toxic endosulfan diol produced was observed via GC-MS. To conclude, the pesticide-contaminated isolate Pseudomonas sp. MSCAS BT01 emerged as a promising bioremediation tool and effectively employed to degrade endosulfan from contaminated soils, sediments, and wastewaters in the days yet to come. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.},

Up to this date, many papers pointed out the challenges and limitations of conventional wastewater treatment and of some advanced oxidation processes. Advanced technologies based on the use of non-equilibrium or non-thermal plasma had been recognized as a possible solution for, not only degradation, but for complete removal of recalcitrant organic micropollutants. While previous review papers have been focused on plasma physics and chemistry of different types of discharges for few organic micropollutants, this paper brings comprehensive review of current knowledge on the chemistry and degradation pathways by using different non-thermal plasma types for several micropollutants’ classes, such as pharmaceuticals, perfluorinated compounds, pesticides, phenols and dyes and points out some major research gaps. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Endocrine disruptors (EDs) are chemical substances that interfere with the endocrine system, adversely affecting human health and environment. Legislation with aim to eliminate and ban EDs have been introduced in EU, but the identification of EDs remains challenging and crucial step towards regulation and risk management. A guidance for ED assessment has been recently established for pesticides and biocides in the EU, which heavily relies on traditional toxicological testing in vivo. Most notably lacking mechanistic methods for some ED modalities and not covering many other modalities that might be affected by EDs. In this project, we focus on the ED assessment according to the valid legislation and explore the possibility to employ alternative methods to bolster the mechanistic understanding of the ED effects and eventually decrease the need for in vivo testing. We selected a well-studied industrial chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to be a model compound in a case study for ED assessment where the EU criteria were applied in the frame of human health risk assessment with focus on thyroid disruption and developmental neurotoxicity. A systematic literature review has been conducted for these effects (Scopus, Pubmed, Embase), and relevant studies were selected by title/abstract screening (RAYYAN) and full-text examination. Selected studies were assessed for reliability (SciRAP), and all relevant data were extracted into a database and assessed by Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach. The initial analysis showed potential endocrine adverse effects and endocrine activity, meeting the ED criteria. The use of mechanistic and alternative methods enhanced the outcomes of WoE assessment. Also, the study provides a great hands-on experience with the most up-to-date development in the area of risk assessment and EDs. © 2022 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

	abstract = {Soil pollution has become an important environmental issue worldwide. Various pollutants in soils may harm human health through the food chain. At present, the commonly used remediated methods mainly include thermal treatment, electrokinetic remediation, stabilization/solidification, soil washing, and bioremediation. Among them, ball milling is a non-combustion technology with simple operation, green, and mild reaction conditions as well as wide applicability, and it is promising in the decontamination of soil pollutants. Ball milling techniques have been gradually used for the detoxification of persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals in contaminated soils, while related reviews focusing on ball milling for soil remediation are limited. It is necessary to fully understand the potential and applied value of ball milling for remediation of contaminated soils. Ball milling has different effects and mechanisms for different pollutants and soil types. Therefore, there is a need to systematically review and digest the relevant knowledge on ball milling remediation of contaminated soils. In this review, the main types of ball milling and influencing factors are summarized, and the mechanisms of ball milling for soil remediation are analyzed. Finally, the problems which need to be solved are briefly described and the future research direction and trend are pointed out. This review is expected to promote the application and its in-depth research of ball milling technology on soil remediation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Using earthworms to remove soil organic pollutants is a common bioremediation method. However, it remains challenging to evaluate and predict their effect on removing soil organic pollutants based on earthworm toxicology and pollutant degradation rates. Peer-reviewed journal articles on ecotoxicology and bioremediation from the years 1974–2020 (cutoff date September 2020) were selected for meta-analysis to quantify the effect size of earthworms on organic pollutant degradation. The meta-analysis shows that the average effect size of earthworms on organic pollutant degradation is 128.5% (p < 0.05). Soils with high soil organic matter or clay textures are more conducive to earthworm-mediated removal of organic pollutants. Structural equation modeling reveals that earthworms’ sensitivity to contaminant exposure may be a greater limiting factor on pollutant degradation than environmental factors. In addition, the quantitative relationship existed between LC50 and the pollutants’ degradation that an elevated LC50 threshold resulted in at least 1.5 times increase in the pollutants’ degradation size. This correlation was dually confirmed via meta-analysis and the validation trial. The results of this study contribute to a more profound understanding of the potential to use earthworms to mitigate organic pollution in soils and develop earthworm-based soil remediation techniques on a global scale. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The excessive use of pesticides is posing major threats to humans and the environment. However, the environmental exposure and impact of pesticides in Pakistan have yet been systematically reviewed, despite the country’s leading role in pesticide use. Therefore, this study identified and then reviewed 85 peer-reviewed scientific publications on the topic. It was found that, compared to the worldwide average, Pakistan had high consumptions of pesticides, with an alarming increase of 1169% in the last two decades. The quantities of pesticides used followed an order of pyrethroids > organophosphates > organochlorines > carbamates, but organochlorines were the most problematic due to their environmental occurrence, the ability to transport across the media, and identified human and ecological toxicities. Additionally, the misuse or overuse of pesticides by farmers is prevailing due to insufficient knowledge about the risks, which leads to high risks in occupational exposure. These issues are further aggravated by the illegal use or continuous impacts of banned organochlorine pesticides. For the future, we suggested the establishment of organized monitoring, assessment, and reporting program based on environmental laws to minimize contamination and exposure to pesticides in Pakistan. Remediation of the contaminated areas to mitigate the adverse environmental-cum-health impacts are recommended in the most affected regions. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), one of the well-known perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), has been widespread in the environment and associated with male reproductive toxicity. However, the molecular mechanism involved in low-level PFOA-induced male endocrine disruption remains to be elucidated. In this study, we performed a combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis to investigate the proteomic and metabolic alterations in MLTC-1 Leydig cells responsive to low levels of PFOA exposure. The results showed that PFOA significantly regulated the expressions of 67 proteins and 17 metabolites, among which 18 proteins and 7 metabolites were specifically tied to lipid and fatty acid metabolism as well as testicular steroidogenesis. It is further suggested that low-dose PFOA stimulates steroid hormone synthesis by accelerating fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenic process, which is involved in the repression of p38 and cAMP-dependent ERK signaling pathway. The animal studies also revealed that environmentally relevant levels of PFOA increased serum steroid hormone levels accompanied by the activated cAMP and inhibited p38/ERK pathway in testis, which confirmed our in vitro findings. Overall, the present study will provide novel insights into the toxicological mechanisms of low-level PFOA-mediated steroidogenic disturbance, and may implicate the reproductive health risk of humans with environmental PFOA exposure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Both Patellofemoral Arthroplasty (PFA) and Total Knee Arthroplasty (TKA) are accepted surgical options for end-stage isolated patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA). We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of PFA and TKA by evaluation of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: We systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Meta-analysis software was used to screen for potential articles with at least two years’ follow-up. Data were extracted and analysed for all PROMs operating time, postoperative inpatient time, complications and cost. We included five studies in our cumulative meta-analysis and reviewed them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used random-effect models. Results: No significant difference was found between both TKA and PFA in the context of operating time. No significant difference after five years’ follow-up was found between the two treatment options in terms of UCLA score and patient satisfaction. PFA showed significant improvement in WOMAC score at five-year follow-up, less postoperative inpatient time, better cost-effectiveness and significantly less blood loss. Conclusion: PFA seems to be a viable alternative to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. PFA showed less postoperative inpatient time and blood loss with similar PROMs to the TKA. Moreover, it is an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Background: Widespread environmental contamination can directly interact with human immune system functions. Environmental effects on the immune system may influence human susceptibility to respiratory infections as well as the severity of infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the efficacy of vaccines to respiratory diseases may be impacted by environmental exposures through immune perturbations. Given the quick pace of research about COVID-19 and associated risk factors, it is critical to identify and curate the streams of evidence quickly and effectively. Objective: We developed this systematic evidence map protocol to identify and organize existing human and animal literature on high-priority environmental chemical classes (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, pesticides, phthalates, quaternary ammonium compounds, and air pollutants) and their potential to influence three key outcomes: (1) susceptibility to respiratory infection, including SARS-CoV-2 (2) severity of the resultant disease progression, and (3) impact on vaccine efficacy. The result of this project will be an online, interactive database which will show what evidence is currently available between involuntary exposures to select environmental chemicals and immune health effects, data gaps that require further research, and data rich areas that may support further analysis. Search and study eligibility: We will search PubMed for epidemiological or toxicological literature on select toxicants from each of the chemical classes and each of the three outcomes listed above. Study appraisal and synthesis of methods: For each study, two independent reviewers will conduct title and abstract screening as well as full text review for data extraction of study characteristics. Study quality will not be evaluated in this evidence mapping. The main findings from the systematic evidence map will be visualized using a publicly available and interactive database hosted on Tableau Public. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Background: A large body of emerging evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) affect birth outcomes in various pathways, but the evidence is inconsistent. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. Results: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from −181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = −360.620 to −1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to −24.252 g (95% CI = −38.574 to −9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be “moderate”. Conclusion: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and fully considering the possible confounders.

Thus, the current study aimed to summarize and discuss the literature on the interactions and ecotoxicity of MP/NPs with pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. A scientometric and systematic review was conducted, and the data were summarized and discussed. The historical analysis indicated that the first article on the interactive effects between MP/NPs and pharmaceuticals was published in 2016. Scientific production is emerging in fourteen countries. Several types of MP/NPs (n = 13) and pharmaceuticals (n = 65) were studied, while the toxicity was evaluated in 30 articles (37.04 %). The interaction of MP/NPs with several pharmaceutical groups was confirmed, mainly antibiotics. In general, results confirmed the Trojan horse effects and indicated that MP/NPs changed the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals. The data reviewed demonstrated that future studies under environmentally relevant conditions are necessary for a better understanding of the mechanisms of action and toxicity of pharmaceuticals adsorbed to MP/NPs, especially mixtures with NPs. This study confirms that MP/NPs can alter the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals in aquatic organisms, indicating their potential toxicological risk. © 2022},

	abstract = {Exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may lead to dysregulated inflammatory responses, however, the detailed relationship between different EDCs and inflammation remains unclear. A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between four types of EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates (PAEs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) and markers of inflammation and immune responses in humans. Three databases were searched, and 36 studies with a total of 22055 participants were included. The associations between EDCs and 26 inflammation-related acute phase proteins and cytokines were analyzed. The results demonstrated that exposure to BPA was positively associated with circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6. Exposure to PAEs was associated with elevated levels of CRP, IL-6 and IL-10. Subgroup analysis found that three PAE metabolites mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were directly associated with a higher level of CRP, and two other PAE metabolites mono-carboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP) and mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) were positively associated with IL-6. The positive associations between PAEs and CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significant in the high-molecular-weight phthalate (HMWP) exposure group, not the low-molecular-weight phthalate (LMWP) exposure group. Exposure to OCPs was positively associated with CRP, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-10. No significant association was found between PCBs and inflammatory markers. These findings demonstrate that exposure to EDCs is closely linked to dysregulated inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted in the future to get a comprehensive view of the associations between different EDCs and inflammation, and investigations on the underlying mechanisms are needed. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) are emerging environmental pollutants that are increasingly being used in consumer commodities. The adverse effects on biota induced by tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) have become a growing concern. Unfortunately, toxic mechanisms at the molecular level for OPFRs in organisms are still lacking. Herein, Escherichia coli (E.coli) was exposed to TCEP and TPHP for 24 and 48 h to reveal oxidative stress response and molecular toxicity mechanisms. The results indicated that promotion of ROS overload occurred at higher dosages groups. The levels of SOD and CAT were significantly elevated along with the increase of MDA attributed to lipid peroxidation. Additionally, apoptosis rates increased, accompanied by a decline in membrane potential and Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase contents, signifying that E. coli cytotoxicity induced by TCEP and TPHP was mediated by oxidative stress. Based on metabolomic analysis, different metabolic pathways were disrupted, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate metabolism, purine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, butanoate metabolism, alanine and aspartate metabolism. Most differentially expressed metabolites were downregulated, indicating an inhibitory effect on metabolic functions and key metabolic pathways. These findings generated new insights into the potential environmental risks of OPFRs in aquatic organisms. © 2021},

	abstract = {Pesticides reach aquatic ecosystems and interact with various targets in cells of fish and other living organisms. Toxicity originates during the metabolization process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult) influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA), an alternative to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), has been detected in various environmental and human matrices. However, information regarding its toxicity remains limited. Here, we established a three-dimensional (3D) primary mouse liver spheroid model to compare the hepatotoxicity of HFPO-TA and PFOA. The 3D spheroids were repeatedly exposed to 25-, 50-, or 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA for 28 d. Compared with the PFOA groups, the HFPO-TA groups showed higher bioaccumulation potential, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP), albumin, and urea secretion. Transcriptome analysis identified 1603 and 772 differentially expressed genes in the 100-μM HFPO-TA- and PFOA-treated groups, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and inflammatory response were significantly altered. Exposure to 100-μM HFPO-TA increased triglyceride content but decreased total cholesterol content, while no changes were observed in the 100-μM PFOA-treated group. Total bile acids in the re-polarized 3D spheroids increased significantly after 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA treatment, which did not affect bile acid synthesis but inhibited the expression levels of Bsep and Mrp2 related to bile acid transport. Thus, HFPO-TA exhibited more serious hepatotoxicity than PFOA in 3D primary liver spheroids and may not be a safe alternative. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

It is a promising impurity adsorption material, which has potential application value in the agricultural environment fields such as soil improvement and sewage purification. The composite can combine the advantages of biochar with chitosan, and the resulting composite usually exhibits a great improvement in its surface functional groups, adsorption sites, stability, and adsorption properties. In addition, compared to other adsorbents, the composite truly achieves the concept of “waste control by waste”. In this paper, the preparation method, composite classification, adsorption mechanism, and models of biochar modified by chitosan are introduced, meanwhile, we also review and summarize their effects on the decontamination of wastewater and soil. In addition to common heavy metal ions, we also review the adsorption and removal of some other organic/inorganic pollutants, including (1) drug residues; (2) dyes; (3) phosphates; (4) radionuclides; (5) perfluorochemicals, etc. Moreover, challenges and prospects for the composite are presented and further studies are called for the chitosan-biochar composite. We believe that the composite will lead to further achievements in the field of environmental remediation. © 2022},

	abstract = {Human ingestion of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) from contaminated food and water is linked to the development of several cancers, birth defects and other illnesses. The complete mineralisation of aqueous PFAS by ultrasound (sonolysis) into harmless inorganics has been demonstrated in many studies. However, the range and interconnected nature of reaction parameters (frequency, power, temperature etc.), and variety of reaction metrics used, limits understanding of degradation mechanisms and parametric trends. This work summarises the state-of-the-art for PFAS sonolysis, considering reaction mechanisms, kinetics, intermediates, products, rate limiting steps, reactant and product measurement techniques, and effects of co-contaminants. The meta-analysis showed that mid-high frequency (100 – 1,000 kHz) sonolysis mechanisms are similar, regardless of reaction conditions, while the low frequency (20 – 100 kHz) mechanisms are specific to oxidative species added, less well understood, and generally slower than mid-high frequency mechanisms. Arguments suggest that PFAS degradation occurs via adsorption (not absorption) at the bubble interface, followed by headgroup cleavage. Further mechanistic steps toward mineralisation remain to be proven. For the first time, complete stoichiometric reaction equations are derived for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) sonolysis, which add H2 as a reaction product and consider CO an intermediate. Fluorinated intermediate products are derived for common, and more novel PFAS, and a naming system proposed for novel perfluoroether carboxylates. The meta-analysis also revealed the transition between pseudo first and zero order PFOA/S kinetics commonly occurs at 15 – 40 µM. Optimum values of; ultrasonic frequency (300 – 500 kHz), concentration (>15 – 40 μM), temperature (≈20 °C), and pH range (3.2 – 4) for rapid PFOX degradation are derived by evaluation of prior works, while optimum values for the dilution factor applied to PFAS containing firefighting foams and applied power require further work. Rate limiting steps are debated and F− is shown to be rate enhancing, while SO42− and CO2 by products are theorised to be rate limiting. Sonolysis was compared to other PFAS destructive technologies and shown to be the only treatment which fully mineralises PFAS, degrades different PFAS in order of decreasing hydrophobicity, is parametrically well studied, and has low-moderate energy requirements (several kWh g−1 PFAS). It is concluded that sonolysis of PFAS in environmental samples would be well incorporated within a treatment train for improved efficiency. © 2022 The Authors},

	abstract = {Development of the Greater Bay area, China (GBA) has imposed significant pressures on ecosystems within the wider Pearl River Delta (PRD) system, including through inputs of contaminants from the GBA's rapidly expanding urban, industrial and agricultural activities. Here, we assess publication trends, sampling focus, and concentrations observed for a range of emerging contaminants (pharmaceutical and personal care products, pesticides, other endocrine disrupting chemicals, platinum group elements, and microplastics) in the GBA, via a systematic review of papers (n = 407) indexed in Science Direct, SpringerLink and Wiley Online databases. While emerging contaminants form the focus of increasing numbers of publications since 2006, they are understudied compared to more traditionally-measured contaminants (here, DDT and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). BisphenolA was the most widely studied of the emerging contaminants (n = 41 studies) in the GBA, followed by macrolides (n = 32 studies). While multiple point measurements with high precision and low detection limits have been reported for various emerging contaminants, these have not been integrated for management purposes. A relatively high percentage of studies present data from single deployments (48% of studies, despite strong seasonality in the PRD system), data coverage is variable spatially, and reported contaminant concentrations vary significantly (over one to four orders of magnitude). We assess the currently published knowledge under the Source-Pathway-Receptor contaminant linkage model and use this to identify (a) current research emphasis in relation to assessment of contaminant risk, and (b) key knowledge gaps around sources, pathways and receptors in the GBA system. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs) are an emerging pollutant in the aquatic environment, and this has gradually been recognized in the Asian region. This systematic review study, using the Scopus da-tabase, provides an insightful understanding of the spatial distribution of scientific studies on MPs in freshwater conducted across the Asian region, utilized sampling methods, and a detailed assessment of the effects of MPs on different biotic components in freshwater ecosystems, with special focus on its potential risks on human health. The results of this review indicate that research on microplastics in Asia has gained attention since 2014, with a significant increase in the number of studies in 2018, and the number of scientific studies quadrupled in 2021 compared to 2018. Results indicated that despite a significant amount of research has been conducted in many Asian countries, they were not distributed evenly, as multiple studies selected specific rivers and lakes. Additionally, around two-thirds of all the papers focused their studies in China, followed by India and South Korea. It was also found that most of the studies focused primarily on reporting the occurrence levels of MPs in freshwater systems, such as water and sediments, and aquatic organisms, with a lack of studies investigating the human intake of MPs and their potential risks to human health. Notably, comparing the results is a challenge because diverse sampling, separation, and identification methods were applied to estimate MPs. This review study suggests that further research on the dynamics and transport of microplastics in biota and humans is needed, as Asia is a major consumer of seafood products and contributes significantly to the generation of plastic litter in the marine environment. Moreover, this review study revealed that only a few studies extended their discus-sions to policies and governance aspects of MPs. This implies the need for further research on policy and governance frameworks to address this emerging water pollutant more holistically. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Hexafluoropropylene oxide trimer acid (HFPO-TA) is reported to have hepatotoxicity, lipotoxicity, and cytotoxicity. In this study, the toxicological effects of HFPO-TA on mitochondrial function and biogenesis were studied. Mice were exposed to drinking water which contained either 2, 20, or 200 μg/L HFPO-TA. Results showed exposure to HFPO-TA induced disadvantageous physiological changes in mice, including increases in liver weight, altered cell morphology, and inflammatory responses. Specifically, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA increased mitochondria number, relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and mRNA levels of mitochondrial genes encoded by mtDNA. Significant increases in TFAM mRNA and protein levels were also observed. Liver metabolome analysis also showed exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA further enhanced increases in metabolites and altered metabolic pathways that correlated with mitochondrial function, especially the production of ATP. HFPO-TA exposure increased protein expression of mitochondrial complex I-V, and the activities of key enzymes involved in TCA cycle (α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase). Furthermore, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA significantly up-regulating mRNA and protein levels of Opa1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Fis1, and Mff, but did not change Drp1. These findings suggest HFPO-TA could have detrimental effects on health of animals, particularly it was associated with disrupted mitochondrial energy metabolism. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Exposure to the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) has been associated with increased risk of Alzheimer s disease (AD), a disease also associated with hyperphosphorylated tau (p-tau) protein aggregation. We investigated whether exposure to DDT can exacerbate tau protein toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans using a transgenic strain that expresses human tau protein prone to aggregation by measuring changes in size, swim behavior, respiration, lifespan, learning, and metabolism. In addition, we examined the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau protein—as a marker of postmortem tau burden—and global metabolism in both a human population study and in C. elegans, using the same p-tau transgenic strain. From the human population study, plasma and CSFderived metabolic features associated with p-tau levels were related to drug, amino acid, fatty acid, and mitochondrial metabolism pathways. A total of five metabolites overlapped between plasma and C. elegans, and four between CSF and C. elegans. DDT exacerbated the inhibitory effect of p-tau protein on growth and basal respiration. In the presence of p-tau protein, DDT induced more curling and was associated with reduced levels of amino acids but increased levels of uric acid and adenosylselenohomocysteine. Our findings in C. elegans indicate that DDT exposure and p-tau aggregation both inhibit mitochondrial function and DDT exposure can exacerbate the mitochondrial inhibitory effects of p-tau aggregation. Further, biological pathways associated with exposure to DDT and p-tau protein appear to be conserved between species.  © The Author(s) 2022.

	abstract = {This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the performance of atrial sensing dipole in single lead implantable cardioverter defibrillator (VDD-ICD) recipients in particular diagnosing new-onset atrial high-rate episodes (AHREs) defined as rate threshold of 200 beats per minute, or subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF) defined as device-detected AF without symptoms. We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies comparing contemporary single- and dual-chamber ICD (VVI-/DDD-ICD) versus VDD-ICD were included. Restricted maximum likelihood method for random effect model and Mantel-Haenszel method for fixed effect model were used to estimate the effect size of new-onset AHREs, or SCAF detection in each group. Three prospective studies were identified and total of 991 participants were included. There were 330 (33.3%) in VDD-ICD and 661 (66.7%) in VVI-/DDD-ICD. Most (78%) participants were men. Median follow-up was from 365 days to 847 days. VDD-ICD has a higher likelihood of detecting AHREs or SCAF as compared to VVI-/DDD-ICD [(OR random effect : 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.8; p =.018); I-squared = 67.8%, p =.019]. This difference was more apparently seen in the comparison between VDD-ICD and VVI-ICD [(OR random effect: 3.8; 95% CI: 2.1, 6.6, p <.001), I-squared = 0.0%, p =.518]. The result is same as fixed effect. Rate of AHREs detection observed in VDD-ICD was not statistically different when compared to the only group with DDD-ICD from SENSE trial. In conclusion, this meta-analysis reveals that the use of floating atrial sensing dipole in VDD-ICD increases the detection of new-onset AHREs or SCAF when compared to VVI-ICD, with similar atrial sensing performance to DDD-ICD. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Background: Clinical trials of neuroprotection in acute ischemic stroke (AIS) have provided disappointing results. Reperfusion may be a necessary condition for positive effects of neuroprotective treatments. This systematic review provides an overview of efficacy of neuroprotective agents in combination with reperfusion therapy in AIS. Methods: A literature search was performed on the following databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare. All databases were searched up to September 23rd 2021. All randomized controlled trials in which patients were treated with neuroprotective strategies within 12 h of stroke onset in combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular therapy (EVT), or both were included. Results: We screened 1,764 titles/abstracts and included 30 full reports of unique studies with a total of 16,160 patients. In 15 studies neuroprotectants were tested for clinical efficacy, where all patients had to receive reperfusion therapies, either IVT and/or EVT. Heterogeneity in reported outcome measures was observed. Treatment was associated with improved clinical outcome for: 1) uric acid in patients treated with EVT and IVT, 2) nerinetide in patients who underwent EVT without IVT, 3) imatinib in stroke patients treated with IVT with or without EVT, 4) remote ischemic perconditioning and IVT, and 5) high-flow normobaric oxygen treatment after EVT, with or without IVT. Conclusion: Studies specifically testing effects of neuroprotective agents in addition to IVT and/or EVT are scarce. Future neuroprotection studies should report standardized functional outcome measures and combine neuroprotective agents with reperfusion therapies in AIS or aim to include prespecified subgroup analyses for treatment with IVT and/or EVT.

Herbal medicines are economical and generally free from potential side effects; therefore, they are acclaiming recognition. However, it is difficult to produce antiparasitic vaccines; major efforts have been made and still, there are no licensed vaccines currently available to control human parasitic ailments. This systematic review assesses various techniques for the treatment of parasitic infections. Moreover, the advancements and challenges involved in establishing novel trends in the development of more effective drug delivery systems are also investigated. Over the years, the inci-dences of several infectious ailments in humans have enhanced and it is estimated to further increase in the future. Over thirty new infective agents have been identified globally in the last 30 years; approximately 60 % of them are from zoonotic sources. Efficient drug delivery plays a key role in treating parasitic infections. The main goal of the modern antiparasitic drug delivery system is to minimize the potential side effects and deliver the drug directly to the target pathogens. There-fore, more sophisticated drug formulations than a simple tablet or solution are necessary for the treatment of many human parasitic diseases. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Background: Although prenatal chemical exposures influence neurobehavior, joint exposures are not well explored as risk factors for internalizing disorders through adolescence. Objective: To evaluate associations of prenatal organochlorine and metal exposures, considered individually and as a mixture, with mid-childhood and adolescent internalizing symptoms. Methods: Participants were 468 children from a prospective cohort recruited at birth (1993–1998) in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Organochlorines (hexachlorobenzene, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene, polychlorinated biphenyls) and metals (lead, manganese) were analyzed in cord blood. Internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depressive, somatic) were assessed via multiple informants on the Conners' Rating Scale (CRS) at 8-years and Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) at 15-years; higher T-scores indicate greater symptoms. Overall and sex-specific covariate-adjusted associations were evaluated using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) and five-chemical linear regression models. Results: The cohort was socioeconomically diverse (35% household income <$20,000; 55% maternal ≤ high school education at birth). Most chemical concentrations were consistent with background levels [e.g., median (range) cord blood lead: 1.1 (0–9.4) μg/dL]. BKMR suggested linear associations and no interactions between chemicals. The overall mixture was positively associated with Conners’ Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) and BASC-2 Self Report of Personality (SRP) anxiety and depressive symptoms, and negatively with somatic symptoms. Prenatal lead was positively associated with adolescent anxiety symptoms [1.56 (95% CI: 0.50, 2.61) BASC-2 SRP Anxiety score increase per doubling lead]. For CRPS and BASC-2 SRP, a doubling of cord blood manganese was positively associated with internalizing symptoms for girls [e.g., 3.26 (95% CI: 0.27, 6.25) BASC-2 SRP Depression score increase], but not boys. Organochlorine exposures were not adversely associated with internalizing symptoms. Discussion: Low-level prenatal lead exposure was positively associated with adolescent anxiety symptoms, and prenatal manganese exposure was positively associated with internalizing symptoms for girls from mid-childhood through adolescence. In utero neurotoxicant metal exposures may contribute to the emergence of anxiety and depression. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Pathological, atypical bisphosphonate, and segmental fractures were excluded, as were non-English literature.Data Extraction:Data from each study were independently recorded by 2 investigators.Data Synthesis:Agreement was obtained on 18 studies (all retrospective) for final inclusion, with 378 patients receiving cerclage wire and 911 without. A random-effects meta-analysis was used to analyze the pooled aggregate data.Conclusions:There is no statistically significant advantage in using cerclage wire with femoral intramedullary nail when treating subtrochanteric femur fractures regarding risk of reoperation, nonunion, loss of fixation, and implant failure or time to union. An advantage favoring cerclage wire was seen for accuracy of fracture reduction. Cerclage wiring was used more often in cases associated with high-energy trauma. Given the relatively small number of events available to be modelled, a clinical benefit for cerclage wiring may still exist for certain fracture types.Level of Evidence:Therapeutic Level III.

Our researchers evaluate included studies’ quality and risk of bias via the recommended tool. This study uses meta-analyses of random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Our research identified 43 cross-sectional, case-control, and cohort studies, including 40,141 individuals in America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. The summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident diabetes were 1.61 (1.10–2.39) for DDT, 1.67 (1.41–1.98) for DDE. The subgroup analysis indicated that the association is significantly higher in the region of Asia for both DDT (OR = 2.73) and DDE (OR = 2.62). Besides, we also tried various types of stratification to identify the more influential confounding factors, among which regional factors have a significant influence. Study evidence suggests that exposure to DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, might be associated with the risk of incident diabetes. Among Asian patients, DDT/DDE concentrations are more closely associated with diabetes. Further studies in specific regions will be considered in the future. © 2022},

	abstract = {Background: Human exposure to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) has been primarily attributed to contaminated food and drinking water. There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals. © 2022},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are ubiquitous in the environment and often ingested with food. PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based & no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I2 = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Aim: Laccases and peroxidases have attracted great interest for industrial and environmental applications. These enzymes have a broad substrate range and a robust oxidizing ability. Moreover, using mediators or co-oxidants makes it possible to increase their catalytic activity and extend their substrate scope to more resistant chemical structures. Background: Fungal laccases and ligninolytic peroxidases, mainly lignin and manganese peroxidases, are the privileged oxidoreductases for bioremediation processes. Nonetheless, an increasing diversity of laccases and peroxidase-type enzymes has been proposed for environmental technologies. Objective: This article aims to provide an overview of these enzymes and compare their applicability in the degradation of organic pollutants. Methods: Fundamental properties of the proteins are covered and applications towards polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides are specially focused. Results: Laccases are multicopper oxidases initially studied for applications in the pulp and paper in-dustry but able to oxidize a variety of environmentally concerning compounds. Relying on O2, laccases do not require peroxides nor auxiliary agents, like Mn2+, although suitable redox mediators are needed to attack the more recalcitrant pollutants (e.g., PAHs). True and pseudo-peroxidases use a stronger oxi-dant (H2O2) and the redox chemistry at the heme site generates high potential species that allow the oxidation of dyes and some pesticides. Conclusion: Lately, research efforts have been directed to enzyme discovery, testing with micropollu-tants, and improving biocatalysts’ stability by immobilization and protein engineering. Further under-standing of the effects of natural media components and solvents on the enzymes might lead to compet-itive enzymatic treatments of highly toxic media. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Background/Aim: This study aims to determine the safety and efficacy of integrated dual lag screw (IDL) cephalomedullary nails (CMN) when compared with single lag screw (SL) constructs, in the internal fixation of intertrochanteric femoral fractures. Methods: The Smith & Nephew InterTan IDL was compared with SL CMN group consisting of the Stryker Gamma-3 (G3) and Synthes Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) CMN. A multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies assessing the clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and perioperative parameters of InterTan versus G3 or PFNA CMN in patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were extracted and analysed. Results: 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 2643 patients. InterTan was associated with lower complication rates in terms of all-cause revisions (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.51; p < 0.001), cut-outs (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17–0.51; p < 0.001), medial or lateral screw migration (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.65; p = 0.008) as well as persistent hip and thigh pain (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.90; p = 0.008). In terms of perioperative parameters, InterTan is associated with longer operative times (MD 5.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.37–10.78 minutes, p = 0.04) and fluoroscopy times (MD 38.89 seconds, 95% CI, 15.88–61.91 seconds; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of clinical Harris Hip Score and radiological outcomes, non-union, haematoma, femoral fractures, varus collapse, length of stay and mean intraoperative blood loss between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Integrated dual lag screw cephalomedullary nails are associated with fewer revisions and complications. However, there is insufficient data to suggest that either nail construct is associated with better functional outcomes. © The Author(s) 2021.},

	abstract = {The role of environmental chemicals in the etiology of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) has been of interest in recent research. This scoping review aims to summarize known or possible associations between ADHD and environmental exposures to substances selected as priority chemicals of the European Human Biomonitoring Initiative (HBM4EU). Literature searches were performed in PubMed to identify relevant publications. Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research. The methods of the individual studies included in the reviews and meta-analyses covered in the current paper varied considerably. Making precise conclusions in terms of the strength of evidence on association between certain chemicals and ADHD was not straightforward. More research is needed for stronger evidence of associations or the lack of an association between specific chemical exposures and ADHD. © 2022 by the authors. Licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

	abstract = {Background: Developmental Defects of Enamel (DDE) is a pathology of the teeth that can greatly alter the quality of life of patients (hypersensitivity, esthetic issues, loss of function, etc.). The acquired DDE may occur as a result of a wide range of acquired etiological factors and his prevalence of this pathology may reach up to 89.9%. The main objective of this research was to identify and analyze, in current literature, the factors related to acquired DDE, in order to propose a general theory about the mechanisms involved. Methods: The search of the primary literature was conducted until [December 31, 2021]. Our search strategy uses the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and was structured around 3 terms [“Development,” “Defect,” and “Enamel”]. To be included, references had to be primary studies, written in English. Exclusion criteria were reviews, in vitro, animal, genetic or archeology studies, and studies focused on clinical management of DDE. One hundred and twenty three articles were included in this scoping review: 4 Randomized clinical trials, 1 letter, 5 cases reports, 2 fundamentals studies, and 111 observational studies (33 Cross-sectional studies, 68 Cohort study and 10 Case-control study). The quality of evidence was assessed using the PEDro scale for clinical trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies, and a published tool to assess the quality of case reports and case series. Results: A scoping review of the literature identified 114 factors potentially involved in acquired DDE. The most frequently encountered pathologies are those causing a disorder of calcium homeostasis or a perturbation of the ARNT pathway in mother or child. The link between the ARNT pathway and metabolism deficiency in uncertain and needs to be defined. Also, the implication of this mechanism in tissue impairment is still unclear and needs to be explored. Conclusions: By identifying and grouping the risk factors cited in the literature, this taxonomy and the hypotheses related to the mechanism allow health practitioners to adopt behaviors that limit the risk of developing aDDE and to set up a prevention of dental pathology. In addition, by reviewing the current literature, this work provides guidance for basic research, clinical studies, and literature searches.

	abstract = {Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) include a series of conditions that can be poorly tolerated, negatively affecting the quality of life. Current treatment options show unsatisfactory results and new ones are therefore needed. Stem cell (SC) therapy might be an alternative treatment strategy. This systematic review aims to define the state of art of SC therapy for PFDs in clinical trials, by systematically reviewing the available evidence. A systematic search strategy was conducted up to November 7, 2020, in PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and ISI Web of Science. Preclinical studies on animal models were not considered. Studies were included when the patients were affected by any PFDs and cells were isolated, cultured, and characterized as SC. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020216551). A total of 11 prospective clinical studies were included in the final assessment, specifically 7 single-arm studies dealing with SC therapy for stress urinary incontinence and 4 with anal incontinence. Among the latter, there were two prospective, single-arm studies and two randomized controlled trials. No papers concerning the use of SC for prolapse repair were retrieved. Due to the great heterogeneity, data pooling was not possible. Stem cell injection resulted in a safe procedure, with few mild adverse side effects, mostly related to harvesting sites. However, a clear beneficial impact of SC treatment for the treatment of pelvic floor disorders could not be demonstrated. Further larger targeted studies with control arms are needed before any conclusions can be made. © 2021, The Author(s).},

	abstract = {Plastics are a group of synthetic materials made of organic polymers and some additives with special characteristics. Plastics have become part of our daily life due to their many applications and uses. However, inappropriately managed plastic waste has raised concern regarding their ecotoxicological and human health risks in the long term. Due to the non-biodegradable nature of plastics, their waste may take several thousands of years to partially degrade in natural environments. Plastic fragments/particles can be very minute in size and are mistaken easily for prey or food by aquatic organisms (e.g., invertebrates, fishes). The surface properties of plastic particles, including large surface area, functional groups, surface topography, point zero charge, influence the sorption of various contaminants, including heavy metals, oil spills, PAHs, PCBs and DDT. Despite the fact that the number of studies on the biological effects of plastic particles on biota and humans has been increasing in recent years, studies on mixtures of plastics and other chemical contaminants in the aquatic environment are still limited. This review aims to gather information about the main characteristics of plastic particles that allow different types of contaminants to adsorb on their surfaces, the consequences of this adsorption, and the interactions of plastic particles with aquatic biota. Additionally, some missing links and potential solutions are presented to boost more research on this topic and achieve a holistic view on the effects of micro-and nanoplastics to biological systems in aquatic environments. It is urgent to implement measures to deal with plastic pollution that include improving waste management, monitoring key plastic particles, their hotspots, and developing their assessment techniques, using alternative products, determining concentrations of micro-and nanoplastics and the contaminants in freshwater and marine food-species consumed by humans, applying clean-up and remediation strategies, and biodegradation strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Topic: A variety of different tamponade agents are used with vitrectomy combined with internal limiting membrane (ILM) peeling for the treatment of idiopathic macular holes. These agents include air, gas (sulfur hexafluoride [SF6], hexafluoroethane [C2F6], and perfluoropropane [C3F8]), and silicone oil. The optimal tamponade agent is uncertain, and we aimed to review the effect of tamponade choice on hole closure and visual outcomes. Clinical relevance: Although most surgeons initially chose to use long-acting gas (C3F8), there has been a gradual change in practice to the increasing use of the medium- (C2F6) and short-acting gases (SF6) or even air. However, there is no consensus regarding their relative efficacies. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies comparing different tamponade agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy and ILM peeling for primary idiopathic macular holes. For RCTs, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, whereas for nonrandomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used. Results: Thirteen publications, including 2 RCTs, were identified. Overall, there was no significant difference in the anatomic closure rates between studies using SF6 compared with either C3F8 or C2F6 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51–1.08). A subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher closure rate using SF6 (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.30–0.79) in patients without postoperative posturing but not in those who were advised to posture facedown. The visual outcomes and adverse events were not significantly different. The comparisons of anatomic closure rates of patients treated with gas tamponade vs. silicone oil and with air vs. SF6 showed no significant differences. The included studies had a number of methodological limitations and heterogeneities, making conclusions imprecise, with low or very low certainty by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Conclusion: The current evidence base for tamponade selection with vitrectomy and ILM peeling for full-thickness macular hole has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection. © 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic activity-impacted aquatic environment contains a complex mixture of contaminants, and ecological risk assessment solely based on chemical analysis is insufficient and biological assessment is required. However, traditional assessment heavily relies on laboratory bioassays, which may cause uncertainty due to inevitable laboratory-related artifact. A self-designed in-situ bioassay system was successfully applied to simultaneously evaluate water and sediment toxicity by co-exposure of two native species, Chinese rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) in Tai Lake Basin, China. In-situ exposure caused pronouncedly lethal and sublethal effects (i.e., metabolic and oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity) on both fish and clams. Meanwhile, multi-media distribution of organic contaminants in water-sediment-biota system was analyzed. Besides hydrophobicity, metabolism was recognized as an influential factor on phase distribution of contaminants in water-fish and sediment-clam systems. Traditional hazard quotient (HQ) method based on environmental concentrations of 98 contaminants showed bias in risk assessment. Instead, a weight of evidence method by integrating three lines of evidence, including in-situ survival, enhanced integrated biomarker response values and environmental concentrations, successfully differentiate high- and moderate-risk sites in the shallow lakes. The present study incorporated in-situ bioassays into risk assessment using a weight of evidence approach, which reduced uncertainty in decision-making. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {The emergence of resistance against common antibiotics in the gut microbiota is a major issue for both human and livestock health. This highlights the need for understanding the impact of such application on the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in poultry gut and devising means to circumvent the potential resistome expansion. Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) are potential natural alternative to antibiotic to improve animal health and performance, supposedly via positively affecting the gut microbial ecosystem, but there is little systematic information available. In this time-course study, we applied a shotgun meta-transcriptomics approach to investigate the impact of a PFA product as well as the commonly used antibiotic, zinc bacitracin either at AGP concentration or therapeutic concentration on the gut microbiome and resistome of broiler chickens raised for 35 days. Over the course of the trial, PFA treatments increased the abundance of Firmicutes such as Lactobacillus and resulted in a lower abundance of Escherichia, while the latter group increased significantly in the feces of chickens that received either AGP or AB doses of bacitracin. Tetracycline resistance and aminoglycoside resistance were the predominant antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) classes found, regardless of the treatment. PFA application resulted in a decrease in abundance of ARGs compared to those in the control group and other antibiotic treatment groups. In summary, the findings from this study demonstrate the potential of phytogenic feed additives could be an alternative to antibiotics in poultry farming, with the added benefit of counteracting antimicrobial resistance development.

	abstract = {Although previous meta-analyses have shown that prenatal PFASs exposure is associated with reduction in birth weight, effects of prenatal PFASs exposure on birth outcomes have not been fully explored. We conducted a meta-analysis of 23 eligible studies searched from Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science before March 21, 2021 to analyze the association between prenatal PFASs exposure and birth outcomes, including premature birth (PTB), low birth weight (LBW), small for gestational age (SGA) and miscarriage. Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding confidence intervals were extracted for analysis. According to the heterogeneity of the included studies, fixed-effects (I2 ≤ 50%) and random-effects (I2 > 50%) models were applied respectively. The significant associations between PFOS and PTB (pooled OR = 1.54, 95% CI: 1.20–1.98), PFOA and miscarriage (pooled OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.15–1.70), and PFOS and LBW (pooled OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.19–1.94) were obtained. There were differences between included studies with different study regions, sampling time, and samples type used for PFASs assessment. These findings may provide insight in risk assessment and decision-making in producing products that contain PFASs. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Plastic, paper and cardboard are widely used as food contact materials (FCMs), due to its numerous favourable characteristics. However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil- and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

For this review, we searched the Web of Science database for articles published from 2011 to 2021 using the keywords “toxic” and “earthworm” and retrieved 632 publications. From the perspective of bibliometric analysis, we conducted a co-occurrence network analysis using the keywords “toxic” and “earthworm” to identify the most and least reported topics. “Eisenia fetida,” “bioaccumulation,” “heavy metals,” “oxidative stress,” and “pesticides” were the most common terms, and “microbial community,” “bacteria,” “PFOS,” “bioaugmentation,” “potentially toxic elements,” “celomic fluid,” “neurotoxicity,” “joint toxicity,” “apoptosis,” and “nanoparticles” were uncommon terms. Additionally, in this review we highlight the main routes of organic pollutant entry into soil, and discuss the adverse effects on the soil ecosystem. We then systematically review the mechanisms underlying organic pollutant toxicity to earthworms, including oxidative stress, energy and lipid metabolism disturbances, neurological toxicity, intestinal inflammation and injury, gut microbiota dysbiosis, and reproductive toxicity. We conclude by discussing future research perspectives, focusing on environmentally relevant concentrations and conditions, novel data processing approaches, technologies, and detoxification and mitigation methods.

The microbial community present at such sites has the potential to remediate these contaminants. The present study highlights the metabolic potential of the resident bacterial community of PAHs and PCB contaminated soil nearby Bhilai steel plant, Chhattisgarh (India). The GC-MS/MS analysis of soil samples MGB-2 (sludge) and MGB-3 (dry soil) resulted in identification of different classes of POPs including PAHs {benzo[a]anthracene (nd; 17.69%), fluorene (15.89%, nd), pyrene (nd; 18.7%), benzo(b)fluoranthene (3.03%, nd), benzo(k) fluoranthene (11.29%; nd), perylene (5.23%; nd)} and PCBs (PCB-15, PCB-95, and PCB-136). Whole-genome metagenomic analysis by Oxford Nanopore GridION Technology revealed predominance of domain bacteria (97.4%; 97.5%) followed by eukaryote (1.4%; 1.5%), archaea (1.2%; 0.9%) and virus (0.02%; 0.04%) in MGB-2 and MGB-3 respectively. Proteobacteria (44.3%; 50.0%) to be the prominent phylum followed by Actinobacteria (22.1%; 19.5%) in MBG-2 and MBG-3, respectively. However, Eukaryota microbial communities showed a predominance of phylum Ascomycota (20.5%; 23.6%), Streptophyta (18.5%, 17.0%) and unclassified (derived from Eukaryota) (12.1%; 12.2%) in MGB-2 and MGB-3. The sample MGB-3 was richer in macronutrients (C, N, P), supporting high microbial diversity than MGB-2. The presence of reads for biphenyl degradation, dioxin degradation, PAH degradation pathways can be further correlated with the presence of PCB and PAH as detected in the MGB-2 and MGB-3 samples. Further, taxonomic vis-à-vis functional analysis identified Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, Mycobacterium, and Rhodopseudomonas as the keystone degrader of PAH and PCB. Overall, our results revealed the importance of metagenomic and physicochemical analysis of the contaminated site, which improves the understanding of metabolic potential and adaptation of bacteria growing under POP contaminated environments. © 2022 Sandhu et al.

	abstract = {Background: Crop farming contributes to one of the most extensive land use activities in the world, and cropland areas continue to rise. Many vertebrate species feed on crops, which has caused an increase in human-wildlife conflicts in croplands. Crop-feeding damages the economy of local communities and causes retaliation against the responsible vertebrates in several forms, including lethal practices such as hunting and poisoning. Lethal control may cause the local extirpation of some species, affecting ecological processes and patterns. Therefore, it is necessary to find non-lethal alternatives that can protect both local economies and wildlife. Research has been conducted in Africa and Asia, focusing on elephants and primates, and the effectiveness of some non-lethal alternatives, such as chili-based repellents and beehives, is being investigated. However, there has been very little research on this topic in Central and South America. The goal of this review is to assess the current knowledge on crop damage by vertebrates in Central and South America and indicate future research directions. Survey methodology: We reviewed the available scientific literature reporting crop damage by vertebrates in Central and South America, and the Caribbean, published between 1980 and 2020, through systematic searches on Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We analyzed the temporal and geographical distributions of the studies, the crops and vertebrate species these studies considered, the crop protection techniques used, and their effectiveness. Results: We retrieved only 113 studies on crop damage by vertebrates in Latin America, but there was an increasing trend in the number of studies published over time. Most of the studies were conducted in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Costa Rica. Four orders of mammals (Rodentia, Carnivora, Artiodactyla, and Primates) and four orders of birds (Passeriformes, Columbiformes, Psittaciformes, and Anseriformes) were the most common groups of crop-feeding vertebrates. The most prominent crop was corn, which was featured in 49% of the studies. Other notable crops include rice, sorghum, and sugarcane. The most reported method for protecting crops was lethal control through hunting or poisoning. Non-lethal techniques were found to be less prevalent. Less than half of the studies that mentioned the use of protection techniques indicated their effectiveness, and only 10 studies evaluated it by performing scientific experiments and reporting their results. Conclusions: Central and South America is still underrepresented in research on vertebrate crop-feeding. There is a need for experimentation-based robust research to find crop protection techniques that minimize harm to vertebrates while effectively reducing damage to crops. While this is being studied, habitat loss and fragmentation need to be halted to prevent the native vertebrates from turning to crops for food. Copyright 2022 Alejandro Cuesta Hermira and Michalski},

	abstract = {Water pollution is becoming an inevitable problem in today's world. Tons and tons of wastewater with hazardous pollutants are getting discharged into the clean water bodies every day. In this regard, photocatalytic environmental remediation using nanotechnology such as the use of organic, metal and non-metal based semiconductor photocatalysts for photodegradation of pollutants has gained enormous attention in the past few decades. This review is focused particularly on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) which is a cheap, metal-free, polymeric photoactive compound and it is used as a potential photocatalyst in wastewater treatment. Though, pristine g-C3N4 is a good photocatalyst, it has certain drawbacks such as poor visible light absorption capacity, quicker recombination of photoelectrons and holes, delayed mass and charge transfer, etc. As a result, the pristine g-C3N4 catalyst is modified into novel 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D morphologies such as nano-quantum dots, nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires, nanosheets, nanoflakes, nanospheres, nanoshells, etc. It was also tailored into novel composites along with various compounds through doping, metal deposition, heterojunction formation, etc., to enhance the photocatalytic property of pure g-C3N4. The modified catalysts showed promising photocatalytic performance such as degradation of majority of pollutants in the environment. It also showed excellent results in the removal or reduction of heavy metals.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Maternal exposure to environmental chemicals during pregnancy can influence various maternal and offspring health parameters. Modification of maternal metabolism by environmental exposure may be an important pathway for these impacts. However, there is limited evidence regarding exposure to a wide array of chemicals and the metabolome during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between the urinary exposome and metabolome during pregnancy. METHODS: Urine samples were collected in the first and third trimesters from 1,024 pregnant women recruited in prenatal clinics in Jiangsu Province, China. The exposome was analyzed using the first trimester sample with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The metabolome was analyzed using the third trimester sample with UHPLC-HRMS. We evaluated associations between each of 106 exposures in the first trimester with 139 metabolites in the third trimester. RESULTS: We identified 1,245 significant associations (p < 3:39 × 10−6, Bonferroni correction) between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Among elements, the largest number of the significant metabolic associations were observed for magnesium, and among organic compounds, for 4-tert-octylphenol. We used exposome–metabolome associations to explore mechanisms underlying published associations between prenatal chemical exposures and offspring health outcomes. This integration of the literature with our results suggests that reported associations between 10 analytes and birth weight, gestational age, fat deposition, neurobehavioral development, immunological disorders, and hypertension may be partially mediated by metabolites associated with these exposures. DISCUSSION: This high-dimensional analysis of the urinary exposome and metabolome identified many associations between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Integration of these associations with the literature on health outcomes of exposure suggests that environmental modulation of the maternal metabolome may play a role in the association between prenatal exposure on pregnancy and child health outcomes. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

	abstract = {Background: Prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs), widespread in North America, is associated with increased Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) symptoms and may be a modifiable risk for ADHD phenotypes. However, the effects of moderate exposure to POPs on task-based inhibitory control performance, related brain function, and ADHD-related symptoms remain unknown, limiting our ability to develop interventions targeting the neural impact of common levels of exposure. Objectives: The goal of this study was to examine the association between prenatal POP exposure and inhibitory control performance, neural correlates of inhibitory control and ADHD-related symptoms. Methods: Prospective data was gathered in an observational study of Canadian mother-child dyads, with moderate exposure to POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), as part of the GESTation and the Environment (GESTE) cohort in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. The sample included 87 eligible children, 46 with maternal plasma samples, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of Simon task performance at 9–11 years, and parental report of clinical symptoms via the Behavioral Assessment System for Children 3 (BASC-3). Simon task performance was probed via drift diffusion modeling, and parameter estimates were related to POP exposure. Simon task-based fMRI data was modeled to examine the difference in incongruent vs congruent trials in regions of interest (ROIs) identified by meta analysis. Results: Of the 46 participants with complete data, 29 were male, and mean age was 10.42 ± 0.55 years. Increased POP exposure was associated with reduced accuracy (e.g. PCB molar sum rate ratio = 0.95; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]), drift rate (e.g. for PCB molar sum β = −0.42; 95% CI [-0.77, −0.07]), and task-related brain activity (e.g. in inferior frontal cortex for PCB molar sum β = −0.35; 95% CI [-0.69, −0.02]), and increased ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity PCB molar sum β = 2.35; 95%CI [0.17, 4.53]), supporting the possibility that prenatal exposure to POPs is a modifiable risk for ADHD phenotypes. Discussion: We showed that exposure to POPs is related to task-based changes in neural activity in brain regions important for inhibitory control, suggesting a biological mechanism underlying previously documented associations between POPs and neurobehavioral deficits found in ADHD phenotypes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Insecticides are widely used in agriculture as effective means to control pests. However, pests have not been completely mitigated with the increased use of insecticides. Instead, many side effects have arisen, especially the ‘3Rs’ (resistance, resurgence, and residue). The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is one of the most threatening rice pests. The main insecticides for controlling N. lugens belong to organochlorine, organophosphorus, carbamate, neonicotinoid and pyrethroid groups. However, metabolic enzymes, including cytochrome P450s, esterases, glutathione-S-transferases, and ATP-binding cassette transporters, effectively promote the detoxification of insecticides. Besides, mutations of neurological target sites, such as acetylcholinesterase, nicotinic acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor, and ryanodine receptor, result in insensitivity to insecticides. Here, we review the physiological metabolic resistance in N. lugens under insecticide stress to provide a theoretical basis for identifying and developing more effective and harmless insecticides. © 2022, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.},

	abstract = {Low birthweight (LBW) is a worldwide public health concern, while the global burden of LBW attributable to endocrine-disrupting chemicals, such as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), has not yet been evaluated. Here, we established a large dataset for the biomonitoring of seven representative congeners of PFAS by examining data from 2325 publications. Global exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the highest, followed by perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Spatiotemporal exposure to PFAS varied considerably, with daily intake estimated in the range of 0.01-1.7 ng/kg/day. Moreover, decreasing trends in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA exposure were noted in most regions of the world over the past two decades, but such trends were not observed for other PFAS with long carbon chains, especially in East Asia. Furthermore, we estimated that human exposure to PFOA contributed to approximately 461,635 (95% confidence interval: 57,418 to 854,645) cases per year of LBW during the past two decades, predominantly from Asian regions. Although our estimation may be constrained by uncertainties from the dose-response curve and data availability, this study has unveiled that PFAS might be a contributor to global LBW prevalence during 2000-2019, supporting continuous actions to mitigate PFAS contamination. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {Clean gas fire suppressants with high efficiency are widely applied. This paper provides a systematic review of the research advances in the novel environmentally friendly suppressant, C6F12O. Considering the principle of screening fire suppressants, the physical and chemical properties of C6F12O are presented first. Specifically, research on the measurement of the thermodynamic parameters, toxicity, corrosion, environmental compatibility and dispersion characteristics are summarized, revealing that the poor dispersibility, corrosion of the hydrolysates (perfluoropropionic acid), corrosion and toxicity of thermal breakdown products such as HF and COF2 and environmentally unfriendly products such as perfluorocarbons should be paid more attention. Three main synthesis routes of C6F12O are also introduced in view of its promising prospects for application. Furthermore, the fire extinguishing efficiency of C6F12O has been fully investigated in both a laboratory burner scale and full-scale fire extinguishing experiment, the results of which show that the minimum extinguishing volume concentration of C6F12O is lower than HFCs, but the mass concentration is much higher. Although C6F12O has shown satisfactory fire extinguishing performance in various fire protection scenarios, fire enhancement phenomenon and the large production of HF have been observed during fire extinguishment. Finally, the fire extinguishing mechanism of C6F12O has been discussed. The flame suppression effect of C6F12O, combustion enhancement phenomenon and the influence of water in the reaction zone have been revealed. This review fully evaluates C6F12O, in hope that it will provide a reference for follow-up research and the development of a halon replacement. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Objective: This systematic review investigated whether people with patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) have muscle strength, volume, and activation around the hip and knee that is different from asymptomatic controls. Methods: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation. Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least two studies reporting the same domain. Results: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95%CI = −1.34 to −0.57), hip external rotation (−0.55;-1.07 to −0.03), hip extension (−0.72;-1.16 to −0.28), and knee extension (−0.97;-1.41 to −0.53) when compared to asymptomatic controls. People with PFOA also presented with smaller volumes of the gluteus medius, gluteus minimus, tensor fascia lata, vastus medialis (VM), vastus lateralis (VL) and rectus femoris when compared to asymptomatic controls. Also, people with PFOA presented with changes in muscle activation for the VL, VM and gluteus maximus (GMax) when compared to asymptomatic controls. Conclusion: People with PFOA present with lower strength and volume of the hip and quadriceps muscles and altered muscle activation of the VM, VL and GMax during ascending and descending stairs when compared to asymptomatic controls. However, the certainty of these findings are very low. Trial Registration Number: PROSPERO systematic review protocol (ID = CRD42020197776) © 2022},

	abstract = {This paper presents an up-to-date meta-analysis assessing per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance (PFAS) concentrations at wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as well as changes over time. PFAS concentrations were compiled for WWTPs in the United States from peer-reviewed studies, technical reports, and original data. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) increased by an average of 6.0 ± 1.6 ng/L from the influents to the effluents of WWTPs, but perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS) did not significantly change, indicating sorption to sludge is offset by biotransformation of precursor compounds. The occurrence of individual PFAS may vary temporally; for example, perfluoropentanoic acid correlated weakly with seasonal temperatures at a site in Virginia. Wastewater effluent PFOA concentrations decreased at a site in Nevada from 2012 to February 2020 but appeared to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Effluent PFOA also declined nationally from 1999 to 2020 by ∼13% per year. Nevertheless, the national mean PFOA concentration was 8.4 ± 0.4 ng/L in data collected from 2013 to 2020 with outliers omitted, indicating persisting low-level occurrence. This would equate to 383 ± 20 kg of PFOA per year continuing to enter the environment via WWTP effluents. © 2022 American Chemical Society.},

	abstract = {A new bacterium, Rhodococcus sp. S2-17, which could completely degrade an emerging organic pollutant, benzophenone-3 (BP-3), was isolated from contaminated sediment through an enrichment procedure, and its BP-3 catabolic pathway and genes were identified through metabolic intermediate and transcriptomic analyses and biochemical and genetic studies. Metabolic intermediate analysis suggested that strain S2-17 may degrade BP-3 using a catabolic pathway progressing via the intermediates BP-1, 2,4,5-trihydroxy-benzophenone, 3-hydroxy-4-benzoyl-2,4-hexadienedioic acid, 4-benzoyl-3-oxoadipic acid, 3-oxoadipic acid, and benzoic acid. A putative BP-3 catabolic gene cluster including cytochrome P450, flavin-dependent oxidoreductase, hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase, maleylacetate reductase, and α/β hydrolase genes was identified through genomic and transcriptomic analyses. Genes encoding the cytochrome P450 complex that demethylates BP-3 to BP-1 were functionally verified through protein expression, and the functions of the other genes were also verified through knockout mutant construction and intermediate analysis. This study suggested that strain S2-17 might have acquired the ability to catabolize BP-3 by recruiting the cytochrome P450 complex and α/β hydrolase, which hydrolyzes 4-benzoyl-3-oxoadipic acid to benzoic acid and 3-oxoadipic acid, genes, providing insights into the recruitment of genes of for the catabolism of emerging organic pollutants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Scabies is a contagious parasitic skin disease caused by Sarcoptes scabiei infestation which can be transmitted through direct or indirect contact. WHO classified scabies as a neglected tropical disease. The prevalence of scabies is high in certain countries ranging from 32.1% to 74%, especially in crowded conditions such as prisons, boarding schools, and orphanages. Indonesia is one of the most heavily affected countries worldwide. Scabies might cause great impact on patients, which includes decreased concentration and academic achievement at school, social stigma, sleep disturbances, and decreased economic productivity in community. Management of scabies with anti-scabies needs to be carried out appropriately, accompanied with treatment for all contacts. Mass treatment with permethrin cream or ivermectin can be given directly to patients. Prevention is conducted by providing medical treatment and breaking the chain of transmission. Source elimination and disinfection of fomites is very important. Participation of non-medical personnel such as teachers, cadres, and parents together with the local health workers (primary health care) is highly recommended. Using checklists or application can aid non-medical personnel to determine suspected cases, thus contributing to scabies elimination. Cooperation between patients, patient's family, health workers and other non-medical personnel will greatly reduce the prevalence of scabies and ultimately improve patient's quality of life. The aim of this review is to provide an update on scabies treatment and efforts for prevention and elimination, with focus on the situation in Indonesia. Copyright © 2022 Widaty et al.

	abstract = {Exposure to per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), ubiquitous persistent environmental contaminants, has led to substantial global concern due to their potential environmental and human health effects. Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings.  © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.},

Often the focus is on the effects that we can directly and see such as decreased air quality and higher than normal temperatures and weather, but the effects we cannot see are frequently overlooked. For at least the past decade increasing importance has been given towards the effects of pollution of living animals or non-target organisms and plants. For this purpose, one model animal that surfaced is the purpose, one model animal surfaced is Mytilus galloprovincialis. As all mussels, this species is capable of bio-accumulating important quantities of different xenobiotics such as pesticides, paints, medicines, heavy metals, industrial compounds, and even compounds marketed as antioxidants and antivirals. Their toxic effects can be assessed through their impact on oxidative stress, lysosomal membrane stability, and cell viability through trypan blue exclusion test and neutral red retention assay techniques. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the benefits of using M. galloprovincialis as an animal model for toxicological assays of various classes of xenobiotics by bringing to light the studies that have approached the matter. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.},

Nine studies were included for analysis. Endocrine-disrupting chemicals are significantly associated with the reproductive system of male rodents of F3 generation, especially the testis (RR = 3.13, 95% CI: 2.05, 4.76), prostate (RR = 2.26, 95% CI: 1.27, 4.00), and kidney (RR = 2.83, 95% CI: 1.77, 4.52), but the current analysis does not prove that EDCs are the adverse factors for puberty abnormalities.

Microbial communities and their biofilms inhabiting these extreme habitats have developed different adaptive strategies in metabolizing and transforming the persistent pollutants. They also play a crucial role in natural attenuation of these abandoned mining sites and act as a major driver of many biogeochemical processes, which helps in ecological rehabilitation and is a viable approach for restoration of wide stretches of land. In this review, the types of mine wastes including the overburden and mine drainage and the types of microbial communities thriving in such environments were probed in detail. The types of biofilms formed along with their possible role in metal bioremediation were also reviewed. This review also provides an overview of the shift in microbial communities in natural reclamation process and also provides an insight into the restoration of the enzyme activities of the soils which may help in further revegetation of abundant mining areas in a sustainable manner. Moreover, the role of indigenous microbiota in bioremediation of heavy metals and their plant growth-promoting activity weres discussed to assess their role in phytoremedial processes. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) are emerging environmental pollutants, and the effect of both abiotic (e.g., anthropogenic pollutants such as sulfonamides (SAs)) and biotic (e.g., microbial community (taxonomy), mobile genetic elements (MGEs)) factors on the antibiotic resistome (collection of ARGs) has received much attention recently. In addition, function (e.g., CAZy, eggNOG and KEGG) is also an important biotic factor; however, how function correlates to ARGs and thus contributes to the antibiotic resistome remains ambiguous. This work explores the effect of sulfonamides (SAs) on ARGs and MGEs by a metagenomic analysis, a principal component analysis (PCA), and a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS). Then, the work establishes a correlation between ARGs and function with a co-occurrence network and reveals the contribution and positive (negative)/direct (indirect) effect of taxonomy, MGEs, and function to the antibiotic resistome by variation partitioning analysis (VPA) and partial least-squares-path modeling (PLS-PM). The results show that the soil has diverse ARGs and several MGEs and SAs impose significant effects on them. Further, CAZy, eggNOG, and KEGG (including pathway and orthology) show strong and significant correlation with ARGs on the basis of the co-occurrence network; however, in our system it seems that only the KEGG pathway promotes the interpretation of ARGs and should be regarded as the priority function on considering the role of function in structuring the antibiotic resistome. This work reveals the importance and necessity of function as a biotic factor in shaping the antibiotic resistome in diverse resistome-related fields. © 2021 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Pesticides such as insecticides，fungicides，and herbicides play an important role in the global agricultural industry as they reduce the occurrence of crop diseases，kill pests，and remove weeds. On the other hand，these pesticides are a double-edged sword because they have both acute effects and chronic adverse effects on human health. The widespread use of pesticides has led to their persistence in soil，water，and agricultural products，thus posing a serious threat to public health. Therefore，the removal and analysis of pesticides are critical to protecting human safety and health. When removing pesticides from the environment，it is imperative to ensure high removal efficiency while preventing secondary pollution to the environment. Because of the low concentrations of pesticide residue in the environment，complex matrix，and large throughput of pesticide residue analysis，a low-cost fast pre-treatment technique that has strong selectivity and an enrichment effect on the target pesticide residue，with little environmental impact，is required. Plant biomass-derived biochar is obtained from wheat straw，corn cob，rice husk，etc. This material has a large specific surface area，high pore capacity, tunable surface functional groups, and good environmental compatibility, which make it an inexpensive and efficient adsorbent. Hence, there is a need to systematically review the knowledge regarding the application of plant-based biochar on pesticide removal and pesticide residue analysis. This paper reviews the application progress of plant biomass-derived biochar in the above mentioned two areas over the last decade. The pesticide removal applications include reducing the mobility of pesticides in soil, eliminating the pollution caused by chiral pesticides, loading pesticide-degrading bacteria, and releasing fertilizers sustainably when removing pesticide. As mentioned above, plant biomass-derived biochar has a large specific surface area, a high number of functional groups on the surface, and good environmental compatibility. Therefore, it can effectively remove pesticides or their metabolites from the environment without causing any secondary pollution. During pre-treatment, plan biomass-derived biochar is used as an adsorbent for dispersive solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, and magnetic solid-phase extraction to selectively adsorb organophosphorus and triazole pesticides in fruits and vegetables, as well as organochlorine pesticides in the aquatic environment. This paper also introduces the adsorption mechanism of plant biomass-derived biochar, where studies based on computational simulations such as the density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulation, and giant canonical Monte Carlo simulation are carefully discussed. The benefits of adopting computational simulations are also mentioned. Finally, this paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of using plant biomass-derived biochar in pesticide removal and pre-treatment, as well as the future research trends in this area. © 2022.

	abstract = {A fungal strain (FJII-L10-SW-P1) was isolated from the Mars 2020 spacecraft assembly facility and exhibited biofilm formation on spacecraft-qualified Teflon surfaces. The reconstruction of a six-loci gene tree (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1 and RPB2, and TEF1) using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of the strain FJII-L10-SW-P1 supported a close relationship to other known Parengyodontium album subclade 3 isolates while being phylogenetically distinct from subclade 1 strains. The zig-zag rachides morphology of the conidiogenous cells and spindle-shaped conidia were the distinct morphological characteristics of the P. album subclade 3 strains. The MLST data and morphological analysis supported the conclusion that the P. album subclade 3 strains could be classified as a new species of the genus Parengyodontium and placed in the family Cordycipitaceae. The name Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the strain, with FJII-L10-SW-P1 as the holotype. The genome of the FJII-L10-SW-P1 strain was sequenced, annotated, and the secondary metabolite clusters were identified. Genes predicted to be responsible for biofilm formation and adhesion to surfaces were identified. Homology-based assignment of gene ontologies to the predicted proteome of P. torokii revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for synthesizing several metabolic compounds, including a cytochalasin that was also verified using traditional metabolomic analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

It is mainly caused by degenerative disc disease (DDD), a progressive, chronic, and age-related process. With its capacity to accurately characterize intervertebral disc (IVD) and spinal morphology, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has been established as one of the most valuable tools in diagnosing DDD. However, existing technology cannot detect subtle changes in IVD tissue composition and cell metabolism. In this review, we summarized the state of the art regarding innovative quantitative MRI modalities that have shown the capacity to discriminate and quantify changes in matrix composition and integrity, as well as biomechanical changes in the early stages of DDD. Validation and implementation of this new technology in the clinical setting will allow for an early diagnosis of DDD and ideally guide conservative and regenerative treatments that may prevent the progression of the degenerative process rather than intervene at the latest stages of the disease. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Background: Patellofemoral arthroplasty (PFA) is a surgical option for patients older than 40 years old who are affected by patellofemoral osteoarthritis. Regarding the complications of PFAs, few studies have investigated periprosthetic fractures. The purpose of this literature review was to highlight a previously overlooked complication of primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint. Methods: Three literature databases were searched for studies published between 2000 to 2020 using relevant keywords. A total of 4,942 articles were originally identified. After excluding duplicates and analysing the titles and abstracts, 20 studies were considered. From these, data regarding the number of cases, clinical outcomes and complications were extracted. Results: Among the 20 selected articles, only one described periprosthetic fractures as a complication of PFAs. Herein, we also report an illustrative case of an unknown fracture complication. No cases in the literature were found that described the type of complications experienced by our patient during the postoperative period. Conclusions: This review confirms the lack of data about clinical outcomes and fracture complications of PFAs. In primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint, patient selection and close consideration of demographic factors (such as BMI and age) and intraoperative factors (such as patellar thickness and size of the trochlear component) play a key role in optimising pre-operative planning to avoid intraoperative periprosthetic fractures. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {Background:Femoral intertrochanteric fractures (ITF) occur frequently in the elderly, accounting for 45% of all hip fractures. Postoperative anemia after fracture tends to cause ischemia, hypoxia in cells, tissues and organs, increasing the rate of blood transfusion, risk of infection, disability and mortality. Meanwhile, traditional Chinese medicine is widely used in the treatment of anemia for activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis.Methods:This study is a prospective, outcome assessor-, and data analyst-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. The objective of this proposed study was to investigate whether Shengyu Decoction could improve the symptoms of anemia after proximal femoral nail antirotation in elderly ITF patients. After qualifying for screening, patients will be randomized into 2 groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Hemoglobin concentration, HBL, and HHS score are outcome measurements. The other outcomes also included time to get out of bed, discharge to home, 30-day readmission rates, and mortality.Discussion:ITF is commonly occurring in senior citizens, and those who are senior in age generally suffer 1 or more basic diseases, whose nutritional status is already poor. Trauma and surgical stimulation not only aggravate the existing disease or induce corresponding cardiovascular complications, but also worsen the nutritional status, which can easily cause postoperative anemia in patients. Because of the limited clinical modalities available for the treatment of postoperative anemia after fracture surgery, and most of them have various side effects that are not easily tolerated by the elderly. Therefore, from a traditional Chinese medicine perspective, we proposed a protocol using mild Chinese herbal decoction to treat postoperative anemia in ITF.Registration number: OSF Registration number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/JQ6ZF. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

	abstract = {Background: In Iran, the prospect of malaria control relies mainly on insecticides used against the genus Anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae) as important vectors of malaria, arboviruses, and so on. Only eight out of 30 malaria mosquito vectors (Anopheles species) have been examined for insecticide resistance in Iran. This study aimed to review articles related to the incremental trend in insecticide resistance and their mechanisms among anopheline malaria vectors in Iran. Methods: A literature review was conducted based on such search engines as Iran doc, Web of Science, SID, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar websites using the following keywords: “Anopheles,” “Malaria,” “Resistance,” “Vectors,” “Insecticide Resistance,” and “Iran” for data collection. Published papers in English or Persian covering 1980 to 2020 were reviewed. Results: A total of 1125 articles were screened, only 16 of which were filtered to be pertinent in this review. While most of the mosquito vectors of malaria, such as Anopheles stephensi, were resistant to DDT, dieldrin, malathion, and becoming less susceptible to deltamethrin and other synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, few like Anopheles fluviatilis s. l. were susceptible to all insecticides. A disseminating trend in insecticide resistance among different anopheline mosquito vector species was evident. Metabolic and insecticide target-site resistance mechanisms were involved with organochlorines and pyrethroids, respectively. Conclusions: Insecticide resistance is becoming a severe scourge to the effectiveness of vector-borne disease management measures. This event is especially critical in developing and marginalized communities that applied chemical-based vector elimination programs for malaria; therefore, it is crucial to monitor insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Iran using biochemical and molecular tools. © 2022},

	abstract = {Introduction: Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) remains a challenging disease with debilitating symptoms and variable efficacy in terms of treatment options. Microvascular decompression (MVD) with internal neurolysis (IN) is an alternative treatment that might benefit patients but has limited understanding. We performed a systematic review of IN for the treatment of TN. Methods: Studies from 2000 to 2021 that had assessed IN for TN were aggregated and independently reviewed. Results: A total of 520 patients in 12 studies were identified, with 384 who had undergone IN (mean age, 53.8 years; range, 46–61.4 years; mean follow-up, 36.5 months). Preoperative symptoms had been present for ∼55.0 months before treatment, and pain was predominantly in V2 and V3 (26.8%), followed by other distributions. Of the patients, 83.7% (range, 72%–93.8%) had had an excellent to good outcome (Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score [BNI-PS], I–II). The pain outcomes at 1 year were excellent for 58%–78.4%, good or better for 77%–93.75%, and fair or better for 80%–93.75% of the patients. On average, facial numbness after IN was experienced by 96% of the patients. However, at follow-up, facial numbness remained in only 1.75%–10%. Most of the remaining numbness was not significantly distressing to the patients. Subgroup comparisons of IN versus recurrent MVD, IN versus radiofrequency ablation, the effects of IN in the absence of vascular compression, and IN with and without MVD were also evaluated. Conclusions: IN represents a promising surgical intervention for TN in the absence of vascular compression and for potential cases of recurrence. Complications were limited in general but require further study. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.},

	abstract = {Background: Prenatal exposures to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have been linked to reduced fetal growth. However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers underlying the association between serum PFAS and fetal growth using high-resolution metabolomics in a cohort of pregnant African American women in the Atlanta area, Georgia. Methods: Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measurements and untargeted serum metabolomics profiling were conducted in 313 pregnant African American women at 8–14 weeks gestation. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the associations of PFAS with birth weight and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. A high-resolution metabolomics workflow including metabolome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis, and chemical annotation and confirmation with a meet-in-the-middle approach was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers of the PFAS-fetal growth relationship. Results: Each log2-unit increase in serum PFNA concentration was significantly associated with higher odds of SGA birth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 1.63); similar but borderline significant associations were found in PFOA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.94, 1.49) with SGA. Among 25,516 metabolic features extracted from the serum samples, we successfully annotated and confirmed 10 overlapping metabolites associated with both PFAS and fetal growth endpoints, including glycine, taurine, uric acid, ferulic acid, 2-hexyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, unsaturated fatty acid C18:1, androgenic hormone conjugate, parent bile acid, and bile acid-glycine conjugate. Also, we identified 21 overlapping metabolic pathways from pathway enrichment analyses. These overlapping metabolites and pathways were closely related to amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism perturbations. Conclusion: In this cohort of pregnant African American women, higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were associated with reduced fetal growth. Perturbations of biological pathways involved in amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism were associated with PFAS exposures and reduced fetal growth, and uric acid was shown to be a potential intermediate biomarker. Our results provide opportunities for future studies to develop early detection and intervention for PFAS-induced fetal growth restriction. © 2021},

	abstract = {Humans are exposed to an ever-increasing number of environmental toxicants, some of which have gradually been elucidated to be important risk factors for metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and obesity. These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks. Moreover, advanced computational and prediction tools, further validation of metabolic biomarkers, as well as systematic and integrative investigations are also needed in order to reliably identify novel biomarkers and elucidate toxicity mechanisms, and to further utilize exposome and metabolome profiling in public health and safety management. © 2021},

	abstract = {Over the last years, research has focused on microbiota to establish a missing link between neuronal health and intestine imbalance. Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut–brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota–gut–brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) have been highlighted to increase animal performance and product quality. However, the effect of garlic (Allium sativum L), one of such PFAs on the internal egg quality indices of laying hens is less clear. As a result, this meta-analysis investigated the impact of garlic supplementation on egg yolk weight (EYW) and egg yolk cholesterol (EYC) content in laying hens. A search carried out in three online databases yielded five hundred and ten studies of which fifteen passed the predefined selection conditions for the meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria were information on moderator variables (hen’s age, layer strains, presentation form, treatment duration, inclusion level, and the number of hens used for the study), and outcome measures (EYW and EYC) with their corresponding measures of variance. All analyses were performed in OpenMEE software. Results indicate that addition of garlic to layer diets increased EYW by 0.063 g [95% confidence interval (CI) = 95% CI: -0.051, 0.176] compared to zero, though the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, garlic supplementation reduced EYC concentrations by 0.641 mg/g yolk (95% CI: -0.059, -0.424) in comparison with controls, taking publication bias and heterogeneity into consideration. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that modifiers had impact on the results and conclusion. In conclusion, our results suggest that garlic supplementation improved egg yolk quality parameters in laying hens. © 2022 Friends Science Publishers © 2022,International Journal of Agriculture and Biology.

	abstract = {Background: Insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residual spraying (IRS) are used to prevent malaria transmission. Both interventions use insecticides to kill mosquitoes that bite and rest indoors. Adding IRS to ITNs may improve malaria control simply because two interventions can be better than one. Furthermore, IRS may improve malaria control where ITNs are failing due to insecticide resistance. Pyrethroid insecticides are the predominant class of insecticide used for ITNs, as they are more safe than other insecticide classes when in prolonged contact with human skin. While many mosquito populations have developed some resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, a wider range of insecticides can be used for IRS. This review is an update of the previous Cochrane 2019 edition. Objectives: To summarize the effect on malaria of additionally implementing IRS, using non-pyrethroid-like or pyrethroid-like insecticides, in communities currently using ITNs. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; and five other databases for records from 1 January 2000 to 8 November 2021, on the basis that ITN programmes did not begin to be implemented as policy before the year 2000. Selection criteria: We included cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), or controlled before-after studies (CBAs) comparing IRS plus ITNs with ITNs alone. We included studies with at least 50% ITN ownership (defined as the proportion of households owning one or more ITN) in both study arms. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, analyzed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We stratified by type of insecticide, 'pyrethroid-like' and 'non-pyrethroid-like'; the latter could improve malaria control better than adding IRS insecticides that have the same way of working as the insecticide on ITNs ('pyrethroid-like'). We used subgroup analysis of ITN usage in the studies to explore heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: Eight cRCTs (10 comparisons), one CBA, and one ITS study, all conducted since 2008 in sub-Saharan Africa, met our inclusion criteria. The primary vectors in all sites were mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles gambiae s.l. complex species; five studies in Benin, Mozambique, Ghana, Sudan, and Tanzania also reported the vector Anopheles funestus. Five cRCTs and both quasi-experimental design studies used insecticides with targets different to pyrethroids (two used bendiocarb, three used pirimiphos-methyl, and one used propoxur. Each of these studies were conducted in areas where the vectors were described as resistant or highly resistant to pyrethroids. Two cRCTs used dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane (DDT), an insecticide with the same target as pyrethroids. The remaining cRCT used both types of insecticide (pyrethroid deltamethrin in the first year, switching to bendiocarb for the second year). Indoor residual spraying using 'non-pyrethroid-like' insecticides. Six studies were included (four cRCTs, one CBA, and one ITS). Our main analysis for prevalence excluded a study at high risk of bias due to repeated sampling of the same population. This risk did not apply to other outcomes. Overall, the addition of IRS reduced malaria parasite prevalence (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88; 4 cRCTs, 16,394 participants; high-certainty evidence). IRS may also reduce malaria incidence on average (rate ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.23; 4 cRCTs, 323,631 child-years; low-certainty evidence) but the effect was absent in two studies. Subgroup analyses did not explain the qualitative heterogeneity between studies. One cRCT reported no effect on malaria incidence or parasite prevalence in the first year, when a pyrethroid-like insecticide was used for IRS, but showed an effect on both outcomes in the second year, when a non-pyrethroid-like IRS was used. The addition of IRS may also reduce anaemia prevalence (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.31; 3 cRCTs, 4288 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four cRCTs reported the impact of IRS on entomological inoculation rate (EIR), with variable results; overall, we do not know if IRS had any effect on the EIR in communities using ITNs (very low-certainty evidence). Studies also reported the adult mosquito density and the sporozoite rate, but we could not summarize or pool these entomological outcomes due to differences in the reported data. Three studies measured the prevalence of pyrethroid resistance before and after IRS being introduced: there was no difference detected, but these data are limited. Indoor residual spraying using 'pyrethroid-like' insecticides. Adding IRS using a pyrethroid-like insecticide did not appear to markedly alter malaria incidence (rate ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.43; 2 cRCTs, 15,717 child-years; moderate-certainty evidence), parasite prevalence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; 3 cRCTs, 10,820 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or anaemia prevalence (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 1 cRCT, 4186 participants; low-certainty evidence). Data on EIR were limited so no conclusion was made (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: in communities using ITNs, the addition of IRS with 'non-pyrethroid-like' insecticides was associated with reduced malaria prevalence. Malaria incidence may also be reduced on average, but there was unexplained qualitative heterogeneity, and the effect may therefore not be observed in all settings. When using 'pyrethroid-like' insecticides, there was no detectable additional benefit of IRS in communities using ITNs. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {A total of 33 pesticides have been banned from Chinese medicinal materials and decoction pieces (plants) according to Chinese Pharmacopoeia (2020 edition). According to the chemical structures, they are mainly divided into seven categories: organophosphorus compounds, organochlorines, carbamates, amidines, sulfonylureas, phenylpyrazoles, and ethers. These banned pesticides exhibit neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity, immune system toxicity, teratogenicity, carcinogenesis, and mutagenesis, seriously damaging human and animal health. They affect not only the quality and safety of traditional Chinese medicines and resulting products, but also their competitiveness in the international market. Due to the numerous varieties of traditional Chinese medicines and their complex substrates, it is necessary to establish a universal and highly sensitive method for pesticide residue detection.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This meta-analysis reviews available surgical techniques for the repair of macular holes (MHs) >650 μm. MATERIAL AND METHODS: PubMed search criteria were used to identify 17 studies outlining surgical techniques for the repair of MHs >650 μm. Thirteen of the studies identified individual cases and were further analyzed based on MH classification. Success was defined as functional improvement and anatomic closure of the hole. RESULTS: Two hundred and six MHs were included in this study. There were clinically significant differences between the repair of primary and refractory MHs. Autologous retinal transplant resulted in a visual acuity improvement of -0.48 ± 0.36 logMAR, whereas an inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) flap and pedicle ILM flap resulted in visual acuity improvements of -0.15 ± 0.17 and -0.14 ± 0.91 logMAR, respectively. CONCLUSION: An inverted or pedicle ILM flap appears more effective for primary MHs, whereas refractory MHs benefit from a free flap. © Ophthalmic Surgery, Lasers & Imaging Retina},

	abstract = {Preterm birth is the second most common cause of death in children under 5 years of age. The etiology of preterm birth has not yet been elucidated. Although maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk for preterm birth, associations have not been confirmed. We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationships between maternal exposure to EDCs and preterm birth. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies providing quantitative data on the association between maternal EDC exposure and preterm birth in humans was conducted in July 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. A total of 59 studies were included. The pooled results indicated that maternal exposure to metals (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29) and phthalates (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.42) was related to an increased risk for preterm birth. Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth. In conclusion, maternal exposure to metals and phthalates may increase the risk for preterm birth based on current evidence. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Microbial communities inhabiting soil-water-sediment continuum in coastal areas provide important ecosystem services. Their adaptation in response to environmental stressors, particularly mitigating the impact of pollutants discharged from human activities, has been considered for the development of microbial biomonitoring tools, but their use is still in the infancy. Here, chemical and molecular (16S rRNA gene metabarcoding) approaches were combined in order to determine the impact of pollutants on microbial assemblages inhabiting the aquatic network of a soil-water-sediment continuum around the Ichkeul Lake (Tunisia), an area highly impacted by human activities. Samples were collected within the soil-river-lake continuum at three stations in dry (summer) and wet (winter) seasons. The contaminant pressure index (PI), which integrates Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkanes, Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and metal contents, and the microbial pressure index microgAMBI, based on bacterial community structure, showed significant correlation with contamination level and differences between seasons. The comparison of prokaryotic communities further revealed specific assemblages for soil, river and lake sediments. Correlation analyses identified potential “specialist” genera for the different compartments, whose abundances were correlated with the pollutant type found. Additionally, PICRUSt analysis revealed the metabolic potential for pollutant transformation or degradation of the identified “specialist” species, providing information to estimate the recovery capacity of the ecosystem. Such findings offer the possibility to define a relevant set of microbial indicators for assessing the effects of human activities on aquatic ecosystems. Microbial indicators, including the detection of “specialist” and sensitive taxa, and their functional capacity, might be useful, in combination with integrative microbial indices, to constitute accurate biomonitoring tools for the management and restoration of complex coastal aquatic systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Perfluoropolyethers (PFPE) is a kind of high performance synthetic lubricant with low volatility, high thermal and oxidation stability, good chemical inertia and insulation performance, as well as a wide range of liquid temperature and excellent viscosity-temperature characteristics. PFPE has been widely used in aerospace, military, nuclear industry, computer disk and other fields. With the rapid development of industrial technology, new requirements have been proposed for the performance of the lubricants. As a result, the common perfluoropolyethers as lubricants gradually cannot work well under the present working conditions. Moreover, it is difficult to improve the lubrication performance of perfluoropolyethers by conventional additives technology due to their poor compatibility with conventional additives. Hence, in order to improve the antifriction and antiwear properties of perfluoropolyethers, researchers focused on modifying their structures. Great efforts have been paid to improve the performance of perfluoropolyethers as lubrication film in the field of computer disk, but as a kind of important aviation lubricating oils, their lubrication performances are also in urgent need of improvement. In this context, in this study three kinds of perfluoropolyether carboxylate ammonium ionic liquids (PF-BA, PF-DBA and PF-TBA) were designed and synthesized by modifying the structure of perfluoropolyether carboxylic acid (PFPEC) with different amines. The structures of synthesized ionic liquids were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Their shear stress and viscosity at different shear rates were evaluated by a Rheometer, and the wetting ability on metal surfaces were analyzed by the contact angle. Their lubrication performance for steel/steel and steel/tin bronze friction pairs at 25 ℃ and 100 ℃ were evaluated and compared by Optimal SRV-V oscillating friction and wear tester, where PFPE and PFPEC were used as reference samples. And the variation of the tribofilm during the friction process were revealed by the change of contact resistance. The surface morphologies and element state were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. Tribochemical reactions were investigated by comparing the change in surface morphologies and element state of wear spot. By combining the above results, the lubrication mechanism was explored. Results showed that all the synthesized ionic liquids exhibited higher shear stress and viscosity than PFPEC. Specifically, the ionic liquids with more N-H bonds in the cation exhibited higher viscosity and shear stress, possibly due to the formation of hydrogen bond that can increase the intermolecular interactions. The viscosity and shear stress gradually decreased with the increase of shear rate, while the viscosity of the ionic liquids with more N-H bond in the cation decreased more rapidly. On the surface of tin bronze, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting performance than PFPEC, but poorer than PFPE. While on the steel surface, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting abilities than PFPEC and PFPE. As lubricants for steel/tin bronze friction pairs, the friction coefficients and wear volumes of the three ionic liquids were close to those of PFPE and PFPEC at room temperature, and their lubrication performance was improved insignificantly. The synthesized ionic liquids exhibited much better anti-friction and anti-wear performance at high temperature (100 ℃) than PFPE and PFPEC. As lubricants for steel/steel friction pairs at room temperature, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were similar to that of PFPEC, and even a little higher than PFPE; while the wear volumes decreased about 60%-70% in comparison with PFPE and PFPEC. At 100 ℃, compared with PFPE and PFPEC, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were much more stable and lower, and the wear volumes were reduced by 70% ~ 80%. Summarily, three synthesized ionic liquids had better friction-reduction and anti-wear properties than that of PFPE and PFPEC both at room temperature and at high temperature as lubricants for steel/steel friction pair. The contact resistances reflected the variation of the tribofilm, i.e. the higher contact resistance, the thicker tribofilm and better lubricating properties. The results of tested contact resistances were consistent with the friction tests results. According to the SEM morphologies of the worn surface lubricated by different lubricants, both the tin bronze and steel worn surfaces exhibited abrasive wear. Among them, the worn surfaces lubricated by ionic liquids PF-TBA were the smoother, and the parallel grooves were the shallower both at room temperature and high temperature. The steel worn surfaces lubricated by the three ionic liquids were much smoother than that of PEPE and PEPEC. From the XPS results, it can be seen that the composition and content of the friction films on the worn surface lubricated by the three synthesized ionic liquids were different from that of PEPEC. The tribofilm formed on the steel surfaces lubricated by the ionic liquids was consisted of Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and FeF3, the nitrogen-containing compounds and adsorbed ionic liquids. The adsorption film of the ionic liquids on the metal surface was strong and the tribofilm was thick. The combined results of multiple physical and chemical analysis showed that the excellent friction-reduction and anti-wear properties of synthesized ionic liquids can be attributed to their excellent adsorption properties on the metal surface and the formation of stable tribofilm.

	abstract = {Microplastics (MPs, < 5 mm) in the environment have attracted worldwide attention due to their wide distribution and difficulty in handling. Aging processes such as UV irradiation, biodegradation, physical abrasion and chemical oxidation can affect the environmental behavior of MPs. This review article summarizes different aging processes of MPs and subsequent effects on the adsorption of pollutants, the leaching of additives, and the toxicity of MPs. In addition, the formation process of biofilm on the surface of MPs and the interactions between biofilm and aged MPs are revealed. MPs can accumulate different environmental pollutants (organic pollutants, heavy metals, microorganisms, etc.) through surface adsorption, pore filling and distribution. Moreover, the aging of MPs affects their adsorption performance toward these pollutants due to a series of changes in their specific surface area and oxygen-containing functional groups. The release of some toxic additives such as phthalates after aging can enhance the toxic effects of MPs. Aging also changes the shape and size of MPs, which can affect the eating habits of the organisms and further increase the potential toxicity of MPs. This article conducts a systematical analysis and summary of the environmental behavior and physicochemical properties of MPs as well as the changes due to MPs aging, which helps to better understand the impact of aging on MPs in the environment. Future research on MPs aging should reduce the knowledge gap between laboratory simulation and actual conditions and increase the environmental relevance. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Increasing chemical pollution of aquatic environments is a growing concern with global relevance. A large number of organic chemicals are termed as “micropollutants” due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer. © 2021 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), together with 11 other organic compounds, were initially listed as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) by the Stockholm Convention because of their potential threat to ecosystems and humans. In China, many monitoring studies have been undertaken to reveal the level of PCBs in environment since 2005 due to the introduced stricter environmental regulations. However, there are still significant gaps in understanding the overall spatial and temporal distributions of PCBs in China. This review systematically discusses the occurrence and distribution of PCBs in environmental matrices, organisms, and humans in China. Results showed that PCB contamination in northern and southern China was not significantly different, but the PCB levels in East China were commonly higher than those in West China, which might have been due to the widespread consumption of PCBs and intensive human activities in East China. Serious PCB contamination was found in e-waste disassembling areas (e.g., Taizhou of Zhejiang Province and Qingyuan and Guiyu of Guangdong Province). Higher PCB concentrations were also chronicled in megalopolises and industrial clusters. The unintentionally produced PCBs (UP-PCBs) formed during industrial thermal processes may play an increasingly significant role in PCB pollution in China. Low PCB levels were recorded in rural and underdeveloped districts, particularly in remote and high-altitude localities such as the Tibetan Plateau and the South China Sea. However, these data are limited. Human exposure to PCBs is closely related to the characteristics of environmental pollution. This review also discusses existing issues and future research prospects on PCBs in China. For instance, the accumulation characteristics and migration regularities of PCBs in food webs should be further studied. More investigations should be undertaken to assess the quantitative relationship between external and internal exposure to PCBs. For example, bioaccessibility and bioavailability studies should be supplemented to evaluate human health risks more accurately. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

The current scenario of emerging recalcitrant pollutants in the environment is encountered using various remediation approaches are enforced and applied. The need for mineralization of the toxic pollutants to non - toxic forms accomplished the application of microbes (bacteria, fungi and algae) and plants individually or in a combined manner. The current research on the removal of pollutants from synthetic textile wastewater containing 1200 ppm concentration of mixed azo dyes –Reactive red (RR), Reactive Brown (RB) & Reactive Black (RBl) and 300 ppm Cr (VI) metal using haloalkaliphilic bacterial strains LBKVG1, LBKVG2, LBKVG3 & LBKVG4 in a Moving Bed Biofilm Reactor (MBBR), showed decolorization of 82 ± 0.5% of mixed azo dyes and degradation 56 ± 0.5% of Cr (VI) metal at 37 °C and pH 8.5 in the fifth day of the study. The isolated bacterial strains in the consortium were molecularly and morphologically characterized by 16SrRNA sequencing and SEM analysis.

	abstract = {Over the last few decades, the global prevalence of neurodevelopmental and neurodegenerative illnesses has risen rapidly. Although the aetiology remains unclear, evidence is mounting that exposure to persistent hydrocarbon pollutants is a substantial risk factor, predisposing a person to neurological diseases later in life. Epidemiological studies correlate environmental hydrocarbon exposure to brain disorders including neuropathies, cognitive, motor and sensory impairments; neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Particulate matter, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and endocrine-disrupting chemicals have all been linked to neurodevelopmental problems in all class of people. There is mounting evidence that supports the prevalence of petroleum hydrocarbon becoming neurotoxic and being involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. More study is needed to fully comprehend the scope of these problems in the context of unconventional oil and natural gas. This review summarises in vitro, animal and epidemiological research on the genesis of neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting evidence that supports inexorable role of hazardous hydrocarbon exposure in the pathophysiology of AD and PD. In this review, we offer a summary of the existing evidence gathered through a Medline literature search of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of the most important epidemiological studies published so far. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.},

The degradation efficiency of the sonochemical systems, the influence of the nature of the pollutant (volatile, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic character), matrix effects (enhancement or detrimental ability compared to pure water), and the role of the contaminant concentration were considered. The combinations of ultrasound with other degradation processes, to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the sonochemical process, were considered. Also, energy consumptions and energy costs associated with pollutants degradation in the target matrices were estimated. Moreover, the gaps that should be developed in future works, on the sonodegradation of organic contaminants in mineral water, seawater, and urine, were discussed. © 2021},

	abstract = {Nowadays, water scarcity is an identifiable problem facing society. However, as a result of modernization, water consumption is dramatically in increase although the water supply remains constant. Unfortunately every sector consumes water resulting in massive amounts of wastewater that requires treatment prior to their final disposal that still a challenge to the modern societies. Among the various technologies investigated, adsorption considered the most widely applied technology for safe environmental remediation. In this regard, the term of green adsorbents is introduced that is meant the low-cost materials originated from waste, i.e., agriculture waste to be valuable adsorbents. Thus, extensive list of different adsorbents from natural, industrial waste, agriculture bio-products or modified materials have been applied for the elimination of various contaminants from aqueous matrix are compiled here as a demanding area since it has double benefits as an industrial ecology approach. Also, this article discusses the basic principles of adsorption process including the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Although numerous review articles are dealing with low-cost adsorption performances, there is insufficient information on the emerging pollutants elimination. The major focus of this work is highlighting the research on the application of the low-cost adsorbents on the emerging pollutants, namely, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and perfluorinated compounds. Scattered information on using various adsorbents are provided information in adsorbing emerging pollutants uptake reached to 920 mg/g. The main parameters that affect the adsorption process and the economic prospective is also discussed. Desorption and recycling scenario is concluded and desorption efficiency could reach to 99%.

	abstract = {Polycystic ovary syndrome is the most common endocrine disorder in women of reproductive age, which is still incurable. However, the symptoms can be successfully managed with proper medication and lifestyle interventions. Despite its prevalence, little is known about its etiology. In this review article, the up-to-date diagnostic features and parameters recommended on the grounds of evidence-based data and different guidelines are explored. The ambiguity and insufficiency of data when diagnosing adolescent women have been put under special focus. We look at some of the most recent research done to establish relationships between different gene polymorphisms with polycystic ovary syndrome in various populations along with the underestimated impact of environmental factors like endocrine-disrupting chemicals on the reproductive health of these women. Furthermore, the article concludes with existing treatments options and the scopes for advancement in the near future. Various therapies have been considered as potential treatment through multiple randomized controlled studies, and clinical trials conducted over the years are described in this article. Standard therapies ranging from metformin to newly found alternatives based on vitamin D and gut microbiota could shine some light and guidance toward a permanent cure for this female reproductive health issue in the future. © The Author(s) 2022.},

	abstract = {The increase in pesticide consumption has a negative health impact. Studies point to an association between exposure to pesticides and cardiovascular disease (CVD), one of the leading causes of world mortality. This review synthesize evidence on the association between occupational exposure and environmental contamination by pesticides with CVDs from 1750 references databases (EBSCO, Medline, Science Direct, Scielo, Lilacs and Ovid) without date or language restriction. Selected 24 articles by PRISMA and Downs & Black methodologies, were included from inclusion criteria: original studies (case-control, cohort or cross-sectional design); clear CVD definition and exposure to pesticides; representative sample of the target population. The results show the occupational exposure to pesticides chlorpyrifos, coumafos, carbofuran, ethylene bromide, mancozeb, ziram, metalaxyl, pendimethalin and trifluralin was associated a risk of 1.8 to 3.2 for acute myocardial infarction. Primaphos, fenitrothion, malathion and deltamethrin pesticides were associated with a blood pressure increase. Environmental contamination by tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was associated with CVD with risk of 1.09 to 2.78 and organochlorine, 1.19 to 4.54; heavy metals, arsenic, trimethylarsine and dimethylarsinic acid with atherosclerosis and systemic arterial hypertension. These findings point to the association between exposure to pesticides and CVD, signaling the importance of greater rigor in the public policy related to pesticides. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Context: Di-2-ethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), a known persistent organic pollutant, can increase the sperm DNA fragmentation index (DFI). Objective: To investigate the mechanism underlying the repair of DEHP-induced sperm DNA damage in mice by Wuwei Fuzheng Yijing (WFY) formula. Materials and methods: The potential targets of WFY and sperm DNA fragment (SDF) were obtained from the TCMSP, BATMAN-TCM, OMIM and GeneCards. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, GO and KEGG pathway analyses of WFY-SDF were constructed. An animal model of DEHP-induced sperm DNA damage was replicated by gavage of SPF ICR (CD1) mice DEHP at 1 g/kg/d and treated with WFY at 8.92, 17.84 and 35.67 g/kg, respectively, for 60 d. Sperm DFI of each group was detected and compared. The target genes of WFY identified by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were validated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Results: Network pharmacology pathway analysis indicated that PI3K/Akt was the potential target of WFY on SDF. The DFI of the DEHP group (25.48%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (4.02%). The high-dose WFY group (19.05%) exhibited the most significant repairing effect. The related pathways were PI3K/Akt and metabolic. Aass, Aldh1a7, GSTA3, betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (Bhmt), Mug2 and Svs1 were screened and Bhmt was validated. Discussion and conclusions: WFY can repair sperm DNA damage caused by DEHP, and the mechanism may be related to PI3K/Akt and metabolic pathways, and Bhmt. This provides a new direction for using traditional Chinese medicine to prevent and repair reproductive system injury caused by pollutants. © 2022 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Background: Pediculosis capitis is a common human parasitic infestation in childhood. This article aims to provide a narrative updated review on the management of pediculosis capitis. Methods: A PubMed search was performed with Clinical Queries using the key terms "pediculosis capitis" OR "head lice" OR "head louse". The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and reviews published within the past 10 years. The search was restricted to articles published in English literature. The information retrieved from the search was used in the compilation of the present article. Results: Topical permethrin and pyrethrin formulated with piperonyl butoxide are the pediculicides of choice in areas where resistance to these products is low. When resistance to these products is suspected based on local levels of resistance or when treatment with these products fails despite their correct use, and reinfestation does not seem to be responsible, other topical treatment options include malathion, benzyl alcohol, dimethicone, spinosad and ivermectin. Wet combing should be considered for children younger than 2 years. Oral ivermectin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be reserved for patients who do not respond to appropriate topical pediculicides. Conclusion: Many topical pediculicides are effective for the treatment of pediculosis capitis. The use of some of these pediculicides is limited for safety reasons, especially in children younger than 2 years. Resistance to pediculicides, especially those with a neurotoxic mode of action, is another concern which may limit the use of some of these pediculicides. New products should be evaluated for effectiveness and safety. Wet combing is time-consuming and should not be used as the sole intervention in the general population. © 2022 Bioexcel Publishing LTD.

	abstract = {Background Social and behavioural drivers of inappropriate antibiotic use contribute to antimicrobial resistance (AMR). Recent reports indicate the Australian community consumes more than twice the defined daily doses (DDD) of antibiotics per 1000 population than in Sweden, and about 20% more than in the United Kingdom (UK). We compare measures of public knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surrounding AMR in Australia, the UK and Sweden against the policy approaches taken in these settings to address inappropriate antibiotic use. Methods National antimicrobial stewardship policies in Australia, Sweden, and the UK were reviewed, supplemented by empirical studies of their effectiveness. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL databases for primary studies of the general public's KAP around antibiotic use and AMR in each setting (January 1 2011 until July 30 2021). Where feasible, we meta-analysed data on the proportion of participants agreeing with identical or very similar survey questions, using a random effects model. Results Policies in Sweden enact tighter control of community antibiotic use; reducing antibiotic use through public awareness raising is not a priority. Policies in the UK and Australia are more reliant on practitioner and public education to encourage appropriate antibiotic use. 26 KAP were included in the review and 16 were meta-analysable. KAP respondents in Australia and the UK are consistently more likely to report beliefs and behaviours that are not aligned with appropriate antibiotic use, compared to participants in similar studies conducted in Sweden. Conclusions Interactions between public knowledge, attitudes and their impacts on behaviours surrounding community use of antibiotics are complex and contingent. Despite a greater focus on raising public awareness in Australia and the UK, neither antibiotic consumption nor community knowledge and attitudes are changing significantly. Clearly public education campaigns can contribute to mitigating AMR. However, the relative success of policy approaches taken in Sweden suggests that practice level interventions may also be required to activate prescribers and the communities they serve to make substantive reductions in inappropriate antibiotic use.

	abstract = {Background: Bisphenol A (BPA), an important industrial material widely applied in daily products, is considered an endocrine-disrupting chemical that may adversely affect humans. Grow-ing evidence has shown that intestinal bacterial alterations caused by BPA exposure play an important role in several local and systemic diseases. Aims: finding evidence that BPA-induced alterations in gut microbiota composition and activity may perturb its role on human health. Results: Evidence from several experimental settings shows that both low and high doses of BPA in-terfere with the hormonal, homeostatic, and reproductive systems in animals and humans. Moreover, it has recently been classified as an environmental obesogenic, with metabolic-disrupting effects on lipid metabolism and pancreatic b-cell functions. Several evidence characterizes PBA as an environmental contributor to type II diabetes, metabolic syndromes, and obesity. However, the highest estimates of the exposure derived from foods alone or in combination with other sources are 3 to 5 times below the new tolerable daily intake (TDI) value, today reduced by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) experts from 50 micrograms per kilogramme of bodyweight per day (µg/kg bw/day) to 4 µg/kg bw/day. Conclusion: Considering estimates for the total amount of BPA that can be ingested daily over a lifetime, many International Health Authorities conclude that dietary exposure of adult humans to BPA does not represent a risk to consumers' health, declaring its safety due to very-low established levels in food and water and any appreciable health risk. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.},

	abstract = {Background: Experimental evidence suggests that p,p'-DDE might be involved in the development of diabetes and hypertension (HTN); however, the evidence in humans is inconclusive. Objective: To summarize the epidemiological evidence for the association of p,p'-DDT exposure and its breakdown products with the risk of diabetes and HTN from prospective studies. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Eligible studies (prospective) were search in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and SciELO databases (July 11, 2020). Different search algorithms were used for diabetes and HTN. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated from meta-analysis with random effects for each exposure and outcome. Results: A total of 23 prospective studies were included in this review, 16 assessed diabetes and seven HTN; very few measured p,p'-DDT. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was associated with a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (pooled OR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.00, 2.07; p = 0.049) and HTN (pooled OR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.38). Dose-response meta-analysis suggested a non-linear relation between p,p'-DDE and T2D. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was not associated with gestational diabetes (pooled OR = 1.01; 95%CI: 0.94, 1.09); similarly, p,p'-DDT was not associated with T2D (pooled OR = 1.03; 95%CI: 0.79, 1.35). Conclusions: Evidence from prospective studies suggests that exposure to p,p'-DDE, the main breakdown product of p,p'-DDT, might increase the risk of developing T2D; such increase may be apparent only at low levels. Exposure to p,p'-DDE may also increase the risk of having HTN; however, further evidence is required. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH},

	abstract = {In patients with kidney graft neoplasms, the treatment of choice is still represented by surgical approach, mainly based on partial nephrectomy/nephron sparing surgery (NSS). In this oncologic setting, focal treatments (FT) are becoming more and more useful to avoid the risk of dialysis, considering graft viability of utmost importance. There is still little evidence on which is the best FT option in kidney graft neoplasms and on its therapeutic indications. We performed a systematic review to assess the role of FT such as thermal ablation, interventional radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy, as alternative to NSS in the treatment of Stage I kidney cancer. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published between 2010 and 2020 focusing on kidney transplant recipients with kidney graft neoplasm who had undergone FT. The review is framed by the population, intervention, control, and outcomes criteria. The studies underlined safety and efficacy of FT, with low morbidity and good graft survival, but none of them provided a direct comparison with graft nephrectomy or NSS. There is still no clear evidence that FTs, and percutaneous ones in particular, are indicated as a standard treatment in kidney graft neoplasms as opposed to total or partial graft nephrectomy. © 2022, Turkish Society for Radiation Oncology.},

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a class of structurally diverse synthetic organic chemicals that are chemically stable, resistant to degradation, and persistent in terrestrial and aquatic environments. Widespread use of PFAS in industrial processing and manufacturing over the last 70 years has led to global contamination of built and natural environments. The brain is a lipid rich and highly vascularized organ composed of long-lived neurons and glial cells that are especially vulnerable to the impacts of persistent and lipophilic toxicants. Generally, PFAS partition to protein-rich tissues of the body, primarily the liver and blood, but are also detected in the brains of humans, wildlife, and laboratory animals. Here we review factors impacting the absorption, distribution, and accumulation of PFAS in the brain, and currently available evidence for neurotoxic impacts defined by disruption of neurochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioral endpoints. Emphasis is placed on the neurotoxic potential of exposures during critical periods of development and in sensitive populations, and factors that may exacerbate neurotoxicity of PFAS. While limitations and inconsistencies across studies exist, the available body of evidence suggests that the neurobehavioral impacts of long-chain PFAS exposures during development are more pronounced than impacts resulting from exposure during adulthood. There is a paucity of experimental studies evaluating neurobehavioral and molecular mechanisms of short-chain PFAS, and even greater data gaps in the analysis of neurotoxicity for PFAS outside of the perfluoroalkyl acids. Whereas most experimental studies were focused on acute and subchronic impacts resulting from high dose exposures to a single PFAS congener, more realistic exposures for humans and wildlife are mixtures exposures that are relatively chronic and low dose in nature. Our evaluation of the available human epidemiological, experimental, and wildlife data also indicates heightened accumulation of perfluoroalkyl acids in the brain after environmental exposure, in comparison to the experimental studies. These findings highlight the need for additional experimental analysis of neurodevelopmental impacts of environmentally relevant concentrations and complex mixtures of PFAS.

	abstract = {Global sperm counts have declined in recent decades, coinciding with the proliferation of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, of which pesticides are some of the most common. Previous systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies published between 1991 through 2013 have reported associations between environmental and occupational pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality, particularly associations with reduced sperm concentration. This systematic review used the Navigation Guide to critically evaluate the current body of evidence examining sperm quality and pesticide exposure in epidemiological studies. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for all English-language articles published after September 2012 until August 2021. Original observational studies that assessed human sperm quality parameters, defined as concentration, motility, morphology, and DNA integrity, and individual-level pesticide exposure were included. The risk of bias for each included study and the strength of evidence were evaluated using the Navigation Guide protocol. Nineteen studies assessing environmental or occupational pesticide exposure and sperm parameters were included. Eighteen studies were cross-sectional studies and one prospective cohort; sample sizes ranged from 42 to 2122 men from 14 different countries. Fifteen (79 %) studies found at least one significant association between pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality. The overall risk of bias across studies was classified as low to moderate. The quality of evidence was determined to be moderate based on systematic evaluation criteria. There were consistent adverse associations between pesticide exposure and sperm motility (63 % of studies) and DNA integrity (80 % of studies). For sperm concentration and morphology, 42 % and 36 % of studies found significant negative associations, respectively. The strength of the body of evidence overall was rated as having sufficient evidence of toxicity. Regarding specific sperm endpoints, there was sufficient evidence that pesticides are toxic for sperm motility and DNA integrity; limited evidence of toxicity for sperm concentration; and inadequate evidence of toxicity for sperm morphology. The studies reviewed here showed consistent associations between pesticide exposure and diminished sperm parameters, particularly sperm motility and sperm DNA integrity. These findings are largely consistent with results of previous reviews, which have found significant negative associations between pesticide exposure and sperm quality in 13 of 20 (65 %) studies published between 1991 and 2008, and in 14 of 17 (82 %) studies published between 2008 and 2012. After thirty years of mounting evidence, actions are needed to reduce pesticide risks to testicular function and male fertility. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {To simulate the real cell status and morphology in the living systems is substantial for using cell models to address the detrimental effects of toxic contaminants. In this study, the comparative profiles of metabolites in three-dimensional (3D) human normal liver (L-02) cell spheroids with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) treatment were analyzed using a metabolomic approach. The uniform 3D cell spheroids were well formed in 3 days (e.g., sphericity index >0.9) and stably maintained over the subsequent 11 days. The cytotoxicity of PFOA to the 3D L-02 cell spheroids was highly dependent on both exposure concentration and duration. Comparative analysis of metabolomes showed that the number of differential metabolites in the 3D cell spheroids treated with 300 μM PFOA for 10 days (n = 59) was greater than those with a 4-day exposure to 300 μM PFOA (n = 17). Six metabolic pathways related to amino acids metabolism were only found in the 3D cell spheroids with a 10-day treatment of 300 μM PFOA, which could not be found in the 2D monolayer cells and those 3D cell spheroids with a 4-day exposure. The suppression of PFOA on glutamine metabolism substantially decreased glutathione (GSH) production and accordingly increased the level of reactive oxygen species in the 3D cell spheroids. On the contrary, the supplementation of glutamine increased GSH production and the viability of cell spheroids, indicating that glutamine metabolism played a critical role in the chronic toxic effects of PFOA. Our study strongly suggested that comprehensive toxicological methodologies based on the 3D cell models could currently be robust and suitable for addressing the chronic adverse effects of toxic contaminants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, China Biomedical Literature Service, CNCNKI, and Wanfang database were computerized to collect all case-control studies on the association between variety classes and different concentrations of environmental pollutant gas to fetal of prolonged bradycardia. After evaluating the quality of the inclusion study and extracting valid data, meta-analysis was performed using Stata15 software. Relative hazards were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method and the random effect model, and P values and I2 values were used for heterogeneity evaluation. When heterogeneity occurs, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the sources. Results. A total of 15 studies were included, including 1202 patients with fetal of prolonged bradycardia and 1380 in the control population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in PCP < 0.1 mg/L between the experimental group and control group (OR = 1.03, 95% CI (0.62, 1.72), P=0.90, I2 = 0%, Z = 0.13), but there was a statistical difference in PCP > 5 mg/L (OR = 1.73, 95% CI (1.15, 2.58), P=0.008, I2 = 0%, Z = 2.65), PCP > 10 mg/L (OR = 1.75, 95% CI (1.19, 2.57), P=0.004, I2 = 14%, Z = 2.85), and PCP >15 mg/L (OR = 2.02, 95% CI (1.38, 2.95), P=0.0003, I2 = 77%, Z = 3.61).

	abstract = {Background: The application of insecticides for malaria vector control has led to a global problem, which is the current trend of increased resistance against these chemicals. This study aimed to review the insecticide resistance status was previously determined in Asia and how to implement the necessary interventions. Moreover, the implications of resistance in malaria vector control in this region were studied. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using a predefined protocol based on PRISMA-retrieved articles from four science databases, namely ProQuest, Science Direct, EBSCO, and PubMed in the last ten years (2009 to 2019). The searching process utilized four main combinations of the following keywords: malaria, vector control, insecticide, and Asia. In ProQuest, malaria control, as well as an insecticide, were used as keywords. The following criteria were included in the filter, namely full text, the source of each article, scholarly journal, Asia, and publication date as in the last ten years. Results: There were 1408 articles retrieved during the initial search (ProQuest=722, Science Direct=267, EBSCO=50, PubMed=285, and Scopus=84). During the screening, 27 articles were excluded because of duplication, 1361 based on title and abstract incompatibility with the inclusion criteria, and 20 due to content differences. In the final screening process, 15 articles were chosen to be analyzed. From the 15 articles, it is known that there was organochlorine (DDT), organophosphate (malathion), and pyrethroids resistance in several Anopheles species with a less than 80% mortality rate. Conclusion: This review found multiple resistance in several Anopheles includes resistance to pyrethroid. The reports of pyrethroid resistance were quite challenging because it is considered effective in the malaria vector control. Several countries in Asia are implementing an insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy against malaria vectors following the Global Plan for IRM. © 2022 Susanna D and Pratiwi D.},

The complex interactions that occur between synthetic MPs polymers and hydrophobic toxic compounds, metals, additives, and other emergent contaminants complicates the standardization of techniques used for the extraction and quantitation of these chemicals. Organic compounds are extracted from MPs by soaking, sonication, and the use of microwave, Soxhlet and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) techniques in a variety of polar and nonpolar solvents. The extracts are cleaned up through solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) using an assortment of detectors. The analysis of metals from MPs is more standardized, usually with extraction in 20% aqua regia and analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (ICP-MS). Published papers do not consistently report the use of standards, detection levels, and other quality control measures. This chapter provides a summary of research on the chemical analysis of toxic compounds sorbed to and leached from MPs in order to better understand the chemical processes and help advance the harmonization of chemical analysis of MPs and their associated contaminants. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.},

	abstract = {The generation and dumping of electronic (e)-waste are one of the greatest global crises that developing countries are facing. e-waste largely consists of electrical and electronic tools and is considered a source of different types of heavy and precious metals and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) which are reported to cause severe health and environmental impacts. Although there exist different policies related to E-waste management, its recycling is done mainly by unorganized sectors which leads to the release of toxic leachates and acid in the soils. Microbial communities thriving in waste-waste contaminated sites have been the center of research interest for a long. These communities thriving in e-waste contaminated sites have developed resistance mechanisms to heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. These microbe-mediated bioremediation techniques may serve as an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to the traditional way of treatment. In this present chapter, we have tried to highlight the different types of indigenous microbes thriving in soils of e-waste contaminated lands and have emphasized the role of microbes in the bioremediation of the e-waste. Moreover, the recovery of valuable resource materials and metals from e-waste following environment-friendly processes has also been discussed in detail. © 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {As emerging pollutants, microplastics (MPs) are widely distributed in water, soil and atmosphere, and have become a popularly concerned environmental and social issue. The research on atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and water, but AMPs’ potential environmental impacts are explored in an even wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m–2 d–1 or 0 to 1583 n m–3. The distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the diversity of AMPs’ shape and composition are higher in the places near to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What’s noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs’ transport path is mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality, change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport, resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs’ environmental behaviors, the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and environmental and ecological impacts. It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to study the physiological and ecological status of human body and ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution. © 2022 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

	abstract = {Fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is a major air pollutant worldwide. Characterizing its chemical compositions and source contributions is a critical prerequisite for effective control of PM2.5 pollution. This paper systematically reviews the sampling methods, chemical compositions, and source apportionments of PM2.5. Sampling methods have significant influences on the identification of chemical compositions and source contributions, with Quartz and Teflon filters being the most widely used. Receptor models are commonly adopted for identifying the sources of PM2.5, such as positive matrix factorization, chemical mass balance, principal component analysis, and UNMIX models, which have their respective advantages and limitations that determine their applications. The variations of PM2.5 compositions and sources in the past two decades in Beijing are also reviewed, which is the political, economic, and cultural center of China and is experiencing severe haze pollution events frequently. It was found that organic matters were the largest component (28.2%) in PM2.5, followed by sulfate (15.1%) during 2004–2013, which was overtaken by nitrate (14.9%) after 2013. Each PM2.5 source demonstrated significant seasonal and annual variations due to changes in climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities. Future research on the impacts of these external factors is urgently needed. This review is expected to provide valuable advice and evidence for those fast-growing megacities like Beijing to identify and control their PM2.5-related air pollution problems. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {The dairy industry produces vast quantities of dairy processing sludge (DPS), which can be processed further to develop second generation products such as struvite, biochars and ashes (collectively known as STRUBIAS). These bio-based fertilizers have heterogeneous nutrient and metal contents, resulting in a range of possible application rates. To avoid nutrient losses to water or bioaccumulation of metals in soil or crops, it is important that rates applied to land are safe and adhere to the maximum legal application rates similar to inorganic fertilizers. This study collected and analysed nutrient and metal content of all major DPS (n = 84) and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products (n = 10), and created an application calculator in MS Excel™ to provide guidance on maximum legal application rates for ryegrass and spring wheat across plant available phosphorus (P) deficient soil to P-excess soil. The sample analysis showed that raw DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS have high P contents ranging from 10.1 to 122 g kg−1. Nitrogen (N) in DPS was high, whereas N concentrations decreased in thermo-chemical STRUBIAS products (chars and ash) due to the high temperatures used in their formation. The heavy metal content of DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS was significantly lower than the EU imposed limits. Using the calculator, application rates of DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS materials (dry weight) ranged from 0 to 4.0 tonnes ha−1 y−1 for ryegrass and 0–4.5 tonnes ha−1 y−1 for spring wheat. The estimated heavy metal ingestion to soil annually by the application of the DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products was lower than the EU guideline on soil metal accumulation. The calculator is adaptable for any bio-based fertilizer, soil and crop type, and future work should continue to characterise and incorporate new DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products into the database presented in this paper. In addition, safe application rates pertaining to other regulated pollutants or emerging contaminants that may be identified in these products should be included. The fertilizer replacement value of these products, taken from long-term field studies, should be factored into application rates. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Epidemiological studies, which can have inherent methodological limitations, are used to study the relation between endocrine disrupting chemicals and autism spectrum disorder. The objective is to systematically review the treatment of methodological limitations and assess the quality and strength of the findings in the available literature. The quality and strength of the evidence were evaluated using the Navigation Guide Systematic Review Methodology. The overall quality and strength of the available studies were “moderate” and “limited,” respectively. Risk of bias due to the methodological limitations regarding the exclusion of potential confounding factors and the lack of accuracy of exposure assessment methods were the most prevalent and were also considered to arrive at these results. The omnipresence of endocrine disrupting chemicals, their persistence and bioaccumulation, and the biological plausibility of the association between prenatal exposure to these and later development of autism spectrum disorder highlight the need to carry out well-designed epidemiological studies that overcome the methodological limitations observed in the currently available literature in order to be able to inform public policy to prevent exposure to these potentially harmful chemicals. Lay abstract: Autism spectrum disorders comprise a complex group with many subtypes of behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental abnormalities in two core areas: deficits in social communication and fixated, restricted, repetitive, or stereotyped behaviors and interests each with potential unique risk factors and characteristics. The underlying mechanisms and the possible causes of autism spectrum disorder remain elusive and while increased prevalence is undoubtable, it is unclear if it is a reflection of diagnostic improvement or emerging risk factors such as endocrine disrupting chemicals. Epidemiological studies, which are used to study the relation between endocrine disrupting chemicals and autism spectrum disorder, can have inherent methodological challenges that limit the quality and strength of their findings. The objective of this work is to systematically review the treatment of these challenges and assess the quality and strength of the findings in the currently available literature. The overall quality and strength were “moderate” and “limited,” respectively. Risk of bias due to the exclusion of potential confounding factors and the lack of accuracy of exposure assessment methods were the most prevalent.

	abstract = {We present a comprehensive review of the sediment quality triad (SQT) assessment studies in Korea. The bibliographic analysis was applied to evaluate how approaches in sediment assessment have evolved. A meta-analysis was performed, to evaluate potential risks of sedimentary persistent toxic substances (PTSs) reported in Korean coastal waters. Within the framework, we identified and discussed current status and spatiotemporal trends in contamination of both classic and emerging PTSs over the recent decadal period. Out of 26 target regions in Korea, five hotspots (Sihwa, Masan, Ulsan, Taean, and Gwangyang) of concern could be identified. Four of those regions have been designated as Specially-Managed Sea Area under the implementation of Total Pollution Load Management System in Korea, except for Taean coast (oil spill site). Meantime, we could identify three stepwise research phases based on a bibliographic analysis; Phase 1 (1995–2008), Phase 2 (2009–2015), and Phase 3 (2016–2020). It is noteworthy that a technical evolution of the SQT assessment by the phase was featured. It was also evidenced that in-depth studies adopting multiple lines of evidence (LOEs) became prevailed upon approaching Phase 3. In a quantitative manner, the toxicity explanatory power of target PTSs increased by about 10% in Phase 3 compared to the earlier phases. The meta-analysis using ratio-to-mean value method applied for the data set having all three LOEs indicated general improvement of sediment qualities in the hotspots. However, their associations quite varied across regions and years, reflecting a dynamicity in oceanographic settings and/or heterogeneity in toxicological effect or benthic community response. At present, SQT assessment adopting the increased LOEs generally supports better assessment. In conclusion, we suggest that future SQT studies globally should reaffirm the utility of the “multiple LOEs approach”, focusing on the identification and management of causative toxicants that driving negative ecological impacts on marine ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

Using a systematic literature review, we aimed to map current geographical research hotspots and gaps around environmental and public health risks research of agriculture pesticides in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Studies were included that collected primary data on past and current-used agricultural pesticides and assessed their environmental occurrence, related knowledge, attitude and practice, human exposure, and environmental or public health risks between 2006 and 2021. We identified 391 articles covering 469 study sites in 37 countries in SSA. Five geographical research hotspots were identified: two in South Africa, two in East Africa, and one in West Africa. Despite its ban for agricultural use, organochlorine was the most studied pesticide group (60%; 86% of studies included DDT). Current-used pesticides in agriculture were studied in 54% of the study sites (including insecticides (92%), herbicides (44%), and fungicides (35%)). Environmental samples were collected in 67% of the studies (e.g., water, aquatic species, sediment, agricultural produce, and air). In 38% of the studies, human subjects were investigated. Only few studies had a longitudinal design or assessed pesticide’s environmental risks; human biomarkers; dose-response in human subjects, including children and women; and interventions to reduce pesticide exposure. We established a research database that can help stakeholders to address research gaps, foster research collaboration between environmental and health dimensions, and work towards sustainable and safe agriculture systems in SSA. © 2021 by the authors.

Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) process has become one of the most dominant discharge sources of dioxins. A comprehensive discussion about dioxin formation mechanisms was reviewed in this paper, and the mechanisms of high-temperature gas-phase reaction and “de novo” synthesis were systematically illustrated in the form of diagrams. What’s more, the effects of various influencing factors on the formation of PCDD/Fs were briefly analyzed in the form of a table. We believed that temperature, catalyst, chlorine source, carbon source, oxygen concentration and moisture were necessary factors for PCDD/Fs formation. Control technologies of dioxins in MSWI process were summarized subsequently from three stages: pre-combustion, in-combustion and post-combustion, and a device for synergistic removal of dioxins based on multi-field force coupling and technical routes for controlling dioxin emissions were proposed, so as to provide mechanisms and methods for effectively reducing the emission concentration of dioxins. An introduction was also conducted of dioxin control technologies in municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI-FA) in this paper, and their mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages and technical maturity were illustrated in the form of diagrams, which can provide theory and reference for in-depth research of follow-up scholars and industrial application of dioxin control technologies. Finally, current research hotspots, challenges and future research directions were proposed. Implications: In this paper, the main research contents and achievements are as follows: With the emphasis placed on the formation mechanism of dioxins and effects of various influencing factors on the formation of PCDD/Fs. The control technology of dioxins in MSWI process is summarized subsequently from three stages: pre-combustion, in-combustion and post-combustion.A device for synergistic removal of dioxins based on multi-field force coupling and technical routes for controlling dioxin emissions are proposed.A systematic review is conducted of the research progress on control technologies of dioxins in MSWI fly ash in the most recent years.The mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages and technical maturity of PCDD/Fs degradation technologies in MSWI fly ash are illustrated in the form of diagrams.Current research hotspots, challenges and future research directions are proposed. © 2022 Air & Waste Management Association.},

	abstract = {Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are highly toxic and persistent organic pollutions that can accumulate in the environment. In this study, an aromatic ring cleavage module, a salicylic acid synthesis module, and a catechol metabolism module were respectively constructed in three Escherichia coli BL21 strains. Subsequently, the engineered strains were cocultured as an artificial consortium for the biodegradation of phenanthrene, a typical PHA. Single factor experiments and response surface methodology were used to identify the optimal degradation conditions, including an inoculation interval of 6 h, inoculation ratio of 1:1:1, and IPTG concentration of 2 mM. Under these conditions, the 7-day degradation ratio of 100 mg/L phenanthrene reached 72.67%. Moreover, the engineered Escherichia coli BL21 strains showed good phenanthrene degradation ability at substrate concentrations 10 mg/L up to 500 mg/L. Enzyme activity assays combined with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry measurements confirmed that the three engineered strains behaved as a synergistic consortium in the phenanthrene degradation process. Based on the analysis of the key metabolites, the engineered bacteria were supplemented at 7-day intervals in batches so that each engineered strain maintained its optimal degradation ability. The 21-day degradation ratio finally reached 90.66%, which was much higher than what was observed with simultaneous inoculation. These findings suggest that the three engineered strains with separate modules constructed in this study offer an attractive solution for removing PAHs from the environment. © 2021 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Background: Endocrine-disrupting compounds (EDCs) are ubiquitous substances that are found in our everyday lives, including pesticides, plasticizers, pharmaceutical agents, personal care products, and also in food products and food packaging. Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Parkinson’s disease (PD) is the second most common neurodegenerative disorder with an unclear etiology and no disease-modifying treatment to date. PD is considered a multifactorial disease, since both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its pathogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms linking these two key disease modifiers remain obscure. In this context, epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene expression without affecting the DNA sequence through DNA methylation, histone post-transcriptional modifications, and non-coding RNAs may represent the key mediators of the genetic–environmental interactions underlying PD pathogenesis. Environmental exposures may cause chemical alterations in several cellular functions, including gene expression. Emerging evidence has highlighted that smoking, coffee consumption, pesticide exposure, and heavy metals (manganese, arsenic, lead, etc.) may potentially affect the risk of PD development at least partially via epigenetic modifications. Herein, we discuss recent accumulating pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the impact of lifestyle and environmental factors on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PD development, aiming to shed more light on the pathogenesis and stimulate future research. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Several studies have reported exposure of humans to various endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) worldwide. However, there is a lack of data regarding EDC exposures in humans living in Southeast Asian countries, such as the Philippines. Hence, this study measured levels of 41 EDCs in women residing in the Greater Manila Area, home to the second largest city in Southeast Asia. Urine samples from women with versus without breast cancer were analyzed for 11 phthalate metabolites, 8 environmental phenols, and 10 bisphenols, while serum samples were analyzed for 12 perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). Out of the four groups of EDCs analyzed, PFAS were significantly associated with breast cancer (adjusted OR = 13.63, 95% CI: 3.24–94.88 p-trend = 0.001 for PFDoA; adjusted OR = 9.26, 95% CI 2.54–45.10, p-trend = 0.002 for PFDA; and adjusted OR = 2.66, 95% CI: 0.95–7.66, p-trend = 0.004 for PFHxA). Long-chain PFAS levels were positively correlated with age and were significantly higher in women from Region IV-A, a heavily industrialized region, than from the National Capital Region. Overall, this study showed baseline information regarding the level of EDCs in Filipinas, providing a glimpse of EDC exposure in women living in a megalopolis city in Southeast Asia. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic imprints have become a fundamental part of most ecosystems. Our chemical footprint is often detected using targeted approaches, whereas xenobiotics are embedded within the large pool of dissolved metabolites, altered by biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Thus, it is necessary to simultaneously study anthropogenic signals entwined with the variety of organic signatures that exist in aquatic environments. However, methods for non-targeted analysis of natural metabolites are not always well suited for the analysis of pollutants. Here, we report the reassessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer-based Priority PolLutant (PPL) solid-phase extraction (PPL-SPE), which is typically used to extract marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) for biogeochemical studies, to analyze a set of xenobiotics commonly observed in coastal North Pacific seawater. After PPL extraction and analysis by nontargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), we successfully detected 23 out of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products, biocides, perfluorocarbons, and polymer additives in a complex marine DOM sample using positive and negative electrospray ionization. We tested two pH conditions to mimic typical marine DOM extraction studies and found mean recovery rates of xenobiotics were approximately 10% higher in seawater pH (pH ~ 8) than in acidified samples (pH ~ 2) for both negative and positive modes, although overall, mean recovery rates were 10% lower in negative mode. Our results indicate that PPL-SPE in combination with non-targeted LC–MS/MS is capable of capturing the tested set of xenobiotics, thus allowing the repurposing of biogeochemical sampling strategies as well as existing DOM samples and MS data for the subsequent assessment of anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. © 2021 The Authors.

The PubMed search included keywords related to cognition and to pollution (in their titles) to identify studies on human participants published in English until 10 July 2020. The search yielded 84 relevant studies that described associations between exposure to air pollutants and an increased risk of lower cognitive function among children and adolescents, cognitive impairment and decline among adults, and dementia among older adults with supportive evidence of neuroimaging and inflammatory biomarkers. No study from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)was identified despite high levels of air pollutants and high rates of dementia. To conclude, air pollution may impair cognitive function across the life-course, but a paucity of studies from reLMICs is a major lacuna in research. © 2022 by the authors.

	abstract = {Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) is an environmental pollutant that accumulates in adipose tissue through the food chain. Hypercaloric, high-fat diet is considered to promote the accumulation of toxic lipophilic substances in tissues, whereas the loss of body fat through caloric restriction results in a recirculation of these substances. In rats, oral administration of DDE causes the onset of tissues damage; the concomitant intake of a high-fat diet ameliorates tissues status, probably because of the entrapment of the lipophilic substance in fat depots. Recent evidence demonstrates that DDE alters the expression of metallothioneins, proteins involved in cellular defense from oxidative stress, in a diet- and tissue-specific manner. This study is aimed to verify if 2 weeks of caloric restriction after the oral DDE treatment can modify metallothionein gene expression in tissues of high-fat fed rats. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrates that metallothionein gene expression after calorie restriction is tissue-specific and strongly influenced by both previous dietary conditions and DDE exposure. To avoid misleading conclusions on the interference of toxic xenobiotics on metallothionein gene expression is particularly important to consider the tissue, the cellular conditions, and the nutritional status of the animals, especially when the protein is used as an index of cells health. © 2022 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Since the onset of the pandemic, prescribing antimicrobials has become a common practice to treat patients infected with COVID-19. Areas covered: A systematic literature search was performed in the electronic databases MEDLINE, CINAHL, WHO COVID-19 database, including EMBASE, Scopus, WHO-COVID, LILACS, and Google Scholar to identify original articles published up to 31 July 2021. A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence or proportion of antimicrobial consumption among COVID-19 patients. Expert opinion: We identified 43 original articles, 33 studies from high-income countries, six from upper-middle-income countries, and four from lower-middle-income countries. Most of the studies presented data from hospital or secondary health-care settings (n = 34). Included studies measured antimicrobial consumption as Daily Defined Doses (DDD) or day of therapy (DOT) or percentage. A total of 19 studies measured antimicrobial consumption as DDDs or DOT. Meta-analysis revealed an overall high antimicrobial consumption of 68% (95% CI: 60% to 75%). The subgroup analysis found a lower consumption in high-income countries (58%, 95% CI: 48% to 67%), compared with lower and middle-income countries (89%, 95% CI: 82% to 94%). High antimicrobial consumption found in COVID-19 patients demands implementation of appropriate antimicrobial stewardship interventions. © 2021 The Author(s).

	abstract = {Per- and polyfluorinated substances (PFAS), ubiquitously present in the environment and biota, are transferred to the fetus via the placenta. PFAS can be distinguished, among other things, by their different carbon chain lengths and functional groups. The aim of this study was to provide comprehensive evidence on PFAS transfer rates across the human placental barrier by means of a meta-analysis based upon a systematic review. The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta. More data on effects of less well studied PFAS in pregnant women and neonates are needed to assess the potential risk for fetal exposure. © 2021 The Author(s).

This review critically examines heavy metal and organic pollutants' role in wood treatment sites and their etiological consequences. These pollutants are not only recalcitrant but also tenacious to degradation under ordinary conditions. Although some heavy metals are essential to human health, they are toxic at elevated concentrations. Heavy metals feature carcinogenic properties and cause serious health risks to live systems and the environment because of their bio-accumulative, non-degenerative, and refractory characteristics. On the other hand, organic pollutants are readily introduced into the ecosystem from irresponsible use of detergents, volatile organic compounds, paints, pesticides, and wood preservatives. During the wood treatment process, various chemicals are used to enhance durability. Nevertheless, the use of wood preservatives such as chromated copper arsenate (CCA) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) potentially induces pollutants considered detrimental to human health and the ecological environment. Remediation of wood treatment sites using phytomanagement strategies and nanotechnologies has been presented in this review. Therefore, some challenges and recommendations for further research and applications are herein presented. © 2022, Sami Publishing Company. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Endosulfan is a broadly applied cyclodiene insecticide which has been in use across 80 countries since last 5 decades. Owing to its recalcitrant nature, endosulfan residues have been reported from air, water and soil causing toxicity to various non-target organisms. Microbial decontamination of endosulfan has been reported previously by several authors. In the current study, we have evaluated the pathways of endosulfan degradation and its hazardous impact on other living beings including insects, humans, plants, aquatic life and environment by in-silico methods. For establishment of the endosulfan metabolism in different ecosystems, cell designer was employed. The established model was thereafter assessed and simulated to understand the biochemical and physiological metabolism of the endosulfan in various systems of the network. Topological investigation analysis of the endosulfan metabolism validated the presence of 207 nodes and 274 edges in the network. We have concluded that biomagnification of the endosulfan generally occurs in the various elements of the ecosystem. Dynamics study of endosulfan degrading enzymes suggested the important role of monooxygenase I, II and hydrolase in endosulfan bioremediation. Endosulfan shows toxicity in human beings, fishes and plants, however it is biodegraded by the microbes. To date, there are no reports of in- silico analysis of bioremediation of endosulfan and its hazardous effects on the environment. Thus, this report can be important in terms of modelling and simulation of biodegradation network of endosulfan and similar compounds and their impact on several other systems.

	abstract = {One of the deadliest types of human cancer is Pancreatic Cancer (PanCa), owing to its late stage at presentation and pervasive therapeutic resistance. In the USA, by 2020, PanCa is expected to be the second deadliest carcinogenesis. However, this cancer is usually asymptomatic in nature. Chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, and some infectious diseases are important risk factors. Besides these, acquired risk habits, such as smoking and high alcohol intake increase the chance of developing PanCa. Current meta-analysis suggests that the risk of PanCa may be increased by occupational exposures to chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr). In the digestive system, oxidative stress is known to initiate cancer response. Mitochondrial respiration is one of the key generation machinery, and other environmental and occupational exposures/chemical reagents that induce damage to the DNA, proteins, lipids, and produce many toxic and high mutagenic metabolites that could result in tumor behavior, changing it into a malignant phenotype, and finally in cancer cell transformation. Numerous toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic chemical substances along with stable and unstable free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), in the particulate and gas phase of tobacco smoke have the potential of biological oxidation. Several research documentations suggest that carcinogenic compounds in cigarette smoke stimulate cellular proliferation and progression of PanCa by inducing inflammation and fibrosis which results in genetic factors leading to the inhibition of cell death. It has been hypothesized that exposure to one of the occupational risk factors, Cd, a ubiquitous metal, is one of the potential cause of PanCa due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties. Evidence of involvement of Cd in PanCa development has been recently mentioned in our observational studies, meta-analyses, and experimental animal and in vitro studies. Gathering all these previous data, it is clear that oxidative stress-related responses are affected during Cd stress, but the apparent discrepancies observed in between the different research findings point towards the necessity to increase our knowledge on the spatial and temporal ROS signature under Cd stress which is present in different kinds of occupational exposures. Our present effort is to summarize findings in a systematic approach, as to how environmental and occupational risk factors induce ROS generation in PanCa, in addition to its mechanism of action, signalling cascade in the prognosis of the disease. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.},

	abstract = {The microbial transformation potential of 6:2 chlorinated polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 Cl-PFESA) was explored in anaerobic microbial systems. Microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater sludge, an anaerobic digester, and anaerobic dechlorinating cultures enriched from aquifer materials reductively dechlorinated 6:2 Cl-PFESA to 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA), which was identified as the sole metabolite by non-target analysis. Rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was achieved by the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The microbial community of the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures was impacted by 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure. Organohalide-respiring bacteria originally present in the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures, including Geobacter, Dehalobacter, and Dehalococcoides, decreased in relative abundance over time. As the relative abundance of organohalide-respiring bacteria decreased, the rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA dechlorination decreased, suggesting that the most likely mechanism for reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was co-metabolism rather than organohalide respiration. Reductive defluorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was not observed. Furthermore, 6:2 H-PFESA exhibited 5.5 times lower sorption affinity to the suspended biosolids than 6:2 Cl-PFESA, with the prospect of increased mobility in the environment. These results show the susceptibility of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to microbially mediated reductive dechlorination and the likely persistence of the product, 6:2 H-PFESA, in anaerobic environments. © 2022 American Chemical Society},

	abstract = {Background Exposure to the toxic metal cadmium is widespread globally and especially prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Early life (from pregnancy through childhood) is a vulnerable window for exposure. Therefore, interventions in low and middle-income countries to prevent or reduce early life exposure to cadmium may be relevant for improving public health. Methods We systematically reviewed five databases (Scopus, Web of Science, Global Health Medicus, Greenfile, and PubMed). Synthesis without meta-analysis (narrative synthesis) was used for data analysis due to the wide heterogeneity of included studies. Study quality and risk of bias were assessed using modified GRADE criteria. Results 4098 articles were returned by the search and a total of 26 studies from 21 LMICs were included in this review, ranging from policies to clinical treatment, rehabilitation and clean-up methods for agricultural soil, interventions for nutrition and cooking, and anti-pollution strategies at the household level. The interventions targeted children, pregnant and postpartum women, and/or women of childbearing age. While several studies provided some evidence of effectiveness, none appeared to offer a realistic solution for cadmium pollution at scale. Agricultural and food preparation studies were relatively frequent, particularly related to rice. Studies on air filtration during pregnancy indicated some effectiveness in reducing indoor cadmium exposures. Conclusions Cadmium pollution is a persistent and widespread threat to children’s health with few identified solutions. Long-lasting damage to children’s health starting in the earliest years should motivate investment in higher-quality interventions, innovations, and further research. © 2022,Journal of Global Health.

	abstract = {Humans are exposed every day to assorted environmental pollutants namely, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB), organochlorine pesticides (OCP), brominated flame-retardants (BFR), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), synthetic musks, heavy metals (e.g. cadmium) and plastic additives (e.g. bisphenol A, BPA). Besides environmental persistence, biomagnification and bioaccumulative properties, these pollutants are classified as endocrine disruptors (EDs), metabolic disruptors, neurologic disruptors. These compounds affect the normal function of several mechanisms in the human body being linked to human health issues as cancer development (e.g. breast, uterine and endometrial), miscarriage, birth defects, premature delivery and infertility. In order to prevent future health issue of women and possible progeny, the assessment of EDs accumulated is essential, particularly in adipose tissue. These samples have been referred as the ideal matrix to establish over time accumulation and long-term exposure of persistent and non-persistent lipophilic EDs. However, the invasive sample collection procedure and methodology processing discourages the usage of this matrix for biomonitoring studies. In this review, a Web of Science search without any publishing year restriction on the analysis in adipose tissue of PCB, OCP, BPA, cadmium, BFR and synthetic musks was performed. A total of 313 studies were found, 158 were European studies from which the studies with data on women EDs accumulation were selected for detailed analysis (n = 90). The results were structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The present paper is an overview on the existent EDs analytical methods and levels accumulated in women adipose tissue, with the correspondent health implications across Europe. The limits of detection and quantification were compared and a discussion with results obtained about the presence of ED was performed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Reductive dechlorination is the most efficient way for depletion of chlorinated organic pollutants (COPs) in anaerobic environment, where the methanogenesis is usually mass-produced. Both processes are essentially microbial-mediated electron accepting processes and received much attention in last decades, due to their great importance for the remediation of environment polluted by COPs, and the effect of global warming as well as biogas property, respectively. In this study, these two reductive processes were comprehensively summarized based on 337 measurements out of 68 articles published from 1990 to 2019, with the special interest in digging their potential co-occurrence. A striking relevance between these two processes (p <.05) was shown in most cases, with the accelerated methanogenesis co-occurring with the accelerated reductive removal of COPs. The possible reason underpinning this finding was then extensively discussed. In all, by big data mining associated with discussion regarding the likely involved chemical-microbial mediate mechanisms, this study gives an update evidence showing the synergistic coupling of COP reductive removal and methanogenesis. This provides insights into a novel consideration for site dependent regulation of COP dissipation in conjunction with methanogenesis, either for efficient wastewater treatment with energy saving, or for side-effect overcoming bioremediation of polluted paddy soil. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.},

	abstract = {With the rapid industrialization and economic development, heavy metals are continuing to be introduced to soils and sediments through fertilization, irrigation, rivers, runoff, atmospheric deposition and point sources. Additionally, activities such as metal mining, refining, and refinishing by products also contribute to the introduction of heavy metals in the environment. All these activities decrease the capability of the environment to support life thus threatening people, animal and plant health. Health implications associated with heavy metal exposure include those that disturbs nervous, blood forming, cardiovascular, renal and reproductive systems. Furthermore, accumulation of heavy metals in soil diminish quality of soil, cause crop yield decrease and affect the quality of agricultural products. It is important to appraise the concentration of heavy metals in the environment as they are toxic, persistent and nondegradable. Pollution indices are effective in appraisal of soil pollution with heavy metals, monitoring quality of soil and ensuring future sustainability.

	abstract = {Patent foramen ovale (PFO) describes a valve in the interatrial septum that permits shunting of blood or thrombotic material between the atria. PFOs are present in approximately 25% of the healthy population and are not associated with any pathology in the vast majority of cases. However, comparisons between patients with stroke and healthy controls suggest that PFOs may be causative of stroke in certain patients whose stroke is otherwise cryptogenic. Options for the diagnosis of PFO include transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. PFOs associated with an interatrial septal aneurysm seem to be more strongly linked to risk of recurrent stroke. Therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of a PFO include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and percutaneous device closure. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest that percutaneous closure reduces the subsequent risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients, with a large relative benefit but small absolute benefit. Referral for percutaneous PFO closure should therefore be considered in certain patients after a multidisciplinary, patient centered discussion. Areas for future study include structural biomarkers to aid in determining the role of PFO closure in older people with possible PFO associated stroke, the role of direct oral anticoagulants, and very long term outcomes after device closure.  © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

The over growth rate of population, industrialization, rapid urbanization, improper sanitation and use of agrochemicals might be deteriorated the water quality of Bangladesh. This study conducted one of the most comprehensive literature analyses on the current status of water quality in Bangladesh with special emphasis on both conventional pollutants (heavy metal, pesticide, fecal pollution) and emerging contaminants. Concentration of heavy metals is higher in the water bodies close to the industrial zones. Prevalence of the fecal coliform has been found in the water samples taken from almost all of the studied areas. Different pesticides from organophosphate, carbamate and organochlorine groups are found in wetlands near the irrigated land of Bangladesh. Among different emerging contaminants, the presence of antibiotic residue, fluorescence whitening agent and microplastics are recently being identified in water bodies of Bangladesh. Health risk assessment of heavy metals and pesticides residues in water were evaluated using hazard quotient (HQ) and carcinogenic risk (ILCR). The results showed that the water quality of many parts of the country is already deteriorated and significant number of populations under a potential threat of water pollution. Hence, there is an urgent need of the existence and implementation of strict laws on water quality. © 2021 The Author(s)},

Compared with traditional methods in neuroimmunology, which study one pathway or gene at a time, emerging multiomics methodologies allow for holistic interrogation of multiple immune-signaling pathways to test hypotheses and the effects of therapeutics at a systems level. In this review, the authors summarize key concepts for gathering and analyzing multiomics data so that neurosurgeons can contribute to the emerging field of systems neuroimmunology. Additionally, they describe 3 use cases, based on original research published by their group and others, that utilize transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses to study immune-signaling pathways in DDD, aSAH, and GBM. Through these use cases, techniques for performing machine learning and network-based analyses to generate new clinical insights from multiomics data are shared. The authors hope that neurosurgeons might use this review as a summary of common tools and principles in systems immunology to better engage in creating the immunotherapies of tomorrow. © 2022 AANS.

	abstract = {Thyroid hormone homeostasis is essential for normal brain development in fetuses and infants. Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level.

	abstract = {Background: Paediatric flat feet are a common presentation in primary care; reported prevalence approximates 15%. A minority of flat feet can hurt and limit gait. There is no optimal strategy, nor consensus, for using foot orthoses (FOs) to treat paediatric flat feet. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 01 September 2021, and two clinical trials registers on 07 August 2020. Selection criteria: We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FOs as an intervention for paediatric flat feet. The outcomes included in this review were pain, function, quality of life, treatment success, and adverse events. Intended comparisons were: any FOs versus sham, any FOs versus shoes, customised FOs (CFOs) versus prefabricated FOs (PFOs). Data collection and analysis: We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane. Main results: We included 16 trials with 1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years, with flexible flat feet. Distinct flat foot presentations included asymptomatic, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), symptomatic and developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD). The trial interventions were FOs, footwear, foot and rehabilitative exercises, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Due to heterogeneity, we did not pool the data. Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic (children with JIA) flat feet. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Three comparisons were evaluated across trials: CFO versus shoes; PFO versus shoes; CFO versus PFO. Asymptomatic flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low-quality evidence showed that CFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point visual analogue scale (VAS)) at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07); absolute decrease (11.8%, 95% CI 4.7% fewer to 15.8% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19); absolute effect (3.4% more, 95% CI 4.1% fewer to 13.1% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low to very-low quality evidence showed that PFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point VAS) at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.16); absolute effect (4.7% fewer, 95% CI 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23). 3. CFOs versus PFOs (1 trial, 108 participants): low-quality evidence found no difference in the proportion without pain at one year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18); absolute effect (7.4% fewer, 95% CI 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more); or on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12). Function and quality of life (QoL) were not assessed. Symptomatic (JIA) flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 28 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) between groups (MD -1.5, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.22). Low-quality evidence showed improvements in function with CFOs (Foot Function Index - FFI disability, 0 to 100, 0 best function; MD -18.55, 95% CI -34.42 to -2.68), child-rated QoL (PedsQL, 0 to 100, 100 best quality; MD 12.1, 95% CI -1.6 to 25.8) and parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 9, 95% CI -4.1 to 22.1) and little or no difference between groups in treatment success (timed walking; MD -1.33 seconds, 95% CI -2.77 to 0.11), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.94); absolute difference (9.7% fewer, 20.5 % fewer to 44.8% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 25 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain between groups (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.94 to 1.98). Low-quality evidence showed no difference between groups in function (FFI-disability MD -4.17, 95% CI -24.4 to 16.06), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -3.84, 95% CI -19 to 11.33), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -0.64, 95% CI -13.22 to 11.94). 3. CFOs versus PFsO (2 trials, 87 participants): low-quality evidence showed little or no difference between groups in pain (0 to scale, 0 no pain) at 3 months (MD -1.48, 95% CI -3.23 to 0.26), function (FFI-disability MD -7.28, 95% CI -15.47 to 0.92), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 8.6, 95% CI -3.9 to 21.2), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 2.9, 95% CI -11 to 16.8). Authors' conclusions: Low to very low-certainty evidence shows that the effect of CFOs (high cost) or PFOs (low cost) versus shoes, and CFOs versus PFOs on pain, function and HRQoL is uncertain. This is pertinent for clinical practice, given the economic disparity between CFOs and PFOs. FOs may improve pain and function, versus shoes in children with JIA, with minimal delineation between costly CFOs and generic PFOs. This review updates that from 2010, confirming that in the absence of pain, the use of high-cost CFOs for healthy children with flexible flat feet has no supporting evidence, and draws very limited conclusions about FOs for treating paediatric flat feet. The availability of normative and prospective foot development data, dismisses most flat foot concerns, and negates continued attention to this topic. Attention should be re-directed to relevant paediatric foot conditions, which cause pain, limit function, or reduce quality of life. The agenda for researching asymptomatic flat feet in healthy children must be relegated to history, and replaced by a targeted research rationale, addressing children with indisputable foot pathology from discrete diagnoses, namely JIA, cerebral palsy, congenital talipes equino varus, trisomy 21 and Charcot Marie Tooth. Whether research resources should continue to be wasted on studying flat feet in healthy children that do not hurt, is questionable. Future updates of this review will address only relevant paediatric foot conditions. Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration. Published by John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

This study then reviews the impacts of irrigation water on vegetables in peri- and urban areas and the associated public health implications, and emerging contaminats in irrigation water in Ghana. Considering the quality of irrigation water, loads of enteric bacteria have been reported reaching 538 mpn/ml and 940 mpn/ml. Though total and fecal coliforms and E. coli have been detected in irrigable water in Ghana, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura were observed in vegetables. Lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, alpha-endosulfan, endrin, 1,1-dichloro-2, 2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p-DDE), and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) are the dominant pesticides detected in water used for irrigation. The presence of Cr, Cd, Co, Cu, Zn, Pb, Fe, Ni, and Mn have been reported in irrigatable water. Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) that require extensive research in irrigation water are antibiotics, viruses (norovirus and adenovirus), and estrogens. Since untreated wastewater is predominantly used for irrigation in some parts of Ghana, high levels of Hg and Cd have been detected. Findings from this review indicate that the safety of vegetables sold in Ghana are largely dependent on the quality of water used for irrigation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the associations between prenatal exposure to persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and childhood obesity. We focused on organochlorines (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [DDE], hexachlorobenzene [HCB], and polychlorinated biphenyls [PCBs]), perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) that are the POPs more widely studied in environmental birth cohorts so far. We search two databases (PubMed and Embase) through July/09/2021 and identified 33 studies reporting associations with prenatal organochlorine exposure, 21 studies reporting associations with prenatal PFAS, and five studies reporting associations with prenatal PBDEs. We conducted a qualitative review. Additionally, we performed random-effects meta-analyses of POP exposures, with data estimates from at least three prospective studies, and BMI-z. Prenatal DDE and HCB levels were associated with higher BMI z-score in childhood (beta: 0.12, 95% CI: 0.03, 0.21; I2: 28.1% per study-specific log increase of DDE and beta: 0.31, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.53; I2: 31.9% per study-specific log increase of HCB). No significant associations between PCB-153, PFOA, PFOS, or pentaPBDEs with childhood BMI were found in meta-analyses.

	abstract = {Introduction: Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) is a compound used as an industrial surfactant in chemical processes worldwide. Population and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated positive correlations between PFOA levels and human health problems. Objectives: Many studies have focused on the hepatotoxicity and liver problems caused by PFOA, with little attention to remediation of these problems. As an antioxidant, vitamin C is frequently utilized as a supplement for hepatic detoxification. Methods: In this study, we use a mouse model to study the possible role of vitamin C in reducing PFOA-induced liver damage. Based on comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of vitamin C. Results: Our results show that vitamin C supplementation reduces signs of PFOA-induced liver damage including total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase, liver damage markers aspartate, transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase elevation, and liver enlargement. Further, we show that the protective role of vitamin C is associated with signaling networks control, suppressing linoleic acid metabolism, reducing thiodiglycolic acid, and elevating glutathione in the liver. Conclusion: The findings in this study demonstrate, for the first time, the utility of vitamin C for preventing PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity. © 2021},

A literature search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus with 10-years temporal restriction and with search terms of (‘pesticides’) and (‘maternal’ or ‘pregnancy’ or ‘gestational’ or ‘perinatal’ or ‘children’ or ‘infants’ or ‘birth weight’ or ‘gestational age’ or ‘cancer’ or ‘tumor’ or ‘malignancy’ or ‘carcinoma’) and (‘meta-analysis’ or ‘systematic review’). Using relative risk estimates, e.g., odds ratio (OR), relative risk (RR), ß coefficients, and 95% confidence interval (CI) as a prerequisite for inclusion/exclusion criteria a total of 19 eligible meta-analyses were included. The results showed that maternal domestic/occupational pesticide exposure increases the risk for childhood leukaemia. The overall OR regarding the risk of pesticide exposure and leukaemia was 1.23 to 1.57 with heterogeneity I2 values that varied between 12.9% and 73%. Some studies found that exposure to dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (p,p´-DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB-153) pesticides appears to decrease infant birth weight to some extent [p,p´-DDE (ß = −0.007 to −0.008)] and [PCB-153 (ß = −0.15 to −0.17)]Needing more studies on this relationship, our study found that pesticide exposure is a risk factor for leukaemia in children. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.},

	abstract = {Sulfide-modified nanoscale zerovalent iron (S-nZVI) has aroused increasing interest due to its excellent ability towards environmental decontamination. Heterogeneous catalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-H) mediated by iron-based materials has been explored by previous researches. Yet, unknown role and degradation mechanism of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-H) through S-nZVI driven peroxymonosulfate (PMS) need to be further investigated. In current research, the impacts of S-nZVI dosage, PMS dosage, initial pH, anions and humic acids were independently explored during TC-H degradation process. S-nZVI exhibited the high efficiency for activating PMS. TC-H degradation followed a pseudo-first order kinetics reaction with kobs at 0.1403 min−1. HA, Cl−, HPO42−, NO3− exhibited varied reduction of the reaction rates on TC-H removal. Besides, SO4•− and •OH were dedicated to degrading TC-H, and SO4•− was proved to be predominant one. The alteration of sulfide species from XPS analysis played a pivotal role in raising the electron transfer rate to improve TC-H degradation. Ten intermediates products were determined through HRMS and primary transformation mechanism involved in N-demethylation reaction, demethylation reaction, elimination reaction and hydrogenation reaction were proposed. Based on metabolomics analysis, up-regulated expression of carbohydrate metabolism, citrate cycle, CoA biosynthesis, fatty acid degradation and amino acid synthesis in Escherichia coli were significantly induced by the further products, whereas glutathione metabolism was significantly down-regulated, endorsing that potential toxicity induced by intermediates were weakened. To sum up, S-nZVI/PMS as a promising nano-water environmental remediation method could be feasible for emerging environment organic pollutants control. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.},

	abstract = {Background: Per- and polyfluoroalkyl (PFAS) substances are a group of anthropogenic organic chemicals. PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the ‘grey literature’. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by full-text screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist. We will collect information on conflict-of-interest statements, funding sources and availability of raw data and analysis code. We will extract relevant data from full texts and bibliographic records, conduct bibliometric analyses, and display findings as tables, figures and a narrative synopsis. © 2021 The Authors},

	abstract = {Purpose: Accumulating research suggests that psychotherapy helps improve abstinence but the difference in the efficacy of multiple psychotherapies in alcohol use disorder (AUD) remains to be explored. Patients and Methods: A systematic search of databases (Pubmed, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and EBSCO) for studies (published from inception to April 10th.) of adults diagnosed with AUD accepting psychotherapies was conducted. Studies covering 9 countries and regions. The qualitative analysis pooled 2646 individuals from 34 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and the networks included 1928 participants (23 RCTs). The outcomes included percentage of days abstinent (PDA), change in drinks per drinking day (change in DDD), and change in craving compared among individuals accepting various psychotherapies. The protocol followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), and was registered on the International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (PROSPERO). Results: For the network of PDA, motivational enhancement treatment (MET) (35.44, 11.78 to 59.09, high-certainty) and couple therapy (CT) (28.89, 13.42 to 44.36, moderate-certainty) were significantly different from treatment as usual (TAU) with the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) mean rank 1.9 and 1.9 respectively. TAU+supportive psychotherapy (SP) was better than TAU for the change in DDD in the high-quality direct comparison. Conclusion: The motivational enhancement and the couple therapy show potential amelioration for alcohol abstinence. Additionally, the preferred interventions are different for improving PDA and change in DDD. The evidence network remains to be strengthened. © 2022 Zhang et al.},

	abstract = {The main factor restricting lead isotope analysis of metals from museum collections is the requirement for physical material. Hence, there are major incentives for developing minimally invasive methods for lead isotope analysis that are accurate and precise enough to reveal historical information about artefacts and their origin. Portable laser ablation (pLA), collecting microscopic samples on Teflon filters, has four key benefits. It produces no visual impact to the artefacts, does not require transport of artefacts to laboratory facilities, there are no artefact size restrictions, and samples are processed under clean laboratory conditions allowing Pb purification prior to measurement by solution MC-ICPMS. To validate the efficacy of the pLA technique on silver, nine matrixed-matched commercial, in-house and archaeological reference materials were sampled and analysed multiple times (9-10). The pLA mean analyses (±2SD) were all consistent with inter-laboratory bulk analyses. The digestion of sample filters produces precisions that are consistently more than five-times better than in situ nsLA-MC-ICPMS and are the same order of magnitude expected for bulk samples processed in different laboratories.

	abstract = {Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is one of the interventions to control the vectors of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Different insecticides are used in affected countries, also in the Regional Initiative for the Elimination of VL in South-East Asia. This systematic review assesses all available studies analysing the effectiveness of IRS on the key vectors of VL. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, with a broad search strategy, applied to seven key databases. Inclusion criteria were studies focusing on 1) Visceral leishmaniasis 2) Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) or synonyms, and 3) all primary research methods. 21 studies were included, five cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), one randomised controlled trial (RCT), 11 intervention studies, also included were three modelling studies and one survey. 19 out of 21 included studies were published between 2009 and 2020. 18 of the studies were conducted in the context of the Regional Initiative. Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, confirmed in terms of effectiveness and by the availability of studies. Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts, and/or Phlebotomus argentipes counts by up to 95% with an effect of a minimum of one month. Prolonged effects are not regularly seen. DDT has been used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over time. Two intervention studies, embedded in larger programmes in 2019 and 2020, replaced DDT with alpha-Cypermethrin throughout the study. Combinations of different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as key issues for programmes. No human transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS–although modelling studies confirm the effect of IRS on human transmission. Concluding, IRS continues to be an effective intervention for Phlebotomus argentipes control. Delivery requires constant monitoring and quality assurance. Further studies need to assess IRS in different geographical areas affected by VL and combinations of interventions. © 2022 Faber et al.},
