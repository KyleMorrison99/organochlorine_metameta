Endogenous and Exogenous Estrogens on Biochemical and Performance Indicators of Exercise Induced Muscle Damage in Users and Non-Users of Oral Contraceptives,"It has been proposed that endogenous estrogens may protect skeletal muscle integrity and promote the repair and recovery process after acute muscle damage. The purpose of this study was to examine both biochemical and performance indices of exercise-induced muscle damage (EiMD) across menstrual cycle phases and compare oral contraceptive pill users (OCP) and eumenorrheic non-users (EUC). A total of 12 women (5 EUC; 7 OCP) underwent a prolonged eccentric running EiMD protocol and were evaluated for biochemical markers of skeletal muscle damage including creatine kinase (CK), C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and myoglobin (MgB) as well as performance markers including strength, range of motion (ROM), soreness perception, and swelling during early follicular (EF), late follicular (LF), and luteal (LU) phases. Measurements were taken pre- and post-exercise and at 24, 48, and 72 h post exercise. No differences were observed in ROM, swelling, or pain perception in response to EiMD across menstrual cycle phases. The EUC and OCP groups showed similar increases in CK, MgB, and soreness perception in response to EiMD across menstrual cycle phases. Strength recovery differed across menstrual cycle phases and between the EUC and OCP groups (p=0.011), being optimal in phases with higher endogenous estrogen levels (LF and LU). We conclude that endogenous estrogens produced during the natural menstrual cycle may support improved strength recovery, despite immediate increases in muscle cell damage, regardless of oral contraceptive pill use.",2247262005,,Dissertations & Theses,"Flanagan, Emily White"," Clif Bar & Co , University of Miami", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,, Dissertation/Thesis, 2019, 978-1-392-23073-2,,, English, English,2019,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,,2019,,,https://login.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/endogenous-exogenous-estrogens-on-biochemical/docview/2247262005/se-2?accountid=12763,," 0409 Endocrinology , 0487 Biochemistry , 0575 Kinesiology , 0719 Physiology"," 0409 Endocrinology , 0487 Biochemistry , 0575 Kinesiology , 0719 Physiology"," Pure sciences , Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Estrogen , Exercise physiology , Oral contraceptives , Skeletal muscle , Sports medicine"," 0409 Endocrinology , 0487 Biochemistry , 0575 Kinesiology , 0719 Physiology"," 0409 Endocrinology , 0487 Biochemistry , 0575 Kinesiology , 0719 Physiology"," Endocrinology , Biochemistry , Kinesiology , Physiology , Meta-analysis , Muscles , Obligatory contour principle , Feedback , Research design , Questionnaires , Sports , Repair , Medicine , Disorders , Statistical analysis , Perceptions , Time , Drug effects , Women , Sex differences , Cities , Drugs , Florida , Taylor, Harvey , Netherlands , United States--US , New York , Kansas City Missouri , Germany"," Pure sciences , Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Estrogen , Exercise physiology , Oral contraceptives , Skeletal muscle , Sports medicine",https://libkey.io/libraries/757/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:Nursing+%26+Allied+Health+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Endogenous+and+Exogenous+Estrogens+on+Biochemical+and+Performance+Indicators+of+Exercise+Induced+Muscle+Damage+in+Users+and+Non-Users+of+Oral+Contraceptives&amp;issn=&amp;date=2019-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Flanagan%2C+Emily+White&amp;isbn=978-1-392-23073-2&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest Central
"Investigations on the State of Pops in Ghana, and Human Biomonitoring of Dioxin-like Polychlorinated Biphenyls (Dlpcbs), Polychlorinated, Polybrominated and Mixed Halogenated Dibenzo-p-Dioxins and Furans (PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs, and PXDD/Fs) in Vulnerable Ghanaian Populations","The protection of human health and the environment, from persistent organic pollutants (POPs) is the major objective of the Stockholm Convention. However, in developing countries such as Ghana- one of the top pesticide users and highest POP emitters in sub-saharan Africa. Although the focus has primarily been on determination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in environmental matrices, there is limited information on how POP concentrations have changed, post ratification of the Stockholm Convention. In addition, human exposure data, on dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs)- one of the toxic classes of POPs in Ghana are limited. The purposes of this research were to: 1) Identify considerations for future research prioritization based on knowledge gaps from previously completed studies by collating available data that reported on POPs in Ghana. 2) Identify spatial and temporal POP trends in Ghana, and establish potential health risks 3) Quantify background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in sera of primiparous Ghanaians, and in breastmilk of Ghanaian lactating mothers, in addition to infant dietary exposure to dioxins and DLCs in breastmilk. The dissertation is divided into two main sections: The first part presents a comprehensive and systematic review on the Stockholm POPs previously studied in Ghana to date. The second part focuses on the use of modified analytical sample preparation methods and instrumentations to determine background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in Ghanaian human tissues, using gas chromatography with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-MS/MS) in Ghanaian human tissues. The first part of this work entails a systematic and comprehensive review of data on sample collection, preparation and analytical methods from previous studies undertaken on the Stockholm POPs in Ghana, since 2001. A review was conducted on POPs in different matrices: environmental and humans, a comparison of concentration against relevant health criteria, and a discussion on spatial and temporal trends. The purposes of this work were to determine whether POPs were increasing or decreasing in the Ghanaian environment, and to ascertain knowledge gaps in data, as the focus has heavily been on the environment, with limited/sporadic studies in humans. This review identified a need to assess exposures to toxic classes of POPs in vulnerable populations, including lactating mothers, pregnant women, and occupationally exposed workers. Results obtained from data analyses of previous studies showed concentrations in excess of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulatory standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in water, polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) in e-waste soils, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in aquatic organisms and dairy products. The published studies do not cover major regions nationwide. The inconsistency in methods and analytes measured, along with data scarcity in some regions, makes it challenging to identify temporal trends. However, decreasing concentrations of some legacy POPs in soil/sediment and aquatic organisms, with increasing concentrations of some POPs were reported in water, fish, fruits and vegetables. Studies that performed health risk assessments were limited although environmental and human data indicated elevated health risks to e-waste workers, some farmers and vulnerable sub-populations. This review identified potential human health risks from POPs in the Ghanaian environment and the need for more consistent and widespread monitoring program. Following recommendations from the first part of this research, the second part focuses on assessing Ghanaian human exposure to some of the toxic classes of POPs including dioxins and DLCs. An analytical sample separation method was developed that can be used for determination of low, background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in human serum and breastmilk. Previously established methods utilized multiple fractionation steps and clean-up procedures on expensive equipment, such as the Power-prep sample clean-up instrument. Thus, a manual sample extraction and clean-up method for analysis of low level DLCs in breastmilk and serum was developed for application in developing. The target analytes included detection of 17 congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), 12 congeners of 8 mono-ortho and 4 non-ortho coplanar or dioxin-like PCBs (dlPCBs), 7 congeners of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs), and 7 congeners of mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PXDD/Fs, where X=Br or Cl). Method validation was completed on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material 1958 (NIST 1958) serum samples. The analytical method provided for low limits of detection (LODs) in the femtogram levels (fg), with analytes recoveries ranging between 41.8-129.9 % for the classes of POPs studied (dlPCBs, PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs) in both serum and breastmilk samples.

"Heavy main-group metal coordination chemistry: A study of metal size, co-ligand, and secondary interactions","The first part of this work discusses a series of experiments involving trans-azobenzene, PhN=NPh, a redox active ligand, in conjunction with the alkaline earth metals calcium, strontium, barium and the rare earth metal europium. A series of complexes were prepared and characterized. The neutral co-ligands tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane are introduced as both solvents and Lewis basic donors. Ligand size effects are examined with the introduction of the bulkier azobenzene derivatives MesN=NPh and MesN=NMes (Mes = 2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 ). The fine structure details obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction allowed for the systematic study of primary ligand coordination modes, the quantity and mode of co-ligand coordination, and, finally, the nature and extent of secondary interactions, with respect to trends in metal size. We are able to closely examine the factors present that impart additional stabilization to these highly reactive species. In the latter part of this thesis, with a focus on MOCVD applications, the perfluoro-t-butoxide (PFTB) ligand is used to prepare a set of novel bismuth alkoxides. These complexes were compared to other bismuth alkoxides and early lanthanide alkoxides in both their structural and thermal properties. Using an adaptation of a previously published pathway, a number of novel bismuth compounds have been synthesized; this synthetic route has since been shown to be fruitful herein and results have been obtained with a related ligand system by a colleague. The pathway may prove a more general route to produce bismuth containing targets.",1873858629,,Dissertations & Theses,"Goos, Alan G.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,, Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 978-1-369-53112-1,,, English, English,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,,2016,,,https://login.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/heavy-main-group-metal-coordination-chemistry/docview/1873858629/se-2?accountid=12763,," 0485 Chemistry , 0486 Analytical chemistry , 0488 Inorganic chemistry"," 0485 Chemistry , 0486 Analytical chemistry , 0488 Inorganic chemistry"," Pure sciences , Alkaline earth , Bismuth , Coordination chemistry , Lanthanides , Main-group , Secondary interactions"," 0485 Chemistry , 0486 Analytical chemistry , 0488 Inorganic chemistry"," 0485 Chemistry , 0486 Analytical chemistry , 0488 Inorganic chemistry"," Chemistry , Analytical chemistry , Inorganic chemistry"," Pure sciences , Alkaline earth , Bismuth , Coordination chemistry , Lanthanides , Main-group , Secondary interactions",https://libkey.io/libraries/757/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Heavy+main-group+metal+coordination+chemistry%3A+A+study+of+metal+size%2C+co-ligand%2C+and+secondary+interactions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goos%2C+Alan+G.&amp;isbn=978-1-369-53112-1&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,SciTech Premium Collection
Psychological First Aid as a Public Health Disaster Response Preparedness Strategy for Responders in Critical Incidents and Disasters,"Disaster is exceptional in nature, unpredictable and has potential for mass destruction. It can greatly affect physical, psychological and social health of people. The lack of evidence-based psychosocial interventions and emergency preparedness contribute to the barriers of integrating psychological interventions into the routine disaster preparedness and relief protocols. Pre-deployment Psychological First Aid (PFA) is a model widely used and adopted as a community-based public health disaster response intervention. PFA training was evaluated in this thesis for its relevancy, impact, and feasibility of implementation with emergency responders. Four studies were conducted in this thesis to explore the applicability of PFA as a public health disaster response and preparedness strategy for responders in critical incidents. The first study, systematic reviews of the PFA application and training, provided emerging evidence of the impact of the field applications and trainings of PFA as an immediate post-disaster public mental health intervention. The second study was a randomized controlled trial of 802 community-based volunteer disaster responders to evaluate the effectiveness of PFA training in preparing responders with relevant skills to cope with and offer assistance in disaster settings. Results from 3-month and 6-month follow up analyses revealed that PFA training enhances responders’ self-efficacy to provide emotional comfort to survivors. However, no conclusive results on other mental health protective and promotion impacts on responders were observed in this study. On the other hand, in the third study, a post-deployment cross-sectional study in a field setting, conducted two months after a major maritime accident in Hong Kong showed more promising results. It investigated the effectiveness of pre-disaster training of PFA, in provision of emotional support to victims and first responders’ post-disaster mental health, among PFA-trained and non-trained responders. This was the first study to demonstrate the potential beneficial impact of PFA training to responders’ own mental health, including better coping, resilience, life satisfaction and perceived social support from friends. Trained PFA responders also showed better capacity to provide support in disasters, as shown by higher disaster mental health and PFA knowledge and self-efficacy in offering emotional support to survivors. Stakeholders’ interviews with representatives in disaster responding non-governmental organizations were conducted to examine the mental health needs of frontline workers, current agency psychosocial policies and barriers encountered, and relevancy of PFA and its training to frontline workers’ field experience. Results showed that most of the organizations with disasters responding mandates had inadequate measures to mitigate the adverse effects of critical incidents among the frontline workers. Nevertheless, all these stakeholders regarded PFA as a highly relevant and valuable measure to address the mental needs of the aid workers. Given the devastating impact of disasters, this study series provided the evidence that PFA is a relevant and feasible tool to equip first responders with skills that might be beneficial for promoting their mental health and self-care when engaging in disaster response work. Organization should consider adopting PFA as a pre-deployment training option into the current field deployment practices. Future research implications and implementation strategies in post-disaster mental health intervention and preparedness strategies were also discussed.",1691127433,,Dissertations & Theses,"Cheung, Yee Lai",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,, Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 978-1-321-82152-9,,, English, English,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,,2014,,,https://login.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/psychological-first-aid-as-public-health-disaster/docview/1691127433/se-2?accountid=12763,," 0347 Mental health , 0573 Public health"," 0347 Mental health , 0573 Public health"," Health and environmental sciences , Quantitative research , Surveys & questionnaires , Qualitative research , Self report , Regression analysis , Interviews , Cross-sectional study , Systematic review , Critical incidents , Disaster , Mental health , Psychological first aid , Psychosocial support , Responder , Response preparedness"," 0347 Mental health , 0573 Public health"," 0347 Mental health , 0573 Public health"," PSYCHOLOGY , Public health , HUMANRESOURCES , HUMANRESOURCES"," Health and environmental sciences , Quantitative research , Surveys & questionnaires , Qualitative research , Self report , Regression analysis , Interviews , Cross-sectional study , Systematic review , Critical incidents , Disaster , Mental health , Psychological first aid , Psychosocial support , Responder , Response preparedness",https://libkey.io/libraries/757/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:Psychology+Database&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Psychological+First+Aid+as+a+Public+Health+Disaster+Response+Preparedness+Strategy+for+Responders+in+Critical+Incidents+and+Disasters&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cheung%2C+Yee+Lai&amp;isbn=978-1-321-82152-9&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,ProQuest Central
Investigating the Relationship between Modifiable Environmental Risk Factors and Incidence of Colorectal Cancer: A Community Based Study,"Colorectal cancer is the third most diagnosed cancer and second leading cause of cancer related deaths in Canada. As Ontario has the largest population in Canada, it also has great disparities in colorectal cancer incidence. The region of Timiskaming has the highest incidence for colorectal cancer, while the region of Peel has the lowest incidence for colorectal cancer in Ontario. The purpose of this study is to identify the dominant non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors in the region of Timiskaming compared to the region of Peel that may be associated with diverging colorectal cancer incidence rates. The three objectives of the study included performing a systematic review on available published literature, creating an assessment questionnaire tool regarding environmental exposures, and utilizing the questionnaire assessment tool within a pilot study group while expanding it into the communities of interest. Findings indicate that there are dominant non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors in the regions of Timiskaming and Peel that may be associated with colorectal cancer. The dominant factors identified are tobacco/smoking, alcohol use, pesticides/organochlorines, and metal toxins. Following this study, it is imperative that recommendations are directed at a community level and relate to the assessment of potential non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors. Future research should accompany a larger sample size, multiple participant communities, and catering of the questionnaire tool towards the communities of interest.

Comprehensive development of high performance solid oxide fuel cells for intermediate and low temperature applications,"In order to develop high performance solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) operating at low to intermediate temperatures, the three main SOFC components—the anode, electrolyte, and cathode—were comprehensively studied. In order to lower anodic polarization losses in anode-supported SOFCs, a novel composite anode functional layer (AFL) having bimodal (nano/micro) structure was developed. Application of this AFL involved a simple process where a precursor solution was coated onto a conventional submicron sized colloidally-deposited Ni-GDC AFL. Cells prepared in this manner yielded maximum power densities (MPD) of 1.29, 1.16, 0.7 and 0.38 W/cm 2 at 650, 600, 550 and 500°C, respectively. Electrochemical impedance results showed a striking decrease in both ohmic and non-ohmic area specific resistances (ASRs) for these cells compared to those with either no AFL, or a conventional AFL. In addition, the effect composition of the conventional submironsized AFL on performance was examined. The highest MPD (1.15 W/cm 2 at 650°C) was achieved at a composition of 60wt% NiO. This composition had the best performance over the intermediate temperature range (450 to 650°C). For the potentio-static test, the cell exhibited stable performance over 200 hrs of operation at 1.1 W/cm 2 . It was also revealed that electrode ASR has an inverse linear relationship with maximum power density at 650°C. To better understand the effect of AFL composition, microstructural features of AFLs having various Ni-GDC compositions were quantified by a 3 dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique using a FIB/SEM dual beam system. Of the compositions tested, the highest triple phase boundary (TPB) density was achieved at 60wt% NiO, which corresponds to a 1:1 volume ratio of Ni to GDC phase. The quantified TPB density showed an inverse proportionality to electrode ASR. Using a wet chemical co-precipitation method, nano-sized ESB particles were successfully synthesized at temperatures as low as ? 500°C. Due to the high sinterability of this powder, a dense erbia stabilized bismuth oxide (ESB) layer was successfully formed on a gadolinia doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte by a simple colloidal coating method. A systematic study on the sintering behavior of ESB was conducted to determine the optimum sintering conditions for these materials. I-V measurement a cell using this bilayered electrolyte sytem showed a high power density (? 1.5 W/cm 2 ) at 650°C due to an enhancement in OCP and a significant reduction in ASR when compared to a GDC single cell. The performance of conventional (La 0.80 Sr 0.20 )MnO 3-? (LSM) cathodes were dramatically improved at the IT range by combining it with a highly conductive ESB phase. The electrode ASR measured from a symmetric cell consisting of LSM-ESB electrodes on an ESB electrolyte was only 0.08 ?-cm 2 at 700°C which is ?60% lower than that of LSM-ESB on GDC electrolytes (0.19 ?-cm 2 ). This exemplifies the synergetic effect the ESB phase has both in the cathode bulk and at the electrolyte/electrode interface. The MPDs of the anode-supported SOFCs with LSM-ESB cathodes on ESB/GDC bilayered electrolytes were ?836 mW/cm 2 at 650°C, which is the highest value reported for SOFCs using LSM-bismuth oxide composite cathodes.",858042645,,Dissertations & Theses,"Lee, Kang Taek",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,, Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 978-1-124-52319-4,,, English, English,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,,2010,,,https://login.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/comprehensive-development-high-performance-solid/docview/858042645/se-2?accountid=12763,," 0537 Engineering , 0794 Materials science"," 0537 Engineering , 0794 Materials science"," Applied sciences , Anode functional layer , Cathodes , Fuel cells , LSM-bismuth oxide , Low temperature , Solid oxide"," 0537 Engineering , 0794 Materials science"," 0537 Engineering , 0794 Materials science"," Engineering , Materials science"," Applied sciences , Anode functional layer , Cathodes , Fuel cells , LSM-bismuth oxide , Low temperature , Solid oxide",https://libkey.io/libraries/757/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Comprehensive+development+of+high+performance+solid+oxide+fuel+cells+for+intermediate+and+low+temperature+applications&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Kang+Taek&amp;isbn=978-1-124-52319-4&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,SciTech Premium Collection
Understanding the interplay between water chemistry and electrochemical properties of copper,"The pitting behavior of UNS C11000 copper was investigated in a synthetic potable water found to cause pitting using both driven electrochemical methods and under natural conditions at OCP. The latter was monitored with coupled multi-electrode arrays (CMEA). Tests were also conducted in several HCO 3 - , SO 4 2- and Cl - containing-waters with systematic variations in the concentrations of these species. Empirical equations that forecast pitting (E Pit ) and repassivation (E Rp ) potential as a function of selected water chemistry variables were developed. OCP was a strong function of water chemistry, pH and time. Maximum OCPs were found to increase with both pH and Cl 2 . Empirical equations that forecast the OCP as a function of pH and Cl 2 were also developed. Natural pitting was tested in different pH synthetic waters (6-10) at various Cl 2 levels (0-5 ppm). The CMEA method successfully detected the formation of persistent anodes (pitting sites) in pH ?7 synthetic waters compared to formation of switchable anodes at pH 6. A pitting factor was determined as a function of water chemistry. Pit events were statistically analyzed and potential excursions were compared to E Pit and E Rp . Natural pitting events occurred on a percentage of electrodes once the OCP rose above E Rp and this could be rationalized based on the statistical spread in E Pit . Pits stopped growing once the OCP dropped below E Rp Pitting severity increased with Cl 2 level and pH. The cathodic capacity of adjacent cathodic sites as a function of water chemistry and the nature of the cathodic sites was also factored into this analysis. Lastly, the possible roles of deposited aluminum solids in pit initiation were also examined using several diagnostic methods.",305012094,,Dissertations & Theses,"Cong, Hongbo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.,, Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 978-1-109-10505-6,,, English, English,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,,2009,,,https://login.wwwproxy1.library.unsw.edu.au/login?url=https://www.proquest.com/dissertations-theses/understanding-interplay-between-water-chemistry/docview/305012094/se-2?accountid=12763,, 0794 Materials science, 0794 Materials science," Applied sciences , Aluminum solids , Copper , Coupled multielectrode arrays , Drinking water , Free residual chlorine , Pitting corrosion", 0794 Materials science, 0794 Materials science, Materials science," Applied sciences , Aluminum solids , Copper , Coupled multielectrode arrays , Drinking water , Free residual chlorine , Pitting corrosion",https://libkey.io/libraries/757/openurl?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations&amp;sid=ProQ:Matericals+Science+%26+Engineering+Dissertations&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Understanding+the+interplay+between+water+chemistry+and+electrochemical+properties+of+copper&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cong%2C+Hongbo&amp;isbn=978-1-109-10505-6&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,SciTech Premium Collection
"Comprehensive analysis, Henry's law constant determination, and photocatalytic degradation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and/or other persistent organic pollutants (POPs).","A method for the congener-specific analysis of multiple classes of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been developed. It consists of high-speed blending extraction, automated FMS cleanup/fractionation or GPC-Florisil cleanup, and final determination by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fifty-five 13 C(12)- or 2 H-labeled compounds were used as surrogates to evaluate the analytical efficiency. Proper polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) congeners were used as internal standards to monitor the GC performance. Potential GC-MS chromatographic interferences were studied. The method was demonstrated to be reproducible, effective, and reliable and was applied successfully to determine POP concentrations in northwestern Atlantic harbor seal (Phoca vitulina concolor) blubber samples. PCBs and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) account for more than 95% of the POP contamination, while non-ortho- and mono-ortho- substituted PCBs are the principal contributors to the total toxic equivalents (TEQs) in seal blubber. Four non-ortho- and eight mono-ortho-substituted PCBs are potent inducers of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH). Therefore, evaluation of their environmental behaviors in terms of their physicochemical characteristics, such as Henry's Law constant (HLC), is very important. A modified gas purging technique was used to determine HLCs for these 12 PCBs. Measured HLCs range from 5.6 to 21.8 Pa*m 3 /mol and they are comparable with literature values. Meta-analysis technique and principal component regression (PCR) was applied to model the relationship between experimentally-determined HLCs for 97 PCBs and the congeners'structures. Results suggest that HLCs for PCB are primarily affected by meta-chlorine substitution and chlorine substitution on the biphenyl ring generally leads to smaller HLCs. The PCR-predicted HLCs are in good agreement with the experimental values and the predicted HLCs by a complicated partial least-square regression (PLSR) model using the molecular connectivity index as predictor. Finally, photocatalytic degradation of 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl was conducted in the TiO(2) aqueous suspensions. 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl degradation follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. Three hydroxylated byproducts, 4,4'-dichloro-2-biphenyl-ol, 4-chloro-4'-bipenyl-ol, and 4,4'-dichloro-3-biphenyl-ol were identified and they underwent further photocatalytic decomposition. Kinetic modeling indicates that hydroxylation is the major pathway for PCB decomposition by UV/TiO(2). A sketch of the reaction pathways for 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl based on the byproducts formed has been proposed.",35298940, 200902-16-0016424 (SO),Dissertations & Theses,"Lee, Furrina Fang",,," Lee, Furrina Fang", Dissertation,,,0419-4217,1, English, English,2007,Dissertation Abstracts International, CSAPTdissertations,2007," University Microfilms International, P.O.

Robust design of high gain amplifiers using dynamical systems and bifurcation theory.,"High gain operational amplifiers are by far the most fundamental building block in analog and mixed-signal design. In the first few chapters, design of high gain CMOS positive feedback amplifiers (PFAs) is studied. A low-voltage positive feedback amplifier in standard digital CMOS with 70dB DC gain over a 2Vpp output swing range. Test results of fabricated chips confirmed better than 90dB operating-point DC gain, > =60dB DC gain over 2Vpp. It has nearly 90 degrees of phase margin and 140MHz gain-bandwidth product when driving 1pF capacitive load with 1mA from 3.5V single supply. Both linear and nonlinear behaviors of the PFA are carefully studied in order to enhance and maintain high gain automatically. Inherent nonlinearity in its DC transfer curve is discovered and analyzed. Based on nonlinear dynamic systems and bifurcation theory, we predict bifurcation and hysteresis phenomena in the PFA. An algorithm, which can be implemented using simple digital logic, is developed to measure the PFA's open-loop stability as the bifurcation parameter changes. Parameter-tuning algorithms are constructed that systematically move the amplifier's operational point towards the bifurcation point, at which infinite DC gain happens. In order to compensate for the PFA's high sensitivity to process and temperature variations, flexible analog design integrating digital programmability and inexpensive and adaptive digital post-processing techniques are developed. This flexibility and post-processing capability could dramatically enhance the PFA's yield. Full corner simulation results over wide temperature range verify the bifurcation phenomena and the effectiveness of the control algorithms. It is shown that this amplifier can maintain high performance in the most advanced digital CMOS technology at very low voltage supplies. They also demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a robust PFA design with both high yield and high performance. Matching of critical components is the most fundamental property that is necessary in achieving high linearity performance of analog mixed-signal circuits. Although matching qualities in future advanced digital CMOS technology are forecast to deteriorate as feature sizes continue to shrink, there has not been significant progress in developing advanced matching layout strategies. Chapter 4 is devoted to addressing this issue. In this chapter, systematic mismatch error in integrated circuits due to gradient effects is modeled and analyzed. Three layout strategies with improved matching performance are proposed and summarized. The hexagonal tessellation pattern can cancel quadratic gradient errors with only 3 units for each device and has high area-efficiency when extended. Both the N th -order circular symmetry patterns and N th -order central symmetry patterns can cancel up to N th order gradient effects between two devices using 2 N unit cells for each one. Among these three techniques, the central symmetry patterns have the best-reported matching performance for Manhattan structures; the circular-symmetry patterns have the best theoretical matching performance; and the hexagonal tessellation pattern has high density and high structural stability. The N th -order central symmetry technique is compatible to all IC fabrication processes requiring no special design rules. Simulation results of these proposed techniques show better matching characteristics than other existing layout techniques under nonlinear gradient effects. Specifically, two pairs of P-poly resistors using 2 nd and 3 rd -order central symmetry patterns were fabricated and tested. Less than 0.04% mismatch and less than 0.002% mismatch were achieved for the 2 nd and the 3 rd -order structures, respectively. Our proposed new layout strategies improved matching performance significantly.",33449356," 200904-10-0030077 (CI) , 200904-20-0021427 (EA)",Dissertations & Theses,"He, Chengming",,," He, Chengming", Dissertation,,,0419-4217,4, English, English,2007,Dissertation Abstracts International, CSAPTdissertations,2007," University Microfilms International, P.O.
