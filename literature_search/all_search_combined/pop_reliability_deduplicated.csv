rayyan-1259294646,Endogenous and Exogenous Estrogens on Biochemical and Performance Indicators of Exercise Induced Muscle Damage in Users and Non-Users of Oral Contraceptives,2019,1,1,,,NA,NA,,"Flanagan, Emily White",, English,,,"It has been proposed that endogenous estrogens may protect skeletal muscle integrity and promote the repair and recovery process after acute muscle damage. The purpose of this study was to examine both biochemical and performance indices of exercise-induced muscle damage (EiMD) across menstrual cycle phases and compare oral contraceptive pill users (OCP) and eumenorrheic non-users (EUC). A total of 12 women (5 EUC; 7 OCP) underwent a prolonged eccentric running EiMD protocol and were evaluated for biochemical markers of skeletal muscle damage including creatine kinase (CK), C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and myoglobin (MgB) as well as performance markers including strength, range of motion (ROM), soreness perception, and swelling during early follicular (EF), late follicular (LF), and luteal (LU) phases. Measurements were taken pre- and post-exercise and at 24, 48, and 72 h post exercise. No differences were observed in ROM, swelling, or pain perception in response to EiMD across menstrual cycle phases. The EUC and OCP groups showed similar increases in CK, MgB, and soreness perception in response to EiMD across menstrual cycle phases. Strength recovery differed across menstrual cycle phases and between the EUC and OCP groups (p=0.011), being optimal in phases with higher endogenous estrogen levels (LF and LU). We conclude that endogenous estrogens produced during the natural menstrual cycle may support improved strength recovery, despite immediate increases in muscle cell damage, regardless of oral contraceptive pill use.",,,Estrogens,NA,,endogenous and exogenous estrogens on biochemical and performance indicators of exercise induced muscle damage in users and nonusers of oral contraceptives

However, in developing countries such as Ghana- one of the top pesticide users and highest POP emitters in sub-saharan Africa. Although the focus has primarily been on determination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in environmental matrices, there is limited information on how POP concentrations have changed, post ratification of the Stockholm Convention. In addition, human exposure data, on dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs)- one of the toxic classes of POPs in Ghana are limited. The purposes of this research were to: 1) Identify considerations for future research prioritization based on knowledge gaps from previously completed studies by collating available data that reported on POPs in Ghana. 2) Identify spatial and temporal POP trends in Ghana, and establish potential health risks 3) Quantify background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in sera of primiparous Ghanaians, and in breastmilk of Ghanaian lactating mothers, in addition to infant dietary exposure to dioxins and DLCs in breastmilk. The dissertation is divided into two main sections: The first part presents a comprehensive and systematic review on the Stockholm POPs previously studied in Ghana to date. The second part focuses on the use of modified analytical sample preparation methods and instrumentations to determine background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in Ghanaian human tissues, using gas chromatography with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-MS/MS) in Ghanaian human tissues. The first part of this work entails a systematic and comprehensive review of data on sample collection, preparation and analytical methods from previous studies undertaken on the Stockholm POPs in Ghana, since 2001. A review was conducted on POPs in different matrices: environmental and humans, a comparison of concentration against relevant health criteria, and a discussion on spatial and temporal trends. The purposes of this work were to determine whether POPs were increasing or decreasing in the Ghanaian environment, and to ascertain knowledge gaps in data, as the focus has heavily been on the environment, with limited/sporadic studies in humans. This review identified a need to assess exposures to toxic classes of POPs in vulnerable populations, including lactating mothers, pregnant women, and occupationally exposed workers. Results obtained from data analyses of previous studies showed concentrations in excess of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulatory standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in water, polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) in e-waste soils, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in aquatic organisms and dairy products. The published studies do not cover major regions nationwide. The inconsistency in methods and analytes measured, along with data scarcity in some regions, makes it challenging to identify temporal trends. However, decreasing concentrations of some legacy POPs in soil/sediment and aquatic organisms, with increasing concentrations of some POPs were reported in water, fish, fruits and vegetables. Studies that performed health risk assessments were limited although environmental and human data indicated elevated health risks to e-waste workers, some farmers and vulnerable sub-populations. This review identified potential human health risks from POPs in the Ghanaian environment and the need for more consistent and widespread monitoring program. Following recommendations from the first part of this research, the second part focuses on assessing Ghanaian human exposure to some of the toxic classes of POPs including dioxins and DLCs. An analytical sample separation method was developed that can be used for determination of low, background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in human serum and breastmilk. Previously established methods utilized multiple fractionation steps and clean-up procedures on expensive equipment, such as the Power-prep sample clean-up instrument. Thus, a manual sample extraction and clean-up method for analysis of low level DLCs in breastmilk and serum was developed for application in developing. The target analytes included detection of 17 congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), 12 congeners of 8 mono-ortho and 4 non-ortho coplanar or dioxin-like PCBs (dlPCBs), 7 congeners of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs), and 7 congeners of mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PXDD/Fs, where X=Br or Cl). Method validation was completed on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material 1958 (NIST 1958) serum samples. The analytical method provided for low limits of detection (LODs) in the femtogram levels (fg), with analytes recoveries ranging between 41.8-129.9 % for the classes of POPs studied (dlPCBs, PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs) in both serum and breastmilk samples.

A series of complexes were prepared and characterized. The neutral co-ligands tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane are introduced as both solvents and Lewis basic donors. Ligand size effects are examined with the introduction of the bulkier azobenzene derivatives MesN=NPh and MesN=NMes (Mes = 2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 ). The fine structure details obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction allowed for the systematic study of primary ligand coordination modes, the quantity and mode of co-ligand coordination, and, finally, the nature and extent of secondary interactions, with respect to trends in metal size. We are able to closely examine the factors present that impart additional stabilization to these highly reactive species. In the latter part of this thesis, with a focus on MOCVD applications, the perfluoro-t-butoxide (PFTB) ligand is used to prepare a set of novel bismuth alkoxides. These complexes were compared to other bismuth alkoxides and early lanthanide alkoxides in both their structural and thermal properties. Using an adaptation of a previously published pathway, a number of novel bismuth compounds have been synthesized; this synthetic route has since been shown to be fruitful herein and results have been obtained with a related ligand system by a colleague.

It can greatly affect physical, psychological and social health of people. The lack of evidence-based psychosocial interventions and emergency preparedness contribute to the barriers of integrating psychological interventions into the routine disaster preparedness and relief protocols. Pre-deployment Psychological First Aid (PFA) is a model widely used and adopted as a community-based public health disaster response intervention. PFA training was evaluated in this thesis for its relevancy, impact, and feasibility of implementation with emergency responders. Four studies were conducted in this thesis to explore the applicability of PFA as a public health disaster response and preparedness strategy for responders in critical incidents. The first study, systematic reviews of the PFA application and training, provided emerging evidence of the impact of the field applications and trainings of PFA as an immediate post-disaster public mental health intervention. The second study was a randomized controlled trial of 802 community-based volunteer disaster responders to evaluate the effectiveness of PFA training in preparing responders with relevant skills to cope with and offer assistance in disaster settings. Results from 3-month and 6-month follow up analyses revealed that PFA training enhances responders self-efficacy to provide emotional comfort to survivors. However, no conclusive results on other mental health protective and promotion impacts on responders were observed in this study. On the other hand, in the third study, a post-deployment cross-sectional study in a field setting, conducted two months after a major maritime accident in Hong Kong showed more promising results. It investigated the effectiveness of pre-disaster training of PFA, in provision of emotional support to victims and first responders post-disaster mental health, among PFA-trained and non-trained responders. This was the first study to demonstrate the potential beneficial impact of PFA training to responders own mental health, including better coping, resilience, life satisfaction and perceived social support from friends. Trained PFA responders also showed better capacity to provide support in disasters, as shown by higher disaster mental health and PFA knowledge and self-efficacy in offering emotional support to survivors. Stakeholders interviews with representatives in disaster responding non-governmental organizations were conducted to examine the mental health needs of frontline workers, current agency psychosocial policies and barriers encountered, and relevancy of PFA and its training to frontline workers field experience. Results showed that most of the organizations with disasters responding mandates had inadequate measures to mitigate the adverse effects of critical incidents among the frontline workers. Nevertheless, all these stakeholders regarded PFA as a highly relevant and valuable measure to address the mental needs of the aid workers. Given the devastating impact of disasters, this study series provided the evidence that PFA is a relevant and feasible tool to equip first responders with skills that might be beneficial for promoting their mental health and self-care when engaging in disaster response work. Organization should consider adopting PFA as a pre-deployment training option into the current field deployment practices. Future research implications and implementation strategies in post-disaster mental health intervention and preparedness strategies were also discussed.",,,Disasters,NA,,psychological first aid as a public health disaster response preparedness strategy for responders in critical incidents and disasters

As Ontario has the largest population in Canada, it also has great disparities in colorectal cancer incidence. The region of Timiskaming has the highest incidence for colorectal cancer, while the region of Peel has the lowest incidence for colorectal cancer in Ontario. The purpose of this study is to identify the dominant non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors in the region of Timiskaming compared to the region of Peel that may be associated with diverging colorectal cancer incidence rates. The three objectives of the study included performing a systematic review on available published literature, creating an assessment questionnaire tool regarding environmental exposures, and utilizing the questionnaire assessment tool within a pilot study group while expanding it into the communities of interest. Findings indicate that there are dominant non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors in the regions of Timiskaming and Peel that may be associated with colorectal cancer. The dominant factors identified are tobacco/smoking, alcohol use, pesticides/organochlorines, and metal toxins. Following this study, it is imperative that recommendations are directed at a community level and relate to the assessment of potential non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors. Future research should accompany a larger sample size, multiple participant communities, and catering of the questionnaire tool towards the communities of interest.

In order to lower anodic polarization losses in anode-supported SOFCs, a novel composite anode functional layer (AFL) having bimodal (nano/micro) structure was developed. Application of this AFL involved a simple process where a precursor solution was coated onto a conventional submicron sized colloidally-deposited Ni-GDC AFL. Cells prepared in this manner yielded maximum power densities (MPD) of 1.29, 1.16, 0.7 and 0.38 W/cm 2 at 650, 600, 550 and 500°C, respectively. Electrochemical impedance results showed a striking decrease in both ohmic and non-ohmic area specific resistances (ASRs) for these cells compared to those with either no AFL, or a conventional AFL. In addition, the effect composition of the conventional submironsized AFL on performance was examined. The highest MPD (1.15 W/cm 2 at 650°C) was achieved at a composition of 60wt% NiO. This composition had the best performance over the intermediate temperature range (450 to 650°C). For the potentio-static test, the cell exhibited stable performance over 200 hrs of operation at 1.1 W/cm 2 . It was also revealed that electrode ASR has an inverse linear relationship with maximum power density at 650°C. To better understand the effect of AFL composition, microstructural features of AFLs having various Ni-GDC compositions were quantified by a 3 dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique using a FIB/SEM dual beam system. Of the compositions tested, the highest triple phase boundary (TPB) density was achieved at 60wt% NiO, which corresponds to a 1:1 volume ratio of Ni to GDC phase. The quantified TPB density showed an inverse proportionality to electrode ASR. Using a wet chemical co-precipitation method, nano-sized ESB particles were successfully synthesized at temperatures as low as ? 500°C. Due to the high sinterability of this powder, a dense erbia stabilized bismuth oxide (ESB) layer was successfully formed on a gadolinia doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte by a simple colloidal coating method. A systematic study on the sintering behavior of ESB was conducted to determine the optimum sintering conditions for these materials. I-V measurement a cell using this bilayered electrolyte sytem showed a high power density (? 1.5 W/cm 2 ) at 650°C due to an enhancement in OCP and a significant reduction in ASR when compared to a GDC single cell. The performance of conventional (La 0.80 Sr 0.20 )MnO 3-? (LSM) cathodes were dramatically improved at the IT range by combining it with a highly conductive ESB phase. The electrode ASR measured from a symmetric cell consisting of LSM-ESB electrodes on an ESB electrolyte was only 0.08 ?-cm 2 at 700°C which is ?60% lower than that of LSM-ESB on GDC electrolytes (0.19 ?-cm 2 ). This exemplifies the synergetic effect the ESB phase has both in the cathode bulk and at the electrolyte/electrode interface. The MPDs of the anode-supported SOFCs with LSM-ESB cathodes on ESB/GDC bilayered electrolytes were ?836 mW/cm 2 at 650°C, which is the highest value reported for SOFCs using LSM-bismuth oxide composite cathodes.",,,,NA,,comprehensive development of high performance solid oxide fuel cells for intermediate and low temperature applications

The latter was monitored with coupled multi-electrode arrays (CMEA). Tests were also conducted in several HCO 3 - , SO 4 2- and Cl - containing-waters with systematic variations in the concentrations of these species. Empirical equations that forecast pitting (E Pit ) and repassivation (E Rp ) potential as a function of selected water chemistry variables were developed. OCP was a strong function of water chemistry, pH and time. Maximum OCPs were found to increase with both pH and Cl 2 . Empirical equations that forecast the OCP as a function of pH and Cl 2 were also developed. Natural pitting was tested in different pH synthetic waters (6-10) at various Cl 2 levels (0-5 ppm). The CMEA method successfully detected the formation of persistent anodes (pitting sites) in pH ?7 synthetic waters compared to formation of switchable anodes at pH 6. A pitting factor was determined as a function of water chemistry. Pit events were statistically analyzed and potential excursions were compared to E Pit and E Rp . Natural pitting events occurred on a percentage of electrodes once the OCP rose above E Rp and this could be rationalized based on the statistical spread in E Pit . Pits stopped growing once the OCP dropped below E Rp Pitting severity increased with Cl 2 level and pH. The cathodic capacity of adjacent cathodic sites as a function of water chemistry and the nature of the cathodic sites was also factored into this analysis. Lastly, the possible roles of deposited aluminum solids in pit initiation were also examined using several diagnostic methods.",,,Copper,NA,,understanding the interplay between water chemistry and electrochemical properties of copper

Box 1764, Ann Arbor, MI, 48106, USA",,"A method for the congener-specific analysis of multiple classes of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been developed. It consists of high-speed blending extraction, automated FMS cleanup/fractionation or GPC-Florisil cleanup, and final determination by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fifty-five 13 C(12)- or 2 H-labeled compounds were used as surrogates to evaluate the analytical efficiency. Proper polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) congeners were used as internal standards to monitor the GC performance. Potential GC-MS chromatographic interferences were studied. The method was demonstrated to be reproducible, effective, and reliable and was applied successfully to determine POP concentrations in northwestern Atlantic harbor seal (Phoca vitulina concolor) blubber samples. PCBs and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) account for more than 95% of the POP contamination, while non-ortho- and mono-ortho- substituted PCBs are the principal contributors to the total toxic equivalents (TEQs) in seal blubber. Four non-ortho- and eight mono-ortho-substituted PCBs are potent inducers of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH). Therefore, evaluation of their environmental behaviors in terms of their physicochemical characteristics, such as Henry's Law constant (HLC), is very important. A modified gas purging technique was used to determine HLCs for these 12 PCBs. Measured HLCs range from 5.6 to 21.8 Pa*m 3 /mol and they are comparable with literature values. Meta-analysis technique and principal component regression (PCR) was applied to model the relationship between experimentally-determined HLCs for 97 PCBs and the congeners'structures. Results suggest that HLCs for PCB are primarily affected by meta-chlorine substitution and chlorine substitution on the biphenyl ring generally leads to smaller HLCs. The PCR-predicted HLCs are in good agreement with the experimental values and the predicted HLCs by a complicated partial least-square regression (PLSR) model using the molecular connectivity index as predictor. Finally, photocatalytic degradation of 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl was conducted in the TiO(2) aqueous suspensions. 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl degradation follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. Three hydroxylated byproducts, 4,4'-dichloro-2-biphenyl-ol, 4-chloro-4'-bipenyl-ol, and 4,4'-dichloro-3-biphenyl-ol were identified and they underwent further photocatalytic decomposition. Kinetic modeling indicates that hydroxylation is the major pathway for PCB decomposition by UV/TiO(2).

Box 1764, Ann Arbor, MI, 48106, USA",,"High gain operational amplifiers are by far the most fundamental building block in analog and mixed-signal design. In the first few chapters, design of high gain CMOS positive feedback amplifiers (PFAs) is studied. A low-voltage positive feedback amplifier in standard digital CMOS with 70dB DC gain over a 2Vpp output swing range. Test results of fabricated chips confirmed better than 90dB operating-point DC gain, > =60dB DC gain over 2Vpp. It has nearly 90 degrees of phase margin and 140MHz gain-bandwidth product when driving 1pF capacitive load with 1mA from 3.5V single supply. Both linear and nonlinear behaviors of the PFA are carefully studied in order to enhance and maintain high gain automatically. Inherent nonlinearity in its DC transfer curve is discovered and analyzed. Based on nonlinear dynamic systems and bifurcation theory, we predict bifurcation and hysteresis phenomena in the PFA. An algorithm, which can be implemented using simple digital logic, is developed to measure the PFA's open-loop stability as the bifurcation parameter changes. Parameter-tuning algorithms are constructed that systematically move the amplifier's operational point towards the bifurcation point, at which infinite DC gain happens. In order to compensate for the PFA's high sensitivity to process and temperature variations, flexible analog design integrating digital programmability and inexpensive and adaptive digital post-processing techniques are developed. This flexibility and post-processing capability could dramatically enhance the PFA's yield. Full corner simulation results over wide temperature range verify the bifurcation phenomena and the effectiveness of the control algorithms. It is shown that this amplifier can maintain high performance in the most advanced digital CMOS technology at very low voltage supplies. They also demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a robust PFA design with both high yield and high performance. Matching of critical components is the most fundamental property that is necessary in achieving high linearity performance of analog mixed-signal circuits. Although matching qualities in future advanced digital CMOS technology are forecast to deteriorate as feature sizes continue to shrink, there has not been significant progress in developing advanced matching layout strategies. Chapter 4 is devoted to addressing this issue. In this chapter, systematic mismatch error in integrated circuits due to gradient effects is modeled and analyzed. Three layout strategies with improved matching performance are proposed and summarized. The hexagonal tessellation pattern can cancel quadratic gradient errors with only 3 units for each device and has high area-efficiency when extended. Both the N th -order circular symmetry patterns and N th -order central symmetry patterns can cancel up to N th order gradient effects between two devices using 2 N unit cells for each one. Among these three techniques, the central symmetry patterns have the best-reported matching performance for Manhattan structures; the circular-symmetry patterns have the best theoretical matching performance; and the hexagonal tessellation pattern has high density and high structural stability. The N th -order central symmetry technique is compatible to all IC fabrication processes requiring no special design rules. Simulation results of these proposed techniques show better matching characteristics than other existing layout techniques under nonlinear gradient effects. Specifically, two pairs of P-poly resistors using 2 nd and 3 rd -order central symmetry patterns were fabricated and tested. Less than 0.04% mismatch and less than 0.002% mismatch were achieved for the 2 nd and the 3 rd -order structures, respectively.

We examined individual and mixture associations of PFAS on liver function biomarkers in a representative sample of Canadian adults. We explored the potential for effect modification by sex and body mass index, as well as by physical activity level which may attenuate the deleterious effect of PFAS on metabolic disorders. Methods We analyzed data from participants aged 20-74 from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. We used linear regression to examine associations between plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUDA on serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin. We used quantile g-computation to estimate associations with a PFAS mixture for each simultaneous, one-quartile change in PFAS concentrations. Results Each doubling of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, or PFNA concentrations was associated with higher AST, GGT, and ALP concentrations. Each doubling of PFOA concentrations was associated with 16.5\% (95\%CI: 10.4, 23.0) higher GGT concentrations among adults not meeting Canada's physical activity guidelines vs. 6.6\% (95\%CI: -1.6, 15.5) among those meeting these guidelines. Sex and BMI also modified some associations, though to a lesser extent. We did not observe associations between ALT and PFOA (1.2\% change; 95\%CI: -2.5, 4.9), PFOS (2.2\% change; 95\%CI: -0.8, 5.3), or PFHxS (1.5\% change; 95\%CI: -0.4, 3.4). We also did not observe consistent associations for PFDA and PFUDA or with total bilirubin. In quantile g-computation models, each simultaneous one-quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was positively associated with AST (7.5\% higher; 95\%CI: 4.0, 10.4), GGT (9.7\% higher; 95\%CI: 1.7, 17.0), and ALP (2.8\% higher; 95\%CI: 0.5, 5.4). Conclusion Higher plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA - both individually and as a mixture - were associated with higher serum concentrations of liver function biomarkers. These results contribute to emerging evidence suggesting that higher levels of physical activity appear to be protective against the hepatotoxic effects of PFOA.

Studies have shown that a single exposure to PFAS may provoke abnormal liver function; however, few studies have investigated the overall effect of PFAS mixtures. We aimed to investigate associations between exposure to PFAS mixtures and liver function indices and explore the relevant mechanisms. This study included 278 adult males from Guangzhou, China. Serum metabolite profiles were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. We applied weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression as well as Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to analyze the association of nine PFAS mixtures with 14 liver function indices. PFAS mixtures were positively associated with apolipoprotein B (APOB) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and negatively associated with direct bilirubin (DBIL) and total bilirubin (TBIL) in both the WQS and BKMR analyses. In addition, Spearman's correlation test showed individual PFAS correlated with APOB, GGT, TBIL, and DBIL, while there's little correlation between individual PFAS and other liver function indices. In linear regression analysis, PFHxS, PFOS, PFHpS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUdA were associated with APOB; PFOA, PFDA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFUdA were associated with GGT. Subsequently, a metabolome-wide association study and mediation analysis were combined to explore metabolites that mediate these associations. The mechanisms linking PFAS to APOB and GGT are mainly related with amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. High-dimensional mediation analysis showed that glycerophospholipids are the main markers of the association between PFAS and APOB, and that (R)-dihydromaleimide, Ile Leu, (R)-(+)-2pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, and L-glutamate are the main markers of the association between PFAS and GGT. In summary, overall associations between PFAS and specific indices of liver function were found using two statistical methods; the metabolic pathways and markers identified here may serve to prompt more detailed study in animal-based systems, as well as a similar detailed analysis in other populations.",,10.1016/j.envint.2023.108405,Liver,NA,,overall and individual associations between per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and liver function indices and the metabolic mechanism

Every IQR increase of PFOA was significantly associated with a 2.1-mg/dL increase in TC (95\% CI: 1.2, 3.0), a 1.3-mg/dL increase in TGs (95\% CI: 0.1, 2.4), and a 1.4-mg/dL increase in LDL-C (95\% CI: 0.6, 2.2). PFOS was also significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels, and the corresponding values were 2.6 (95\% CI: 1.5, 3.6) and 1.9 (95\% CI: 0.9, 3.0), respectively. Associations of PFOS and PFOA with HDL-C levels were largely null. For minor PFAS species, PFHxS was significantly associated with higher levels of HDL-C {[}0.8 (95\% CI: 0.5, 1.2)]. Inverse associations were observed between PFDA and TGs {[}-5.0 (95\% CI: -8.1, -1.9)] and between PFNA and TGs {[}-1.7 (95\% CI: -3.5, -0.02)], whereas a positive association was observed between PFDA and HDL-C {[}1.4 (95\% CI: 0.1, 2.7)]. Nonsignificant nonlinear dose-response relationships were identified for associations of PFOA and PFOS with certain blood lipids.DISCUSSION: PFOA and PFOS were significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels in adults. Whether these findings may translate into an ele-vated cardiovascular disease risk associated with PFAS exposure warrants further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11840",,10.1289/EHP11840,,NA,,associations between per and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposures and blood lipid levels among adultsa metaanalysis

Data extraction and quality assessment were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Summary and outlook: Four studies were included in this systematic review. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident stroke per 1-log unit increment in each serum PFAS were combined in the meta-analysis. The risk of development of stroke was not significantly associated with PFOA, PFOS, or PFNA exposure (PFOA: pooled odds ratio {[}OR]=1.001, 95 \% confidence interval {[}CI]=0.975-1.028, p=0.752), whereas a moderately lower risk was associated with PFHxS exposure without statistical significance (pooled OR=0.953, 95 \% CI=0.908-1.001, p=0.054). PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA exposure showed a neutral association, while PFHxS showed a possible inverse association with the risk of stroke. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Overall, the relationship between PFASs and hypertension risk remains controversial. We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between PFAS exposure and human risk of hypertension.We conducted a meta-analysis based on population-involving studies published from 1975 to 2023, which we collected from Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases.

Based on evidence from population epidemiological surveys, we conducted a meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to assess the correlation between PFASs exposure and hypertension. In this study, three databases of PubMed, Web of science, Embase were searched and 13 literatures with 81,096 participants were included. Literature heterogeneity was evaluated by I2 statistic, and the random effect model (I2 > 50\%) and fixed effect model (I2 < 50\%) were used to combine the studies in meta-analysis.

Objective: The goal of this systematic review was to determine the size of the association between a doubling in perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) serum concentration and difference in log(e) antibody concentration following a vaccine, with a focus on five PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). Data source: We conducted online searches of PubMed and Web of Science through May 17, 2022 and identified 14 eligible reports published from 2012 to 2022. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: We included studies conducted in humans, including mother-child pairs, which examined serum PFAS concentration in relation to serum concentration of antibody to a specific antigen following a vaccine. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: We used the risk of bias assessment for non-randomized studies of exposure and certainty assessment method proposed by Morgan et al. (2019). Using a multilevel meta-regression model, we quantitatively synthesized the data. Results: The 14 reports represented 13 unique groups of subjects; the frequency of studies of a given antibody was Tetanus (n = 7); followed by Diphtheria (6); Measles (4); Rubella (3); Haemophilus influenzae type b and Influenza A H1N1 (2 each); and Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Influenza A H2N3, Influenza B, and Mumps (1 each). There were approximately 4,830 unique participants included in the analyses across the 14 reports. The models of coefficients between antibody concentration and the five principal PFAS showed homogeneity of associations across antibody types for each principal PFAS. In the models with all antibodies treated as one type, evidence of effect modification by life stage was present for PFOA and PFOS, and for consistency, all associations were evaluated for all ages and for children. The summary associations (coefficients for difference in log(e){[}antibody concentration] per doubling of serum PFAS) with 95\% confidence intervals that excluded zero ({''}statistical support{''}), and certainty of evidence ratings were as follows: for PFOA and all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.10, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.16, -0.03; moderate); for Diphtheria in children, -0.12 (-0.23, -0.00; high); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.17, -0.01; moderate), and for Tetanus in children, -0.12 (-0.24, -0.00; moderate). For PFOS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.11, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.18, -0.03; moderate); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.15, -0.03; high) and in children, -0.12 (-0.20, -0.04; high). For PFHxS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.03 (-0.06, -0.00; moderate) and in children, -0.05 (-0.09, -0.00; low); and for Rubella in children, -0.07 (-0.11, -0.02; high). Summary associations for PFNA and PFDA did not have statistical support, but all PFAS studied tended to have an inverse association with antibody concentrations. Limitations and conclusions: Epidemiologic data on immunosuppression and five principal PFAS suggest an association, with support across antibodies against multiple types of antigens. Data on Diphtheria, Rubella, and Tetanus were more supportive of an association than for other antibodies, and support was greater for associations with PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, than for PFNA or PFDA. The data on any specific antibody were scarce. Confounding factors that might account for the relation were not identified.

Results: Twenty-five relevant studies involving 30079 participants were finally selected from four databases. The combined estimates indicate that prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and perfluoroenanthic acid (PFHpA) is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (PFOA: OR = 1.45, 95\%CI: 1.07-1.94, P = 0.015; PFHxS: OR = 1.16, 95\%CI: 1.00-1.36, P = 0.055; PFBS: OR = 1.44, 95\%CI: 1.16-1.79, P = 0.001; PFHpA: OR = 1.41, 95\%CI: 1.10-1.82, P = 0.008).

Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Mummichog and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Significance across cohorts was determined using weighted Z-tests.RESULTS: In the SOLAR and CHS cohorts, PFAS exposure was associated with alterations in tyrosine metabolism (meta-analysis p = 0.00002) and de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (p = 0.03), among others. For example, when increasing all PFAS in the mixture from low ( 30th percentile) to high ( 70th percentile), thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone related to tyrosine metabolism, increased by 0.72 standard deviations (SDs; equivalent to a standardized mean difference) in the SOLAR cohort (95\% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 0.00, 1.20) and 1.60 SD in the CHS cohort (95\% BCI: 0.39, 2.80). Similarly, when going from low to high PFAS exposure, arachidonic acid increased by 0.81 SD in the SOLAR cohort (95\% BCI: 0.37, 1.30) and 0.67 SD in the CHS cohort (95\% BCI: 0.00, 1.50). In general, no individual PFAS appeared to drive the observed associations. DISCUSSION: Exposure to PFAS is associated with alterations in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in adolescents and young adults. https:// doi.org/10.1289/EHP11372",,10.1289/EHP11372,Cohort Studies;Adolescent,NA,,metabolic signatures of youth exposure to mixtures of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances a multicohort study

Methods We conducted two systematic reviews of age at menarche and PFOA, PFOS, PCBs and DDE/DDT based on publications indexed by pubmed. Results 16 unique reports were identified. Most studies of PFOA and PFOS reported either no association or delays in the age at menarche; only one reported an earlier age. Studies of DDT and DDE were more mixed. Reports on PCBs varied by PCB congener group with an equal number of them reporting delays and no association but one an acceleration. Sources of variation in results include the timing of exposure assessment (prenatal vs. postnatal), level of the toxicant, and sample size. No obvious pattern to the variation in results could be tied to those sources of variation. Conclusion The absence of consistent evidence from multiple reports of earlier age at menarche suggests that these toxicants may not be responsible for accelerated sexual maturation in girls. However, human populations naturally vary in the variety and levels of exposure, making the comparison of studies difficult.

This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations.Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for rele-vant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (>= 18 years old) and children. Primary find-ings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between con-centrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were per-formed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool.Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associa-tions between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations.Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human popula-tions.

Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of PFAS on female fertility based on population evidence.Methods: Electronic searches of the Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were conducted (from inception to March 2022) to collect observational studies related to PFAS and female fertility. Two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted information and evaluated the risk of bias for the included studies, meta-analysis was performed using R software.Results: A total of 5468 records were searched and 13 articles fully met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was negatively associated with the female fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.88, 95\% confidence interval (Cl) {[}0.78; 0.98]) and positively associated with the odds ratio for infertility (OR = 1.33, 95\%Cl {[}1.03; 1.73]).

Intoxication caused by organochlorines can cause serious health compromises that can lead to death. However, the organochlorines molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, researching about this topic is necessary to propose new therapeutic strategies. This study presents a bioinformatics approach to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved in organochlorines exposure using strategies based in support vector machines with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) followed by an enrichment pathway analysis with null-diffusion. Methods: five groups of HepG2 cells were exposed to aldrin, DDT, endosulfan, lindane, and a mixture of them. A control group with dimethyl sulfoxide was included. A metabolomic analysis was done using GC/MS-TOF, followed by SVM-RFE and a pathway analysis using FELLA in order to identify relevant metabolites and metabolic pathways affected. Genes reported by FELLA were introduced in gene ontology platform (GO) to estimate cellular components where reactions associated to organochlorines occur. Results: 153 metabolites were identified in metabolomic analysis. SVM-RFE was trained with the datasets and the top ten metabolites for each organochlorine were determined. Pentose phosphate and the central carbon metabolism in cancer were identified by FELLA as common pathways for all organochlorines.

Following regulatory bans on the production and emission of PFOA, concerns have been raised about the potential health risks and the safety of novel perfluoroalkyl analogues. HFPO-DA (trade name Gen-X) and HFPO-TA are two perfluoroalkyl analogues known to be bioaccumulative, whose level of toxicity and whether they are safe alternatives to PFOA remain unclear. In the following study, the physiological and metabolic effects of exposure to PFOA and its novel analogues were explored in zebrafish using 1/3 LC50 (PFOA 100 mu M, Gen-X 200 mu M, HFPO-TA 30 mu M). At the same LC50 toxicological effect, exposure to PFOA and HFPO-TA resulted in abnormal phenotypes such as spinal curvature, pericardial edema and aberrant body length, while Gen-X was little changed. Metabolically, PFOA, HFPO-TA and Gen-X all significantly increased total cholesterol in exposed zebrafish with PFOA and HFPO-TA also increasing total triglyceride levels. Transcriptome analysis showed that the number of differentially expressed genes in PFOA, Gen-X, and HFPO-TA treated conditions compared to control groups were 527, 572, and 3, 933, respectively. KEGG and GO analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed pathways and functions related to lipid metabolism as well as significant activation of the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPARs) pathway. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis identified significant dysregulation in the downstream target genes of PPAR alpha, which is responsible for lipid oxidative catabolism, and the SREBP pathway, which is responsible for lipid synthesis.

To provide a comprehensive synopsis and show the gaps and gluts of existing research on PFAS exposure in wildlife, we created a systematic map and bibliographic analysis of the literature. We followed our protocol to conduct a systematic literature search on Scopus, Web of Science and five other databases. In two steps (title/abstract/keywords and full-text), we screened peer-reviewed empirical articles, preprints and theses in English that studied the concentration of at least one of 34 PFAS compounds in free-ranging wildlife or their parts/products. Following the protocol, we extracted data and performed a critical appraisal. We included 581 publications. From the first and only paper in 2001, there was a linear annual increase to 54 papers in 2021. While PFOS (97\% of studies), PFOA (91\%) and long-chain PFAS in general were the most measured, few studies investigated new-generation PFAS (e.g. GenX and ADONA). Across the studied 1042 species from 26 taxonomic classes, the most frequent were the common carp (Cyprinus carpio, 8\%), polar bear (Ursus maritimus, 6\%) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis, 5\%).

Polar regions attracted significant research interest from countries all around the globe. Aquatic habitats (marine: 31\%, freshwater: 28\%) of temperate zones were the most common locations for sample collection. We encourage researchers to work towards closing the following gaps: investigating new-generation PFAS, assessing PFAS in mid- and low-income countries and performing more long-term studies, especially on invertebrates. We note the recent rise in studies on the physiological consequences of PFAS exposure and encourage further work on this crucial topic.

We excluded studies on temporal trends or providing estimates of half-life based solely on renal clearance. As persistent and ongoing exposures can influence half-life estimation, we decided to include only studies that were conducted after the main source of exposure to PFAS had ceased. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on studies that reported perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) or perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) half-life estimation. Risk of bias was evaluated using the OHAT tool. Results: A total of 13 articles were included in the review, with 5 studies conducted in exposed general populations and 8 studies conducted in exposed workers; the estimated mean half-life ranged from 1.48 to 5.1 years for PFOA, from 3.4 to 5.7 years for total PFOS, and from 2.84 to 8.5 years for PFHxS. High heterogeneity among studies was observed; potential reasons include the variability among the investigated populations, discrepancies in considering ongoing exposures, variability in PFAS isomeric compositions, accounting for background exposure, time since exposure stopped and methods used for half-life estimation. Discussion: Despite the efforts made to better understand PFAS toxicokinetics, further studies are needed to identify important characteristics of these persistent chemicals. Biomonitoring studies should focus on persistent and unaccounted sources of exposure to PFAS and on individual characteristics potentially determining half-life, to ensure accurate estimates.",,10.1016/j.envres.2023.117743,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,NA,,estimation of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas halflives in human studies a systematic review and metaanalysis

Multiple PFAS are associated with adverse liver outcomes in adult humans and toxicological models, but effects on the developing liver are not fully described. Here we performed transcriptomic analyses in the mouse to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatic toxicity in the dam and its fetus after exposure to two different PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its replacement, hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA, known as GenX). Pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed via oral gavage from embryonic day (E) 1.5-17.5 to PFOA (0, 1, or 5 mg/kg-d) or GenX (0, 2, or 10 mg/kg-d). Maternal and fetal liver RNA was isolated (N = 5 per dose/group) and the transcriptome analyzed by Affymetrix Array. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and differentially enriched pathways (DEP) were obtained. DEG patterns were similar in maternal liver for 5 mg/kg PFOA, 2 mg/kg GenX, and 10 mg/kg GenX (R2: 0.46-0.66). DEG patterns were similar across all 4 dose groups in fetal liver (R2: 0.59-0.81). There were more DEGs in fetal liver compared to maternal liver at the low doses for both PFOA (fetal = 69, maternal = 8) and GenX (fetal = 154, maternal = 93). Upregulated DEPs identified across all groups included Fatty Acid Metabolism, Peroxisome, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Adipogenesis, and Bile Acid Metabolism. Transcriptome-phenotype correlation analyses demonstrated > 1000 maternal liver DEGs were significantly correlated with maternal relative liver weight (R2 >0.92). These findings show shared biological pathways of liver toxicity for PFOA and GenX in maternal and fetal livers in CD-1 mice. The limited overlap in specific DEGs between the dam and fetus suggests the developing liver responds differently than the adult liver to these chemical stressors.

Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standards were followed during the meta-analysis. PubMed, Wed of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases were used to identify suitable articles before June 2023. The 95\% CI and 0 values were calculated to assess the association between male sex hormone levels and PFAS exposure. Heterogeneity among the included studies was tested using inconsistency statistics (I2). Results: The literature search identified 12 published articles that met our search criteria, involving 7506 participants. Our results revealed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposures were negatively correlated with testosterone (0 = -0.05; 95\% CI: -0.09, -0.02, P = 0.003) and (0 = -0.04; 95\% CI: -0.08, 0.00, P = 0.049), respectively.

Environmental chemicals are one of the drivers of such disturbances. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-specifically, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy) propanoic acid (GenX)-on the microbiome of the small intestine and colon, as well as on liver metabolism. Male CD-1 mice were exposed to PFOS and GenX in different concentrations and compared to controls. GenX and PFOS were found to have different effects on the bacterial community in both the small intestine and colon based on 16S rRNA profiles. High GenX doses predominantly led to increases in the abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto, Alistipes, and Ruminococcus, while PFOS generally altered Lactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Staphylococcus, and Ligilactobacillus. These treatments were associated with alterations in several important microbial metabolic pathways in both the small intestine and colon. Untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis of the liver, small intestine, and colon yielded a set of compounds significantly altered by PFOS and GenX. In the liver, these metabolites were associated with the important host metabolic pathways implicated in the synthesis of lipids, steroidogenesis, and in the metabolism of amino acids, nitrogen, and bile acids.

In this review, recent advances in the abatement of PFAS from water using photo-oxidation and photo -reduction are systematically reviewed. Degradation mechanisms of PFAS by photo-oxidation involving the holes (h(vb)(+)) and oxidative radicals and photo-reduction using the electrons (e(cb)(-)) and hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)) are inte-grated. The recent development of innovative heterogeneous photocatalysts and photolysis systems for enhanced degradation of PFAS is highlighted. Photodegradation mechanisms of alternative compounds, such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), are also critically evaluated.

Suresh",,,,,"Lindane or gamma- hexachlorocyclohexane (\& gamma;-HCH) isomer has been one of the most extensively used pesticides worldwide. However, four additional Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers were produced during its manufacture, resulting in persistence in the environment due to their dissolvability and noxiousness. This study examines the sequential anaerobic-aerobic degradation of synthetically prepared solution of technical HCH (tHCH) utilizing a hybrid reactor system with a UASB reactor coupled to the aerobic system. The ideal conditions for t-HCH degradation were initial substrate concentration (100 mg L- 1), glucose as suitable electron donor, active biomass (12 g L-1), pH (neutral range), HRT (48 h) and organic loading rate (4.28 mg/g/day). Individual reactor findings demonstrated that the UASB reactor performed efficiently with these parameters, showing 90.03\% degradation of 100 mg L-1 t-HCH in two days after a month of operation. In aerobic degradation, the selected isolate can break down 87\% of 100 mg L-1 of t-HCH in eight days. Subsequent to individual reactor operations, the reactors were synchronized in the hybrid reactor and after 60 days of continuous operation, tHCH was dechlorinated completely in the presence of glucose as a co-substrate. Therefore, compared to individual anaerobic and aerobic treatments, this sequential degradation showed an improvement in HCH removal efficiency of > 99\%. This is the first study that demonstrates the mineralization of HCH intermediates in a hybrid reactor system.

Objectives: To investigate associations between PFAS exposure and incident CVD (a combined CVD end-point consisting of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or heart failure) in two independent population-based cohorts in Sweden. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis also including results from previous studies. Methods: In 2,278 subjects aged 45-75 years from the EpiHealth study, the risk of incident CVD in relation to relative plasma levels of perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was investigated. Associations between plasma levels of six PFAS and incident CVD were also examined in the PIVUS-study (n = 1,016, all aged 70 years). In addition, a meta-analysis was performed including three previous prospective studies, together with the results from the present study. Results: There were no overall statistically significant associations between levels of the different PFAS and incident CVD, neither in EpiHealth nor in PIVUS. However, there was a significant sex interaction for PFOS in EpiHealth (p = 0.008), and an inverse association could be seen only in men (Men, HR: 0.68, 95 \% CI: 0.52, 0.89) (Women, HR: 1.13, 95 \% CI: 0.82, 1.55). A meta-analysis of five independent studies regarding PFOA and incident CVD showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.80 (CI: 0.66, 0.94) when high levels were compared to low levels. Conclusions: This longitudinal study using data from two population-based cohort studies in Sweden did not indicate any increased risk of incident CVD for moderately elevated PFAS levels.

The substances have been associated with adverse health outcomes in both pregnant mothers and infants, including pre-eclampsia and low birthweight. A growing body of research suggests that PFAS are transferred from mother to fetus through the placenta, leading to in utero exposure. A systematic review was performed using the PubMed database to search for studies evaluating determinants of PFAS concentrations in blood matrices of pregnant mothers and neonates shortly after birth. Studies were included in this review if an observational study design was utilized, exposure to at least one PFAS analyte was measured, PFAS were measured in maternal or neonatal matrices, at least one determinant of PFAS concentrations was assessed, and results such as beta estimates were provided. We identified 35 studies for inclusion in the review and evaluated the PFAS and determinant relationships among the factors collected in these studies. Parity, breastfeeding history, maternal race and country of origin, and household income had the strongest and most consistent evidence to support their roles as determinants of certain PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers. Reported study findings on smoking status, alcohol consumption, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) suggest that these factors are not important determinants of PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers or neonates. Further study into informative factors such as consumer product use, detailed dietary information, and consumed water sources as potential determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is needed. Research on determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is critical to estimate past PFAS exposure, build improved exposure models, and further our understanding on dose-response relationships, which can influence epidemiological studies and risk assessment evaluations.

Parameters of interest included the following: sampling dates and locations, numbers of collection sites and participants, detection frequencies, and occurrence statistics. Detailed data were extracted on PFAS occurrence in indoor and environmental media from 229 references and on PFAS occurrence in human matrices where available from those references. Studies of PFAS occurrence became numerous after 2005. Studies were most abundant for PFOA (80\% of the references) and PFOS (77\%). Many studies analyzed additional PFAS, particularly, PFNA and PFHxS (60\% of references each). Food (38\%) and drinking water (23\%) were the commonly studied media. Most studies found detectable levels of PFAS, and detectable levels were reported in a majority of states in the United States. Half or more of the limited studies for indoor air and products detected PFAS in 50\% or more of the collected samples. The resulting databases can inform problem formulation for systematic reviews to address specific PFAS exposure queries and questions, support prioritization of PFAS sampling, and inform PFAS exposure measurement studies. The search strategy should be extended and implemented to support living evidence review in this rapidly advancing area.",,10.1021/acs.est.2c07185,,NA,,systematic evidence mapping of potential exposure pathways for per and polyfluoroalkyl substances based on measured occurrence in multiple media

Because of their high detection frequency, persistence, and potential toxicity, interest in both PFOA and PFOS has increased in recent years. However, a substantial number of PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests only report nominal, or unmeasured, treatment concentrations, which may complicate the determination of protective values. In addition, previous literature has indicated that differences between nominal and measured concentrations of both PFOA and PFOS could be linked to experimental conditions (e.g., feeding regimes for test organisms, test vessel material {[}glass or plastic], use of solvent, and the presence of substrate). Therefore, this critical review examined whether nominal and measured concentrations were in close agreement with each other among the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature and if experimental conditions were associated with any observed differences. Nominal and measured concentrations in the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature generally displayed a high degree of linear correlation and relatively low median percent differences. Correlations between measured and nominal concentrations were >0.98 for PFOA and >0.95 for PFOS in freshwater tests across experimental conditions. For saltwater tests, correlations of >0.84 were observed for PFOA and PFOS (separate and combined) across experimental conditions. While measured PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests are generally preferred, the present meta-analysis demonstrated that experimental conditions had little influence on observed discrepancies between nominal and measured concentrations, with the exception of PFOS saltwater tests and PFOA and PFOS freshwater studies that contained substrate. Unmeasured tests with these conditions should be considered carefully based on project needs, with the caveat that the data sets for these two experimental conditions were limited.

We examined the associations between maternal PFAS exposure and maternal glucose metabolisms and GDM risk among 1601 mothers who joined the Hyperglycaemia-and-Adverse-Pregnancy-Outcome (HAPO) Study in Hong Kong in 2001-2006. All mothers underwent a 75 g-oral-glucose-tolerance test at 24-32 weeks of gestation. We measured serum concentrations of six PFAS biomarkers using high-performance liquid-chromatography-coupled-withtandem-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). We fitted conventional and advanced models (quantile-g-computation {[}qgcomp] and Bayesian-kernel machine regression {[}BKMR]) to assess the associations of individual and a mixture of PFAS with glycaemic traits. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the enrollment period by the severe - acute -respiratory -syndrome (SARS) epidemic periods in Hong Kong between March 2003 and May 2004. PFOS and PFOA were the main components of PFAS mixture among 1601 pregnant women in the Hong Kong HAPO study, with significantly higher median PFOS concentrations (19.09 ng/mL), compared to Chinese pregnant women (9.40 ng/mL) and US women (5.27 ng/mL).

The objective of this study was to know the effects of PFASs on microbial communities and their functional genes from source water to tap water. PFASs were detected by mass-labeled internal standards method, and the microbial communities and functional genes were analyzed by meta-genomics. Our results indicated that the concentration of total PFASs in the water ranged from 47.7 to 171.4 ng/ L, with perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) being the dominant types. The PFASs concentration decreased slowly from source to tap water in some months. PFBA, PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) influenced the functional genes related to two-component system, bacterial secretion system and flagellar assembly of Aquabacterium, Methylobacterium, and Curvibacter, which contributed significantly to macB and evgS. Therefore, the bacterial communities enhanced adaptation to fluctuating environments by upregulating some functional genes under the PFASs stress, with concomitant changes in the expression of ARGs. Moreover, PFASs also promoted the expression of functional genes associated with human diseases, such as shigellosis and tuberculosis, which increased the risk of human pathogenicity. The bench scale experiment results also suggested that PFOA and PFOS in drinking water can promote the ARGs proliferation and induce microbial risk. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to prevent the risks caused by PFASs and ARGs in drinking water.",,10.1016/j.watres.2023.120831,,NA,,the perfluoroalkyl substances influenced the distribution of bacterial communities and their functions from source water to tap water

A large number of studies using different approaches provide evidence regarding effects of environmental exposures, encompassed in the exposome, on children's health. We aimed to summarize the overall level of evidence (LoE) from all streams of evidence regarding exposome effects on child health. For 88 selected chemical and urban factors, we retrieved the conclusions of agency reports or literature reviews published between 2015 and 2021 regarding effects on child health, including cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodevelopmental, respiratory and other health outcomes. Adapted versions of PRISMA flowchart and AMSTAR-2 tool were used to select and assess the quality of the systematic reviews retrieved from PubMed and SCOPUS databases. For each factor-outcome pair, conclusions in three streams of evidence (epidemiological, toxicological and mechanistic, the latter corresponding to in vitro and in silico approaches) were translated into stream-specific LoEs and then combined into an overall LoE ranging from ``very unlikely{''} to ``very likely{''}. The 88 environmental factors were implied in 611 factor-outcome pairs. Forty-four pairs (7\%), corresponding to 16 factors, had a very likely overall LoE (>= 80\%); 127 pairs (21\%), corresponding to 49 factors, had a likely or more overall LoE (>= 60\%). For 81 pairs (13\%), no evidence was available in agency reports or published reviews, while for 275 pairs (45\%), corresponding to 68 factors, the overall LoE was very unlikely (<20\%).

A growing number of evidence shows that skin exposure is an important intake pathway for human to absorb emerging pollutants. The skin permeability of pollutants is mainly reflected by the skin permeability coefficient and permeation flux. In vivo or in vitro experiments with human and animal models are the main means to determine the transdermal characteristics of emerging pollutants. However, these methods have many disadvantages such as high cost, time-consuming, large differences, and ethics. It is difficult to accurately estimate the skin exposure risk of emerging pollutants. Therefore, it is necessary to build up a skin permeability prediction mathematical model to assess the exposure and health risks of emerging pollutants. This article systematically reviews the research progress on the application of the skin permeability prediction model in the health risk assessment of emerging pollutants. At first, the basic structure of the skin and the main transdermal absorption pathways of emerging pollutants are introduced. Secondly, the basic principles and applications of existing skin permeability prediction models are summarized. The QSAR model and PBTK model were described according to the ratio of penetration to exposure dose. The QSAR model is described in detail to establish a regular model to predict the permeability of chemical pollutants in the skin by linking the structure and physicochemical characteristics of chemical substances with skin permeability. The accuracy of the results depends on the reliability of the modeling data. The PBTK model can be divided into the single-compartment model and the two-compartment model according to the characteristics of skin structure. And we summarized the application of the PBTK model on exposure risk assessment for industry workers or consumers. Moreover, we clarified the application of permeability prediction models in exposure risk and human health risk assessment and prospected the future research direction on dermal exposure risk assessment of emerging pollutants. The skin permeability prediction model optimizes the exposure parameters of daily skin exposure in risk assessment by predicting the skin permeability coefficient or permeability of emerging pollutants, to accurately assess the human exposure and health risk of emerging pollutants. At the end of this research progress, the future research objectives of skin permeability prediction models are pointed out: Improving the accuracy of data and considering the effect of skin esterase on skin permeability in prediction models.",,10.1360/TB-2022-1115,Risk Assessment;Permeability,NA,,research progress on the application of skin permeability prediction model in health risk assessment of emerging pollutants

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of widely used industrial chemicals, are characterized by persistence, long-distance migration, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Some PFAS, particularly perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), have been banned, leaving only legacy exposure to the environment and human body, while a number of novel PFAS alternatives have emerged and raised concerns, such as polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic and carboxylic acid (PFESA and PFECA) and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS). Overall, this review systematically elucidated the adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of legacy and emerging PFAS, emphasized the dose/concentration-dependent, time-dependent, carbon chain length-dependent, sex-specific, and coexposure effects, and discussed the underlying mechanisms and possible prevention and treatment. Extensive epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggests that accumulated serum levels of legacy PFAS possibly contribute to an increased risk of CVD and its subclinical course, such as cardiac toxicity, vascular disorder, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The underlying biological mechanisms may include oxidative stress, signaling pathway disturbance, lipid metabolism disturbance, and so on. Various emerging alternatives to PFAS also play increasingly prominent toxic roles in CV outcomes that are milder, similar to, or more severe than legacy PFAS.

We found that maternal PFASs exposure was positively correlated with PTB (OR:1.13, 95\% CI:1.04-1.23), SGA (OR:1.10, 95\% CI:1.04-1.16) and miscarriage (OR:1.09, 95\% CI:1.00-1.19). The pooled estimates also showed maternal PAEs exposure was linked with PTB (OR:1.16, 95\% CI:1.11-1.21), SGA (OR:1.20, 95\% CI:1.07-1.35) and miscarriage (OR:1.55, 95\% CI:1.33-1.81). In addition, maternal exposure to some specific class of EDCs including PFOS, MBP, MEHP, DEHP, and BPA was associated with PTB. Maternal exposure to PFOS, PFOA, PFHpA was associated with SGA. Maternal exposure to BPA was associated with LBW. Maternal exposure to MMP, MEHP, MEHHP, MEOHP, BPA was associated with miscarriage. Maternal PFASs, PAEs and BPA exposure may increase adverse pregnancy outcomes risk according to our study.

Using estimates of the specific gestational week of sampling, the meta-regression showed results consistent with the categorical sample analysis, in that as gesta-tional age at sampling time increases across these studies, the summary effect estimate of a mean BWT deficit got larger. Overall, we detected mean BWT deficits for PFNA that were larger and more consistent across studies than previous PFAS meta-analyses. Compared to studies with later sampling, BWT deficits were smaller but remained sizeable for even the earliest sampling periods.

It has currently been identified in the environment and human bodies; nonetheless, the possible toxicities are not well-known. Zebrafish have been used as a toxicant screening model due to their fast and transparent developmental pro-cesses. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PFHxS for five days, and various experiments were performed to monitor the developmental and cellular processes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/ MS) analysis confirmed that PFHxS was absorbed and accumulated in the zebrafish embryos. We reported that 2.5 mu M or higher PFHxS exposure induced phenotypic abnormalities, marked by developmental delay in the mid -hind brain boundary and yolk sac edema. Additionally, larvae exposed to PFHxS displayed facial malformation due to the reduction of neural crest cell expression. RNA sequencing analysis further identified 4643 differen-tiated expressed transcripts in 5 mu M PFHxS-exposed 5-days post fertilization (5-dpf) larvae. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, as well as oxidative stress were enriched in the PFHxS-exposed larvae. To validate these findings, a series of biological experiments were conducted. PFHxS exposure led to a nearly 4-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, possibly due to hyperglycemia and impaired glutathione balance. The Oil Red O' staining and qPCR analysis strengthens the notions that lipid metabolism was disrupted, leading to lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and malondialdehyde formation. All these al-terations ultimately affected cell cycle events, resulting in S and G2/M cell cycle arrest.

However, PFBS toxicity in the mammalian gut remains unclear. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 10 mu g/L and 500 mu g/L PFBS or 500 mu g/L PFOS in their water supply for 28 days. PFBS toxicity in the ileum and colon was explored and com-pared to that of PFOS. Biochemical analysis showed that tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-1f3 (IL-1f3) levels increased in the ileum exposed to 10 mu g/L PFBS, whereas no significant changes were observed in those levels in the colon. Catalase (CAT) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), TNF-a, and IL-1f3 levels increased and glutathione (GSH) levels decreased in the ileum of the 500 mu g/L-PFBS group, whereas only MDA levels increased in the colon of the 500 mu g/L-PFBS group. The results showed that more severe damage occurred in the ileum than in the colon after PFBS exposure, and these align with the 500 mu g/L-PFOS group exposure as well. Furthermore, metabolomic anal-ysis revealed glutathione metabolism as a vital factor in inducing PFBS and PFOS toxicities in the ileum. Steroid hor-mone and amino acid metabolisms were other important factors involved in PFBS and PFOS toxicities, respectively. In the colon, GSH, pyrimidine, and glucose (especially galactose) metabolism was the main contributor to PFBS toxicity, and sulfur amino acid metabolism was the main pathway for PFOS toxicity.

The review included 37 total articles, including 9 animal studies and 1 human study measuring the direct contribution of exposure of the infant or pup through milk for any health outcome. Animal studies provided evidence of associations between exposure to PFOA through breastfeeding and reduced early life body weight gain, mammary gland development, and thyroid hormone levels. They also provided limited evidence of associations between PFOS exposure through breastfeeding with reduced early life body weight gain and cellular changes in the hippocampus. The direct relevance of any of these outcomes to human health is uncertain, and it is possible that many adverse health effects of exposure through breastfeeding have not yet been studied.

Howbeit, the current literature lacks a comprehensive and comparative overview of the various degradation pathways and mechanisms. This systematic review compiles and analyzes the mechanisms and degradation pathways of PFAS by persulfate activation, photocatalysis, UV/sulfite, electron beam, electrochemical oxidation, plasma, ozonation, and sonochemical oxidation. We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C-C and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts) affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate group). This study lays the groundwork for future research to analyze and elucidate the transformation products and pathways of PFAS in various treatment systems.",,10.1016/j.cej.2022.138352,Oxidation-Reduction,NA,,mechanisms and pathways of pfas degradation by advanced oxidation and reduction processes a critical review

Accumulated evidence implies that GenX exposure might exert adverse health effects, although the underlying mechanisms have not been fully revealed. In this study, pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to GenX (2 mg/kg/day), PFOA (1 mg/kg/day), or Milli-Q water by gavage from the first day of gestation (GD0) until GD21. Necropsy and tissue collection were conducted in pups at 4 weeks of age. PFOA and GenX induced similar histopathological changes in both the liver and the intestinal mucosa, accompanied by higher serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase. Moreover, the capacity of hepatic glycogen storage and intestinal mucus secretion were significantly decreased, suggesting dysfunction of liver metabolism and the intestinal mucosal barrier. A total of 637 and 352 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the liver tissues of GenX and PFOA group, respectively. Most of the enriched pathways from the DEGs by KEGG enrichment analysis were metabolism-associated. Moreover, overexpression of CYP4A14, Sult2a1, Cpt1b, Acaa1b, Igfbp1, Irs-2 and decreased expression of Gys2 wereobserved in livers of GenX exposed pups, supporting the hypothesis that there was metabolic disruption. Furthermore, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest proteins (Gadd45 beta, p21, Ppard) were significantly increased, while cell proliferation-related proteins (Cyclin E, Myc, EGFR) were decreased by gestational GenX exposure in the pups' liver. In addition, imbalance of gut microbiota and dysfunction of the intestinal mucosa barrier might contribute to hepatotoxicity at least in part. Taken together, our results suggested that gestational GenX exposure triggered metabolic disorder, which might be responsible for the hepatotoxicity in the pups in addition to dysfunction of the intestinal mucosa barrier.

Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide important conduits between waste sources and the environment. We present a meta-analysis of results reported in 44 peer-reviewed publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples, collected from 21 countries, for which some or all of five per-fluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were measured. Our meta analysis revealed global patterns and trends that, to our knowledge, have not been reported elsewhere. Regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the PFAS and the corresponding mean concentration for each country. Although legacy compounds, perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have been reported with the highest measured concentrations, their global temporal trends are lowest of all PFAS considered. Concentrations of most PFAS analyzed in wastewater in the United States have not changed significantly with time, whereas reported PFAS concentrations in wastewater effluent from China have increased from 11\% to 37\% per year. In addition, our results show significant positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent concentrations of individual PFAS and the gross domestic product per capita of each country. Our analysis of this global data set also confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets: (i) none of the PFAS studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes; (ii) effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher PFAS concentrations; and (iii) the few studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) indicate that PFAS adsorbed to SPM can contribute significantly to the total PFAS load.",,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118784,,NA,,global patterns and temporal trends of perfluoroalkyl substances in municipal wastewater a metaanalysis

Animal studies suggest that PFAS may increase risk of fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via impacts on hepatic lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, but human data is lacking. We examined associations between PFAS exposure, altered metabolic pathways, and risk of non-viral HCC. Methods: In this nested case-control study, pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS and metabolomics were measured in 50 incident HCC cases and 50 individually matched controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. Cases/controls were matched by age, sex, race, and study area. PFAS exposure and risk of HCC were examined using conditional logistic regression. A metabolome-wide association study and pathway enrichment analysis was performed for PFAS exposure and HCC risk, and key metabolites/metabolic pathways were identified using a meet in the middle approach. Results: High perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels (90th percentile from NHANES; > 55 lg/L) were associated with 4.5 -fold increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 4.5, 95\% CI 1.2-16.0). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PFOS exposure was associated with alterations in amino acid and glycan biosynthesis pathways, which were also associated with HCC risk. We identified 4 metabolites linking PFOS exposure with HCC, including glucose, butyric acid (a short-chain fatty acid), alpha-ketoisovaleric acid (a branched-chain a-keto acid), and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (a bile acid), each of which was positively associated with PFOS exposure and risk of HCC. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept analysis shows that exposure to high PFOS levels was associated with increased risk of non-viral HCC, likely via alterations in glucose, amino acid, and bile acid metabolism. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Lay summary: Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as ``forever chemicals `` because they are difficult to break down and stay in the human body for years, are extremely common and can cause liver damage. In a first of its kind study, we found that exposure to high levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, one of the most common PFAS chemicals, was linked to increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans.

Emerging evidence suggested that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have the potential to interfere with the function of normal hormones, may play a crucial role in this trend.

Objective and search methods: In our study, we sought to fully evaluate the currently available epidemiological evidence to ascertain whether certain EDC congeners and their metabolites are related to breast cancer risk. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in three electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Publications that covered xenobiotic EDC exposures and breast cancer-confirmed histological results or antecedent medical records or reporting to health registers were taken into consideration. Outcomes: The final result of the literature search was 6,498 references, out which we found 67 publications that matched the requirements for meta-analysis and eight publications for qualitative trend synthesis. In this meta-analysis, statistically significant associations revealed that (i) 1-chloro-4-{[}2,2,2-trichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene (p,p'-DDT) and its major metabolite 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were somewhat related to a greater risk of breast cancer. However, this relationship only existed in blood serum but not in adipose tissue. (ii) Breast cancer risk was increased by exposure to chlordane and hexachlorocyclohexane. (iii) Five polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 99, PCB 105, PCB 118, PCB 138, and PCB 183) can increase the risk of breast cancer. (iv) One phthalate congener (BBP) and one per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance congener (PFDoDA) were negatively associated with breast cancer risk.

We conducted study-specific multivariable linear regression analyses estimating the associations of metabolite levels with levels of PFOS or PFOA. For metabolites measured in at least 3 of 8 nested case-control studies, random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize study-specific results (1,038 metabolites in PFOS analyses and 1,100 in PFOA analyses). Results: The meta-analysis identified 51 and 38 metabolites associated with PFOS and PFOA, respectively, at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level (4.8x10-5 and 4.6x10-5, respectively). For both PFOS and PFOA, the most common types of associated metabolites were lipids (sphingolipids, fatty acid metabolites) and xenobiotics (xanthine metabolites, chemicals). Positive associations were commonly observed with lipid metabolites sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0) (P = 2.0x10-10 and 2.0x10-8, respectively), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpro-pionate (P = 2.7x10-15, 1.1x10-17), and lignoceroylcarnitine (C24) (P = 2.6x10-8, 6.2x10-6).

PFAS substances that have longer carbon chains, such as PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), can potentially pose a significant public health risk due to their ability to bioaccumulate and persist for long periods of time in the body and the environment. The National Academies Report suggests there is some evidence of PFOS exposure and gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation contributing to ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis are precursors to colorectal cancer. However, evidence about the association between PFOS and colorectal cancer is limited and has shown contradictory findings. This review provides an overview of population and preclinical studies on PFOS exposure and GI inflammation, metabolism, immune responses, and carcinogenesis. It also highlights some mitigation approaches to reduce the harmful effects of PFOS on GI tract and discusses the dietary strategies, such as an increase in soluble fiber intake, to reduce PFOS-induced alterations in cellular lipid metabolism. More importantly, this review demonstrates the urgent need to better understand the relationship between PFOS and GI pathology and carcinogenesis, which will enable development of better approaches for interventions in populations exposed to high levels of PFAS, and in particular to PFOS.",,10.3389/ftox.2023.1244457,Sulfones;Inflammation;Sulfonic Acids,NA,,the role of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos exposure in inflammation of intestinal tissues and intestinal carcinogenesis

Toxicological studies have suggested that exposure to PFASs may lead to several adverse effects, including infertility and cancer development. In light of their widespread use, the contamination of food products has created health concerns in sites directly influenced by industrial and anthropogenic activity. In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination. Short-chain PFAS are suggested as chemicals of emerging concern to food security. However, the environmental and toxicological implications of short-chain congeners are not fully understood and, thus, much research is needed in this sense.",,10.1007/s13197-022-05545-7,,NA,,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in consumable species and food products

However, PFASs conversion or conjugation to other substances in rice grown on PFASs polluted soil has not been explored clearly. These unknown transformed or conjugated products of PFOA and PFOS could be harmful to human health. The restriction factor in evaluating the possible transformation of PFOA and PFOS is mainly attributed to the lack of an efficient method for screening PFOA and PFOS and their related metabolites. To circumvent this challenge, we established a nontargeted screening method by combining a fluoro-cotton fiber-based solid phase extraction (FC-SPE) and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to monitor the formation of possible organic fluorine compounds from rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown on PFASs. We synthesized fluoro-cotton fibers to serve as the FC-SPE packing material and characterized by field-emission scanning electron-microscope, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The optimal extraction conditions for the prepared FC-SPE were investigated. The performance of FC-SPE in LC-MS analysis was validated by linearity, precision, recovery, and matrix effect. Then the FC-SPE combined with LC-HRMS was used to specifically capture organic fluorine compounds from complex matrices via F-F interaction, including rice seedlings grown in PFOA and PFOS polluted soil and soil samples. By the established FC-SPE LC-HRMS method, in total 429 features were found as the possible organic fluorine compounds from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil among the 1781 features from the rice seedlings. Finally, we employed a13C metabolic tracing analysis of organic fluorine compounds in combination with the FC-SPE LC-HRMS method to further identify the features that detected from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil.

PFASs occur in edible oil, an important component of the global diet, mainly in three ways: raw material contamination, process contamination, and migration from oil contact materials. Thus, the occurrence of PFAS in edible oils has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this work, the pertinent literature of the last two decades from the Web of Science database was researched. This review systematically addressed the potential sources, the contamination levels, and the progress of the determination of PFASs in edible oil.

Evidence suggests that exposure to POPs, which is ubiquitous, is associated with microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. miRNA are key regulators in many physiological processes. It is thus of public health concern to understand the relationships between POPs and miRNA as related to health outcomes. Objectives: This systematic review evaluated the relationship between widely recognized, intentionally manufactured, POPs, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane {[}DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene {[}DDE], hexachlorobenzene {[}HCB]), with miRNA expression in both human and animal studies. Methods: We used PubMed and Embase to systematically search the literature up to September 29th, 2023. Search results for human and animal studies were included if they incorporated at least one POP of interest in relation to at least one miRNA. Data were synthesized to determine the direction and significance of associations between POPs and miRNA. We utilized ingenuity pathway analysis to review disease pathways for miRNA that were associated with POPs. Results: Our search identified 38 eligible studies: 9 in humans and 29 in model organisms. PFAS were associated with decreased expression of miR-19, miR-193b, and miR-92b, as well as increased expression of miR-128, miR199a-3p, and miR-26b across species.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases, and identified population-based epidemiological studies related to PFAS and glucolipid metabolism indexes that were published before 30 December 2022. The heterogeneity of the included literature was assessed using the I-square (I-2) test and statistics Q. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to combine the effect size.

Objectives This study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS with mortality and morbidity of diabetes and to quantitatively evaluate the summary effect estimates of the existing literature. Methods We searched three electronic databases for epidemiological studies concerning PFAS and diabetes published before April 1, 2022. Summary odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), or beta and their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were respectively calculated to evaluate the association between PFAS and diabetes using random-effects model by the exposure type, and dose-response meta-analyses were also performed when possible. We also assessed the risk of bias of the studies included and the confidence in the body of evidence. Results An initial literature search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 studies were eventually included. The meta-analyses indicated that the observed statistically significant PFAS-T2DM associations were consistent in cohort studies, while the associations were almost non-significant in case-control and cross-sectional studies. Dose-response meta-analysis showed a ``parabolic-shaped{''} association between perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) exposure and T2DM risk. Available evidence was rated with ``low{''} risk of bias, and the level of evidence for PFAS and incident T2DM was considered ``moderate{''}. Conclusions Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure may increase the risk of incident T2DM, and that PFOA may exert non-monotonic dose-response effect on T2DM risk. Considering the widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects of PFAS, further cohort studies with improvements in expanding the sample size, adjusting the covariates, and considering different types of PFAS exposure at various doses, are needed to elucidate the putative causal associations and potential mode of action of different PFAS on diabetes. Impact Statement A growing body of evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the development of diabetes. However, epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS and diabetes is inconsistent. We performed this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to PFAS may increase diabetes risk among the general population.

We conducted a search matching specific keywords that was independently reviewed by two authors on two databases (EMBASE and PubMed) from their inception through July 19, 2022 following PRISMA guidelines.Recent FindingsWe identified a total of 28 eligible observational studies that evaluated the associations between 31 different PFAS exposures and metabolomics in humans. The most common exposure evaluated was legacy long-chain PFAS. Population sample sizes ranged from 40 to 1,105 participants at different stages across the lifespan. A total of 19 studies used a non-targeted metabolomics approach, 7 used targeted approaches, and 2 included both. The majority of studies were cross-sectional (n = 25), including four with prospective analyses of PFAS measured prior to metabolomics.Most frequently reported associations across studies were observed between PFAS and amino acids, fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, phosphosphingolipids, bile acids, ceramides, purines, and acylcarnitines. Corresponding metabolic pathways were also altered, including lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, nucleotide, energy metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. We found consistent evidence across studies indicating PFAS-induced alterations in lipid and amino acid metabolites, which may be involved in energy and cell membrane disruption.",,10.1007/s40726-023-00269-4,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,NA,,pfas exposures and the human metabolome a systematic review of epidemiological studies

Hypercaloric, high-fat diet is considered to promote the accumulation of toxic lipophilic substances in tissues, whereas the loss of body fat through caloric restriction results in a recirculation of these substances. In rats, oral administration of DDE causes the onset of tissues damage; the concomitant intake of a high-fat diet ameliorates tissues status, probably because of the entrapment of the lipophilic substance in fat depots. Recent evidence demonstrates that DDE alters the expression of metallothioneins, proteins involved in cellular defense from oxidative stress, in a diet- and tissue-specific manner. This study is aimed to verify if 2 weeks of caloric restriction after the oral DDE treatment can modify metallothionein gene expression in tissues of high-fat fed rats. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrates that metallothionein gene expression after calorie restriction is tissue-specific and strongly influenced by both previous dietary conditions and DDE exposure. To avoid misleading conclusions on the interference of toxic xenobiotics on metallothionein gene expression is particularly important to consider the tissue, the cellular conditions, and the nutritional status of the animals, especially when the protein is used as an index of cells health.",,10.1080/03601234.2022.2127594,Rats;Gene Expression,NA,,metallothionein gene expression in rat tissues response to dietary restriction after orally dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde exposure and highfat feeding

Adsorbents with large mesopores and high specific surface area adsorb PFAS faster, their adsorption capacities are higher, and the adsorption process are usually more effective under low pH conditions. PFAS adsorption mechanisms mainly include electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interaction, anion exchange, and ligand exchange. Various adsorbents show promising performances but challenges such as requirements of organic solvents in regeneration, low adsorption selectivity, and complicated adsorbent preparations should be addressed before large scale implementation. Moreover, the aid of decision-making tools including response surface methodology (RSM), techno-economic assessment (TEA), life cycle assessment (LCA), and multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) were discussed for engineering applications. The use of these tools is highly recommended prior to scale-up to determine if the specific adsorption process is economically feasible and sustainable.

The liver acts as a key target organ for toxicity within the body and is vital for regulating metabolic processes, particularly lipid metabolism. However, there is currently a significant research gap regarding the influences of PFBS on hepatic lipid metabolism, especially in individuals with different dietary statuses. Here, the objective of this research was to examine the effects of PFBS on hepatic function under different dietary conditions. The results suggested that the levels of liver injury biomarkers were significantly upregulated, e.g., transaminase (GPT, GOT), while liver lipid levels were downregulated after exposure to PFBS at concentration of 50 mu g/L for 42 days. Moreover, restricted diet further intensified the adverse effects of PFBS on the liver. Metabolomics analysis identified significant alterations in lipid-related metabolites in PFBS-induced hepatotoxicity, PFBS exposure induced a decrease in lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcho-line. PFBS exposure caused an increase in aldosterone and prostaglandin f2alpha under restricted diet. In PFBS treatment group, histidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis were the main pathway for PFBS toxicity.

Furthermore, health risks associated with PFAS in water are outlined. Finally, researchers worldwide have investigated the strategies for the remediation and elimination of PFAS from water. Previous studies have shown that PFASs are present in various water bodies with the highest concentration detected in Germany (94-4,385 ng center dot L-1 in river and drinking waters). The findings of this review further revealed that solid-phase extraction techniques were the most preferred for sample preparation compared to liquid-liquid extraction techniques. Solid-phase extraction technique improved the limit of detection and the limit of quantification of many analytical techniques to 0.010-1.15 and 0.030-4.00 ng center dot L-1, respectively. For PFAS remediation, the adsorption method and chemical oxidation using heat-activated persulfate and photochemical oxidation were the most used techniques.

Here, the PFOA-associated effects on immune system were evaluated in Ruditapes philippinarum using integrated analysis of metabolomes, microbiomes, and transcriptomes, providing evidence for possible mechanisms related to immunotoxicity. PFOA exposure caused clear variation in several important metabolites related to immune regulatory function within the haemolyph from R. philippinarum, while also altering key metabolic pathways, including those of lipids, unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), and bile acids (BAs). After exposure to PFOAs, intestinal bacterial communities also clearly changed, with the predominant microflora becoming Mycoplasma and Bacteroidetes that are related to intestinal inflammation. Molecular analyses provided consistent results, wherein the expression of immune related genes was significantly altered. Integration of the multi-'omics' analyses suggested that the TLR/MyD88/ NF-kB pathway, along with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, PPAR-mediated lipid metabolism and the autophagy signaling pathway, likely play important roles in initiating immunotoxic effects in R. philippinarum after PFOA exposure.

By analyzing 111 papers published between 2006 and 2022, we provide a systematic review of the pollution of PFASs in surface water environments in China. The results show that 26 PFASs contaminants were detected at least once in China's surface water environment and were mainly concentrated in the eastern part of China. Most surface water environments in China had mean PFASs concentrations below 100 ng/L. The most polluted place was the Xiaoqing River, where sampling results in 2020 showed PFASs concentrations as high as 25,429 ng/L, followed by the Tangxun Lake, the Xi River, the Daling River, the Majia River, the Baiyangdian Lake, the Liuxi River, the Jiaolai River, the Tuo River and the Zhimai River.

We excluded studies that only evaluated obesity measures at the time of birth. A full-text review and quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) criteria. Forest plots were created to summarize measures of association and assess heterogeneity across studies by chemical type and exposure timing. Funnel plots were used to assess small-study effects.ResultsWe identified 24 studies, of which 19 used a cohort design. There were 13 studies included in the meta-analysis examining various chemicals and outcomes. Overall prenatal exposures to four different types of PFAS were not statistically associated with changes in body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference. In contrast, for three chemicals, postnatal exposures were inversely related to changes in BMI (i.e., per log10 increase in PFOS: BMI z-score of -0.16 (95\% CI: -0.22, -0.10)). There was no substantial heterogeneity in the reported measures of association within prenatal and postnatal subgroups. We observed modest small-study effects, but correction for these effects using the Trim and Fill method did not change our summary estimate(s).ConclusionOur review found no evidence of a positive association between prenatal PFAS exposure and pediatric obesity, whereas an inverse association was found for postnatal exposure.

The evidence of the EPs' presence focuses on the detection of them, but there is a gap in information regarding is biomonitoring and their effects in health in Mexico. The presence of these pollutants in the country associated with lack of proper regulations in the discharge and disposal of EPs. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive view of the current environmental status, policies, and frameworks regarding Mexico's situation. The review also highlights the lack of information about biomonitoring since EPs are present in water even after their treatment, leading to a critical situation, which is high exposure to humans and animals. Although, technologies to efficiently eliminate EPs are available, their application has been reported only at a laboratory scale thus far. Here, an overview of health and environmental impacts and a summary of the research works reported in Mexico from 2014 to 2023 were presented.

The microbial communities in the environment are immensely diverse and critical mediators of various ecosystem processes. But it is not clearly known to what extent xenobiotics effect the composition and functionality of environmental microorganisms, across biomes in different geographic locations, with varying contaminating sources, categories of chemical pollutants, and their application types. Here, we investigated the impact of xenobiotics by meta-genomic analysis of 16S rRNA from seawater, soil, sludge and sediment, for deciphering microbial diversity, community structure, functional enrichment and metabolic potentiality in relation to the application of pesticide (metaldehyde), herbicide (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; DCPAA), insecticide (chlordecone) and flame retar-dant additives (organophosphate triesters; OPT and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate; TCEP). Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum consisting of Clostridia, in association with DCPAA (Lutispora sp.), metaldehyde and TCEP treatments.

Different sampling events, WWTPs across the world, different treatment technologies, configurations, and processes, as well as different PFAS classes and compounds were considered. This study evaluated 13 PFAS analyzed predominantly in 161 WWTPs across the world. The statistical test results revealed that these 13 frequently detected and reported PFAS can be divided into four groups based on their behavior during wastewater treatment, namely (1) C6-10 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), (2) C4,5,11,12 PFCAs, (3) C4,6,8 perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and (4) C10 PFSA. In this study, biological treatments such as (1) membrane bioreactors, (2) combination of two or more biological treatments, and (3) biofilm processes revealed the highest PFAS removals, although the addition of a tertiary treatment actually had a nonbeneficial effect on PFAS removal.

The results confirmed that m/z 251 was the only precursor ion of dicofol after in-source fragmentation, and m/z 139 and m/z 111 were reasonable product ions. The main factors triggering the in-source fragmentation were the H+ content and solution conductivity when dicofol entered the mass spectrometer.

Although PFAS generally exert a low toxicity on plants at environmentally relevant concentrations, they frequently impact biomass growth and photosynthetic activity at higher levels. Uptake, translocation, and toxicity of PFAS in plants have been well covered in literature. Although less attention has been given to the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant response to PFAS, recent studies based on -omics approaches indicate that PFAS affects the plant metabolism even a low concentration. The objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about the effects of PFAS on plants at the molecular level.

The presence of PFAS in ground and surface water can create a route for PFAS to enter the soil, exposing ecosystems (including agroecosystems), where they will move through the food web via biomagnification. The toxicity of PFAS to plants, particularly in agricultural ecosystems, is of emerging concern due to the application of biosolids that are often contaminated with PFAS. Nevertheless, due to the low concentrations of PFAS in most agricultural soils, the direct impact of PFAS on plant health is not well understood. We used H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to explore the effects of exposure of two key PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism. We found that Arabidopsis exhibited an accumulation of multiple metabolites, including soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose), multiple amino acids, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, suggesting that PFAS exposure impacts the metabolism of plants by causing an accumulation of stress-related amino acids and soluble sugars that drives increased activity of the TCA cycle.

Pesticide toxicity and bioaccumulation have brought up environmental issues, underlining the necessity for efficient removal techniques based on novel nanomaterials. Herein, biochar (BC) synthesized by using waste peels of citrus limetta embedded with green synthesized Fe2O3 nanoparticle by using green tea extract. By using PXRD analysis, the alpha phase of Fe2O3 confirmed. Endosulfan (ES) and Ethion (ET) pesticides are degraded photocatalytically using a sequential, BC@ Fe2O3 nanohybrid. At the pollutant concentration (50 mg L-1), with catalytic dose (25 mg) in acidic condition under natural sunlight, BC@ Fe2O3 showed to be extremely effective in the breakdown of pesticides. The higher removal of pesticides by BC@ Fe2O3 supported by higher value of zeta potential (-22.5 mV), enhanced surface area (74 m(2) g(-1)) and lower value of band gap (1.8 eV) as an effect of interactive characteristic and semiconducting behaviour. The fast decline in pesticide concentration followed by a gradual decrease demonstrated I-st order kinetics triggered by Langmuir adsorption.

In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about PFAS in the environment, since they are difficult to break down through natural processes, are highly persistent in humans, animals, soils and waters, and can travel long distances in surface and groundwater. This has created an increased need for PFAS analysis. Most PFAS monitoring currently takes place using field sampling and chromatographic analytical methods, which are laboratory-based and are very costly when used to monitor PFAS in the environment. Using a semi-systematic literature review approach, a comparative study is conducted in this article on the available analytical methods and sensor technologies that can be used to monitor and detect PFAS in the environment, including chromatographic, instrumentation analysis, and sensor-based methods. This study considered four critical factors for effective and efficient monitoring methods, which include the type of PFAS detected, removing background levels, determining detection limits, and identifying samples. In general, other analytical instruments are used in conjunction with chromatographic techniques for detecting both target and non-target analytes at a lower level of detection (LOD). It is shown that even though some sensor types have a low LOD, they are only useful for detecting targeted PFAS in water samples. However, sensors are an emerging technology that could be developed to enable low-cost, portable methods for the remote detection of PFAS species on-site.",,10.3390/w15203577,,NA,,a review of analytical methods and technologies for monitoring per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in water

PFAAs are widely detected in soils from many countries worldwide and their distribution is related to the emission of the fluorine-containing organic industry. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are found to be the predominant PFAAs in soil. Industrial emission is the main source of PFAAs contributing 49.9\% of the total concentrations of PFAAs (Ʃ PFAAs) in soil, followed by activated sludge treated by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (19.9\%) and irrigation of effluents from WWTPs, usage of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFFs) and leaching of leachate from landfill (30.2\%).

Many are highly toxic and accumulate both in soil and in organisms. Their biological transformation takes place by dehalogenation, in which the halogen substituents are detached from the carbon in the organic compound by enzymes produced by microorganisms. This increases the compounds' water solubility and bioavailability, reduces toxicity, and allows the resulting compound to become more susceptible to biodegradation. The microbial halogen cycle in soil is an important part of global dehalogenation processes. The aim of the study was to examine the potential of microbial communities inhabiting natural and anthropogenically modified environments to carry out the dehalogenation process. The potential of microorganisms was assessed by analyzing the metagenomes from a natural environment (forest soils) and from environments subjected to anthropopression (agricultural soil and sludge from wastewater treatment plants). Thirteen genes encoding enzymes with dehalogenase activity were identified in the metagenomes of both environments, among which, 2-haloacid dehalogenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase were the most abundant genes. Comparative analysis, based on comparing taxonomy, identified genes, total halogens content and content of DDT derivatives, demonstrated the ability of microorganisms to transform HOCs in both environments, indicating the presence of these compounds in the environment for a long period of time and the adaptive need to develop mechanisms for their detoxification.

Many stakeholders, including regulators, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and concerned individuals could benefit from an efficient way to access the health and toxicological literature related to PFAS. Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of the available peer-reviewed health or toxicological research for 29 PFAS. Methods: A protocol for conducting this systematic evidence map was initially published on Zenodo (Pelch et al. 2019c), then peer reviewed and published in Environment International (Pelch et al. 2019d) PubMed database was searched through January 25, 2021. Studies were screened for inclusion and exclusion according to the Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad and included any human, animal, and/or in vitro study that investigated exposure to one of the 29 PFAS of interest and a human health or toxicological effect. Selected study details were extracted from included studies as described in the protocol. Study appraisal was not conducted. The included studies and extracted meta-data are freely available in the online, interactive systematic evidence map at https://pfastoxdatabase.org. Results: Over 15,000 studies were retrieved from the PubMed literature searches.

An over-reliance on their application to crops to control pests can disturb ecosystems. Therefore, the scientific community and policymakers must be aware of the commitment and active stance they need to take up to effectively elaborate on solutions toward mitigating environmental contamination over the coming few years. We, therefore, reviewed the academic literature on bioremediation from 2018 to 2021 (the latest year of complete publication) to provide a meta-analysis of microbial systems capable of dissipating pesticides from agricultural soils. Natural attenuation can control lindane; however, it is time-consuming and unconvincing to scale. By introducing a suite of microorganisms into the system for substrate-specific biodegradation, we can boost the bioprocess and ultimately level up its cost-effectiveness. Options of microorganisms for bioaugmentation include the fungus Trametes versicolor and the bacteria Pigmentiphaga spp. and Paenanthrobacter spp. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation are enablers of environmental reclamation in agroecosystems. However, those biocatalytic strategies can be costly while manifesting as degraders to ecological sustainability. For instance, allochthonous and recombinant microorganisms can reduce genetic diversity by promoting antagonistic relationships. In addition, some stimulant minerals can be more toxic and harmful to beneficial non-target organisms than the target pesticide. Prudence and safety are significant aspects of ensuring environmentally safer applications for pesticide-degrading approaches. Therefore, our analytical insights can provide knowledge to progress the field's prominence in developing high-throughput microbiological removal of hazardous active compounds from agricultural soils.",,10.1007/s11157-022-09637-w,Pesticides,NA,,microbial bioremediation of pesticides in agricultural soils an integrative review on natural attenuation bioaugmentation and biostimulation

However, evidence from current researches is limited and inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the potential associations comprehensively. We systematically and extensively searched two electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) from inception to July 3, 2022 and an updated search was performed before submission. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from stratified random-effects meta-analyses by type of exposure and outcome. We also tested the potential heterogeneity across studies, conducted sensitivity analysis and evaluated publication bias. A total of 20 studies were finally included in our study. Meta-analytical effect estimates indicated a positive association between prenatal exposure to PCB138, PCB-153 and PCB-170 and an increased risk of ASD, with OR of 1.89 (95\% CI = 1.21-2.95, I2 = 0\%), 1.61 (95\% CI = 1.05-2.47, I2 = 0\%) and 1.46 (95\% CI = 1.03-2.06, I2 = 0\%) respectively. In contrast, PFDA was found inversely associated with the risk of ASD (OR = 0.70, 95\% CI = 0.52-0.94, I2 = 0\%). The level of evidence supporting a link between ASD risk and exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153, PCB-170, and PFDA was respectively categorized as low, low, moderate, and low. In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-170 correlates with a heightened risk of ASD, with evidence levels rated as ``low{''}, ``low{''}, and ``moderate{''}, respectively. In contrast, PFDA exposure appears to be inversely associated with ASD risk, with a ``low{''} level of supporting evidence.

Exposure to PFOS may alter gut microbiota and liver metabolic homeostasis in tammals, thereby increasing the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Diets high in soluble fibers can ameliorate metabolic disease risks. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the hypothesis that soluble fibers (inulin or pectin) could modulate he adverse metabolic effects of PFOS by affecting microbe-liver metabolism and interactions. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed an isocaloric diet containing different fibers: a) inulin (soluble), h) pectin (soluble), or c) cellulose (control, insoluble). The mice were exposed to PFOS in drinking water (3 ttgig per day) for 7 wk. Multi-omics was used to analyze mouse liver and cecum contents. RESULTS: In PFOS-exposed mice, the number of differentially expressed genes associated with atherogenesis and hepatic hyperlipidemia were lower in those that were fed soluble fiber than those fed insoluble fiber. Shotgun metagenomics showed that inulin and pectin protected against differences in microbiome community in PFOS-exposed vs. control mice. It was found that the plasma PFOS levels were lower in inulin-fed mice, and there was a trend of lower liver accumulation of PFOS in soluble fiber-fed mice compared with the control group. Soluble fiber intake ameliorated the effects of PFOS on host hepatic metabolism gene expression and cecal content microbiome structure. DISCUSSIONS: Results from metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic studies suggest that inulin- and pectin-fed mice were less susceptible-to PFOS-induced liver metabolic disturbance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and transcriptional changes compared with control diet-fed mice. Our study advances the understanding of interaction between microbes and host under the influences of environmental pollutants and nutrients. The results provide new insights into the microbe-liver metabolic network and the protection against environmental pollutant-induced metabolic diseases by highfiber diets.",,10.1289/EHP11360,Transcriptome;Dietary Fiber;Mice,NA,,metabolomic lipidomic transcriptomic and metagenomic analyses in mice exposed to pfos and fed soluble and insoluble dietary fibers

However, few studies have considered their combined effects, which would be more representative of PFAS occurring in the environment. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a mixture of 18 PFAS at three environmentally relevant concentrations for 5 days to assess their bioconcentration and metabolic consequences. The burdens of n-ary sumation PFAS in zebrafish larvae were 0.12, 1.58, and 9.63 mg/kg in the 0.5, 5, and 50 mu g/L treatment groups, respectively. Exposure to the PFAS mixture accelerated hatching and larval heart rates, increased energy expenditure, and reduced ATP levels and glucose contents due to decreased feed intake and glucose uptake. Metabolomic analysis revealed that exposure to the PFAS mixture enhanced glycolysis but inhibited phospholipid synthesis, and significantly increased the expression of lipid metabolism related genes (srebf1, acox, and ppar alpha), which indicated enhanced beta-oxidation. The significant changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial content, and the transcription of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (mfn2, ndufs1, atp5fa1, and mt-nd1) and mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription (18rs-rrn, and polg1) suggested that exposure to the PFAS mixture could cause mitochondrial dysfunction and further disrupt glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, ultimately causing metabolic disorders in zebrafish larvae.

The abundance of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites was decreased in PFOAtreated cells except for succinate, whereas most of amino acids were more abundant. Beside serine and glycine, the levels of metabolites derived from 13C glucose were reduced in PFOA-treated cells, and the pentose phosphate pathway flux was 1.4-fold higher in PFOA-treated cells than in the controls. In reductive glutamine pathway, higher labeled enrichment of citrate, malate, fumarate, and succinate was observed for PFOA-treated cells. The contribution of glucose to fatty acid synthesis in PFOA-treated cells decreased while the contribution of glutamine to fatty acid synthesis increased. Additionally, synthesis of TCA intermediates from fatty acid beta-oxidation was promoted in PFOA-treated cells.

L. and Beestrum, Molly and Brown, Oluwateniola and Cichowski, Sara",,,,,"Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), such as pelvic organ prolapse (POP), anal incontinence (AI), and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs), affect approximately 1 in 4 women in the United States. Many women endure PFD symptoms without seeking care. The Andersen's health behavior model explains health service utilization (HSU) using 4 domains: (1) individual needs for care, (2) resources or enabling factors, (3) predisposing factors, and (4) macrostructural/contextual factors. This study aims to apply this model to PFDs to determine the rate of HSUs in American women experiencing PFDs. The secondary objective was to examine HSU behavior using a variation of Andersen's model: the authors limited outcome variables to that of accessing PFD health services by any health care provider. As the normal Andersen's health behavior model covers broad personal health practices and general health behavior, this modification allowed for increased precision of individual predictors and relevance to urogynecology. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, the authors conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed, using search terms relevant to PFDs (in addition to disparities in care access). Included were studies of community-dwelling PFD symptomatic women living in the United States and quantitative and qualitative studies with primary and/or secondary aims addressing care-seeking or HSU behavior. For this study, PFDs were defined as AI, LUTSs, and POP. Extracted data were as follows: first author's last name, study aim, year of publication, study population geographic location, study participant demographics, PFD types, insurance, number of care-seekers and/or non-care-seekers, participant age, race/ethnicity, education, income, employment, body mass index, general health status, language used in study, symptoms, and other barriers and/or promotors identified. Overall, 44 publications were found that met the criteria of the study. Of these, 36 were quantitative, 5 were qualitative, and 3 were mixed-methods studies. The predominant focus of these studies was LUTSs (33/44 studies), whereas only 2 were on POP, 5 onmultiple PFDs, and 4 onAI. More than half were publishedmore than a decade ago (25/44), and themajority were based on self-reporting to national surveys. Women with symptomatic PFDs exhibited a 37\% pooled prevalence of HSU, with determinants identified across the first 3 domains in the model only (macrostructural domains associated with HSU were not identified). For the first domain, quantitative studies demonstrated that PFD symptom severity and duration and preexisting depression were individual care needs associated with greater HSU behavior. Consistent with the quantitative data available in this study, qualitative data also demonstrated that facilitators of HSU were (1) longer symptom duration and (2) negative impact of PFD on quality of life. For the resources domain, established primary or secondary care and social support/networks increased HSU behaviors, but (oddly) higher income and employment were barriers to care. Of note, home remedy utilization was identified as a barrier to HSU in this category (taking of herbal supplements, use of diapers, and other self-management strategies). Predisposing factors noted to increase HSU in this study were age older than 50 years. Minority women were not well represented in this analysis, but notably, Asian women were significantly less likely to demonstrate HSU related to PFD. Qualitatively, there were no differences in socioeconomic status of women who did or did not show HSU, but the most common facilitator was awareness of PFD treatments, and common barriers included misinformation and normalization of pelvic floor symptoms. Limitations of this study include the possibility of missed publications with relevance (such as articles involving interstitial cystitis, sexual dysfunction, birth trauma, and others, as they are important aspects of PFDs). However, the team focused on studies related to common PFDs and their HSU, as opposed to peripheral analyses or pelvic floor conditions. Second, the study may be limited by using counts of themes and numbers of reporting studies in the overall qualitative analysis. Finally, significant heterogeneity in the studies indicates caution should be used in interpreting the operating room and pooled HSU rate for each identified determinant. The study indicates that designing inclusive interventions, building upon previous research frameworks, and addressing multilayered factors are all required for improving care-seeking rates of women with PFDs. To mitigate the glaring inequity in the United States of access to pelvic floor care, the authors recommend research focused on HSU for patients with POP or AI, implementation of multifaceted interventions, and investigations into macrostructural factors affecting HSU.",,10.1097/OGX.0000000000001115,United States;Pelvic Floor;Health Services,NA,,barriers and promotors to health service utilization for pelvic floor disorders in the united states systematic review and metaanalysis of qualitative and quantitative studies

Therefore, understanding the metabolic changes caused by PFOA exposure is of great significance to protect pregnant women from its adverse effects. In this study, the metabolomes from the urine samples of pregnant women exposure to PFOA at different degrees were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. The samples in different groups were distinguished and the differential metabolites were screened based on the VIP value, FC, and P-value of each comparison group through multivariate statistical analysis. The pathways related to differential metabolites were searched to reveal the effects of PFOA exposure on metabolic changes in pregnant women at different degrees. Finally, the ROC of differential metabolites was performed, and the differential metabolites with large area under the curve (AUC) values were selected and compared to identify the mutually differential metabolites. Meanwhile, these metabolites were fitted with a multivariable to explore if they could be used to distinguish different groups. The quantitative comparison of mutually differential metabolites revealed that the levels of L-cysteine, glycine, and 5-aminovaleric acid were positively correlated with the degree of PFOA exposure, indicating that different degrees of PFOA exposure could affect the synthesis or degradation of GSH and change the metabolism of oral or intestinal microbiota. Additionally, they may cause oxidative stress and abnormal fat metabolism in pregnant women.

Thus we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodsRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies comparing InterTAN with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), the Asian PFNA (PFNA-II), or the Gamma3 nail in treating IFF were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from inception to April 30, 2023. The differences in perioperative parameters and clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated by mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI). The risks of various complications and mortality were assessed by risk ratio (RR) with 95\%CI.ResultsTwenty-three studies comprising 3566 patients were included. Compared with single-screw cephalomedullary nails (PFNA/PFNA-II, Gamma3), InterTAN conferred significantly reduced risk of implant failures (RR = 0.37, 95\%CI 0.26 to 0.51, P < 0.001), hip and thigh pain (RR = 0.70, 95\%CI 0.55 to 0.90, P = 0.006) and all-cause revision/reoperation (RR = 0.38, 95\%CI 0.26 to 0.57, P < 0.001). Moreover, patients treated with InterTAN had significantly higher 1-year Harris Hip Score (MD = 0.82, 95\%CI 0.20-1.44, P = 0.010) and shorter time to union/healing (MD = - 0.66 days, 95\%CI - 1.16 to - 0.16, P = 0.009). Femoral neck shortening, time to full bearing, and incidences of non-union, infection, deep venous thrombosis, and mortality were comparable between both groups.ConclusionsThe integrated dual-screw InterTAN construct has superior performance in reducing risks of complications and improving clinical and functional outcomes in the treatment of IFF.

In the early 2020s, the need for personal protection due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased consumption of plastic materials (e.g., facemasks and gloves) and ultimately to increased plastic pollution, especially by PMFs. The PMFs present in the environment may be released in this form (primary particles) or in larger materials, that will release them as a result of environmental conditions. Although a considerable number of studies have been addressing the effects of microplastics, most of them studied round particles, with fewer studies focusing on PMFs. Thus, the current study aimed to summarize and critically discuss the available data concerning the ecotoxicological impact of PMFs on aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms exposed to PMFs showed accumulation, mainly in the digestive tract, and several toxic effects, such as DNA damage, physiological alterations, digestive damage and even mortality, suggesting that PMFs can pose a risk for the health of aquatic organisms. The PMFs induced toxicity to aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate organisms depends on size, shape, chemical association and composition of fibers.

Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are capable of removing PFASs from water through adsorption techniques. However, there is still constructive discussion on the potential of MOFs in adsorbing and removing PFASs for large-scale engineering applications. This review systematically investigates the use of MOFs as adsorbents for the removal of PFAS in water treatment. This primarily involved a comprehensive analysis of existing literature to understand the adsorption mechanisms of MOFs and to identify factors that enhance their efficiency in removing PFASs. We also explore the critical aspects of regeneration and stability of MOFs, assessing their reusability and long-term performance, which are essential for large-scale water treatment applications. Finally, our study highlights the challenges of removing PFASs using MOFs. Especially, the efficient removal of short-chain PFASs with hydrophilicity is a major challenge, while medium- to long-chain PFASs are frequently susceptible to being captured from water by MOFs through multiple synergistic effects. The ion-exchange force may be the key to solving this difficulty, but its susceptibility to ion interference in water needs to be addressed in practical applications. We hope that this review can provide valuable insights into the effective removal and adsorption mechanisms of PFASs as well as advance the sustainable utilization of MOFs in the field of water treatment, thereby presenting a novel perspective.",,10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c02939,Adsorption,NA,,metalorganic frameworkbased composites for the adsorption removal of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances from water

Fold change analysis of the metabolome revealed the effect of DDT on bile acid biosynthesis. Gene expression of the related enzyme in rat liver samples was also quantified. Significant association was found between DDT and gene expression levels related to constitutive androstane receptor mediated enzymes, such as Cyp2b1 in rat livers. However, our results could not fully demonstrate that enzymes related to bile acid biosynthesis were strongly affected by DDT. The correlation between DDT concentration and gene expression involved in steroid hormone synthesis in testis was also evaluated; however, no significant correlation was found. The disturbance of metabolic enzymes occurred in rat liver in the target area. Our results suggest that DDT exposure affects gene expression in wild rats living in DDT-sprayed areas.

The objective of this research was to examine the alterations in liver transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in offspring rats at postnatal day (PND) 30 following gestational and lactational exposure to PFOS (from gestational day 1 to 20 and PND 1 to 21). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into a control group (3\% starch gel solution, oral gavage) and a PFOS exposure group (0.03 mg/kg body weight per day, oral gavage). Histopathological changes in liver sections were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical analysis was conducted to evaluate changes in glucose and lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were utilized to identify significant genes and metabolites associated with alterations of liver glucose and lipid metabolism through an integrated multi-omics analysis. No significant differences were found in the measured biochemical parameters. In total, 167 significant differ-entially expressed genes (DEGs) related to processes such as steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and fat digestion and absorption were identified in offspring rats in the PFOS exposure group. Ninety-five altered metabolites were exhibited in the PFOS exposure group, such as heptaethylene glycol, lysoPE (0:0/18:0), lucidenic acid K, and p-Cresol sulfate.

Michael and Christensen, Krista and Lin, Cynthia J. and Goldstone, Alex and ra E. and Lemeris, Courtney and Thayer, Kristina A.",,,,,"BACKGROUND: Per- and polylluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a large class of chemicals with widespread use and persistence in the environment and in humans; however, most of the epidemiology research has focused on a small subset. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n =37), endocrine (n =30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n=27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n=14), cancer (n=12), and urinary (n =11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62\%) studies were considered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PEAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PEAS may be used as replacements for ``legacy{''} PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SENT highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist.",,10.1289/EHP11185,,NA,,epidemiology evidence for health effects of 150 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances a systematic evidence map

V. and de Noronha, M.",,,,,"Objective: This systematic review investigated whether people with patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) have muscle strength, volume, and activation around the hip and knee that is different from asymptomatic controls. Methods: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation. Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least two studies reporting the same domain. Results: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95\%CI = -1.34 to -0.57), hip external rotation (-0.55;-1.07 to -0.03), hip extension (-0.72;-1.16 to -0.28), and knee extension (-0.97;-1.41 to -0.53) when compared to asymptomatic controls.

Improving the proprioception of PFMs, defined as the capacity to know the status and position of each body part, and adequately contracting them could be a protective factor to prevent the appearance of PFDs in the general female population. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of educational interventions and verbal instructions on how to contract and exercise the PFMs to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women. A systematic search of studies published in the last 20 years until March 2022 was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, Lilacs, and Dialnet databases. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity in the types of studies and included populations. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for the design, search, and reporting of studies. The methodological quality was analysed via the PEDro and the Newcastle-Ottawa scales in the case of randomised clinical trials and non-randomised studies, respectively, while the quality of evidence was determined using the SIGN grading system for evidence-based guidelines. Descriptive and experimental studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that evaluated the contractile capability of the PFMs in healthy women or women without a previous diagnosis of PFD were included. Seven articles that included a total of 2507 women were found, three of which were clinical trials with PEDro scores between 5 and 9 points out of 10 and four of which were non-randomised studies with NOS scores between 6 and 8 points out of 10. The outcomes were measured through vaginal palpation, visual observation, questionnaires for PFD symptoms, and self-perception reports. This review discriminated between two types of intervention, educational programmes and verbal instructions, and evaluated the changes observed in PFM strength and knowledgeability and the symptoms of PFDs. The findings showed that educational interventions and verbal instructions improve the proprioception of PFMs in women of all ages that are healthy or without a previous diagnosis of PFDs as well as their knowledge about the pelvic floor, healthy lifestyle habits, and symptoms that are potentially indicative of PFDs.

After exposure to mPFASs, the silkworm midgut was enriched with high levels of PFASs, which induced histopathological changes. The composition of the midgut microbiota was significantly affected by mPFAS exposure, and functional predictions revealed significant disruption of some metabolic pathways. RNA-seq analysis revealed that mPFASs significantly changed the transcription profiles. Functional enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes also revealed that biological processes related to metabolic pathways and the digestive system were significantly affected, similar to the results of the gut microbiota analysis, suggesting that mPFAS exposure had an adverse effect on the metabolic function of silkworms and may further affect their normal growth. Finally, the significant correlation between abundance changes in the gut microbiota and metabolism/digestion-related genes further highlighted the role of the gut microbiota in mPFAS-related processes affecting the metabolic functions of silkworms.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the impact of ED on PCa and the role of proteins in this process are not yet well understood. Here, two complementary computational approaches have been employed to investigate the molecular processes underlying the acquisition of malignancy in prostate cancer. First, the metabolic reprogramming associated with the chronic exposure to Aldrin in DU145 cells was studied by integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics via constraint-based metabolic modeling. Second, gene set enrichment analysis was applied to determine (i) altered regulatory pathways and (ii) the correlation between changes in the transcriptomic profile of Aldrin-exposed cells and tumor progression in various types of cancer.

Exposure of omega-6 fatty acids to an oxidative environment results in the generation of a highly reactive carbonyl species known as trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). The timely and efficient detoxification of this metabolite, which has actions comparable to other reactive carbonyl species, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and methylglyoxal, is essential for disease prevention. However, the detoxification mechanism for tt-DDE remains elusive. In this study, the enzyme Aldh9a1b is identified as having a key role in the detoxification of tt-DDE. Loss of Aldh9a1b increased tt-DDE levels and resulted in an abnormal retinal vasculature and glucose intolerance in aldh9a1b-/- zebrafish. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that tt-DDE and aldh9a1b deficiency in larval and adult zebrafish induced insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis. Moreover, alterations in hyaloid vasculature is induced by aldh9a1b knockout or by tt-DDE treatment can be rescued by the insulin receptor sensitizers metformin and rosiglitazone. Collectively, these results demonstrated that tt-DDE is the substrate of Aldh9a1b which causes microvascular damage and impaired glucose metabolism through insulin resistance. Omega-6 fatty acids, prevalent in Western diets, are oxidized to form trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). This study reveals ALDH9a1b as a novel detoxifying system for tt-DDE, confirmed by a CRISPR KO line.

In this study, human fecal samples were used to model the microbial population of the colon, to test whether these anaerobic microbes could facilitate 8:2 monosubstituted PAP (monoPAP) transformation. In vitro testing was completed by incubating the fecal samples with 8:2 monoPAP (400-10,000 nM) up to 120 minutes in an anaerobic chamber. Reactions were then terminated and the samples prepared for GC- and LC-MS/MS analysis.

The gut microbiome also produced a unique composition of oxidative metabolites, where the following intermediate metabolites were more abundant than terminal PFCAs: 8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA) > 8:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA) > 7:2 Ketone approximate to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Hydrolytic and oxidative metabolites contributed up to 30\% of the molar balance after microbial 8:2 monoPAP transformation. Together, the results suggest that the gut microbiome can play a notable role in PAP biotransformation.",,10.1039/d2em00225f,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Biotransformation;Surface-Active Agents,NA,,the human fecal microbiome contributes to the biotransformation of the pfas surfactant 82 monosubstituted polyfluoroalkyl phosphate ester

Outcomes reviewed included age; gender; indications; pathology; functional evaluations; surgical outcomes and complications.Results Fifteen papers met our inclusion criteria, accounting for 394 patients. Endoscopic or robotic FTS was carried out for benign and malignant thyroid lesions, with or without central neck dissection. Nodule size and thyroid lobe volume did not exceed 6, 10 cm, respectively. FTS reported comparable outcome with transaxillary or oral approaches about operative time, complication rates or drainage features. The mean operative time ranged from 88 to 220 min, depending on the type of surgery (endoscopic vs robotic hemi- or total thyroidectomy). Conversion to open surgery was rare, occurring in 0-6.3\% of cases. The most common complications were earlobe hypoesthesia, hematoma, seroma, transient hypocalcemia and transient recurrent nerve palsy.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to decipher the precise relationship between SSS and AF, further exploring and comparing different therapy strategies on the occurrence or progression of AF in patients with SSS. Methods and results: A systematic literature search was conducted until November 2022. A total of 35 articles with 37,550 patients were included. Patients with SSS were associated with new-onset AF compared to those without SSS. Catheter ablation was associated with a lower risk of AF recurrence, AF progression, all-cause mortality, stroke and hospitalization of heart failure compared to pacemaker therapy. Regarding the different pacing strategies for SSS, VVI/VVIR has higher risk of new-onset AF than DDD/DDDR. No significant difference was found between AAI/AAIR and DDD/DDDR, as well as between DDD/DDDR and minimal ventricular pacing (MVP) for AF recurrence. AAI/AAIR was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality when compared to DDD/DDDR, but lower risk of cardiac death when compared to DDD/DDDR. Right atrial septum pacing was associated with a similar risk of new-onset AF or AF recurrence compared to right atrial appendage pacing. Conclusion: SSS is associated with a higher risk of AF. For patients with both SSS and AF, catheter ablation should be considered. This meta-analysis re-emphasizes that high percentage of ventricular pacing should be avoided in patients with SSS in order to decrease AF burden and mortality.",,10.1016/j.ijcard.2023.03.066,Atrial Fibrillation;Sick Sinus Syndrome,NA,,association between sick sinus syndrome and atrial fibrillation a systematic review and metaanalysis

Additionally, data regarding prevalence of lumbar disc degeneration and back pain in competitive swimmers were synthesized.SynthesisFour studies were included in the final analysis. Study quality and risk of bias were deemed adequate. There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 0.74) regarding data collected, population of swimmers, sample size, and methods. Therefore, a meta-analysis was not conducted. The majority of the studies included in this study (three of four) reported that swimmers have increased odds of developing lumbar DDD. Additionally, secondary outcome analysis indicated that swimmers have a higher probability of developing moderate-to-severe back pain.ConclusionCompetitive swimming appears to be associated with the presence of DDD on advanced imaging and moderate-to-severe back pain. These findings are limited by significant differences in study methodology in the included studies. Although swimming is conventionally considered a low-impact sport, elite swimmers risk developing lower back pain and disc pathology, possibly because training involves unique biomechanics with repetitive rotational and hyperextension/flexion of the spine. Further research investigating risk factors involving biomechanics of swimming on the spine may have important implications for stroke technique, injury prevention, and rehabilitation for swimmers.",,10.1002/pmrj.13138,Risk Assessment,NA,,assessing the risk of lumbar degenerative disc disease associated with swimming a systematic review

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrornbasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet alpha llb beta 3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (a delta SPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatrnent of the under lying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies. Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and a delta SPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed.

However, their gastrointestinal biology (lack of stomach) has limited their acid-peptic digestion, acid lysis of plants and invertebrate tissues, and phosphorus uptake. This review presents data from 118 articles on the use of plant-based feed additives (PFAs) in Cyprinus carpio (common carp). Our review shows that most PFA research in carp is focused on improving feed and nutrient utilization efficiency along various levels (in vivo digestibility, metabolizability to in situ nutrient loading), while other half is focused on ensuring animal welfare standards (biomass, immunity, welfare). Several reviewed plant-based additives however tend to do both. The PFAs include essential oils (EOs), plant-part extracts (PPEs), medicinal plants (herbs) and spices. The effective inclusion rate of EOs is lower (0.5\%-0.75\%). Whereas PPEs, herbs and spices work at a generic inclusion rate of 2\%-5\% in carp feeds. Even at an optimum inclusion rate, there are factors controlling PFAs efficacy such as methods of preparation (reviewed). PFAs like lemon beebrush, geranium, dill, Rosemary pepper and common mallow with/without certain pre-conditions are better to avoid in cyprinid diets. Although certain PFAs may potentially alter organoleptic qualities of carp flesh or might assist in training carp immunity, information on these aspects is limited.

Aim The purpose of this retrospective study, therefore, was to assess the peri-prosthetic fracture rate and failure rates of elderly neck of femur (NOF) fractures implanted with either a short or long proximal femoral nail (PFN). Materials and methods A retrospective study was conducted in a single orthopaedic department (University Hospital Dorset, Poole, GBR) using collected data on all extracapsular neck of femur fracture patients from the national hip fracture database (NHFD) from January 1, 2011, to December 23, 2021. The data collected included patient age, sex, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) type of neck of femur fracture, type of surgery performed, any further peri-prosthetic fractures, and time to re-operation in that subset of the group. The implants used were the Stryker Gamma 3 Nail and the Smith Nephew (Trigen and Intertan). All patients were allowed to fully weight bear as tolerated and received both orthopaedic and elderly medical care. Failure was defined as a cut-out or implant fracture. Results From January 1, 2011, to December 23, 2021, there were 1010 extracapsular neck of femur fractures recorded on the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) treated with a PFN from the study centre. Of those patients, 11 had pathological fractures and were excluded. 649 patients had long PFNs, and 350 had short PFNs. Of the total of 999 patients, 254 (25\%) were male and 745 (75\%) were female. More than 80\% of the patients in the sample were over the age of 75. The majority of patients in both groups had A1/A2 fractures (short 84.3\%, long 49.1\%). The rate of periprosthetic fractures in the short PFNs was 1.71\%, and the failure rate was 0.57\%. The rate of periprosthetic fractures in the long PFNs was 0.62\%, with a failure rate of 0.92\%. The multi-nominal logistic regression model did not show statistically significant odds ratios (OR) for the following variables: long/short nails, male/female gender, age, ASA, or type of fracture. The female gender was associated with a higher risk of both periprosthetic fractures and failures (OR of 2.232 and 2.95), but this was not found to be statistically significant. Similarly, unstable A3 fractures had a much higher risk of failure (OR of 2.691) compared to periprosthetic fractures (OR of 0.985). However, this was not statistically significant. Conclusion Overall, this study has identified that in a patient population that is predominantly female and over the age of 75, the risk of periprosthetic fracture rate and the failure rate is similar in both the use of a short or a long PFN for intertrochanteric fractures.",,10.7759/cureus.32892,Cohort Studies;Nails;Hip Fractures,NA,,periprosthetic fractures in long versus short proximal femoral nailing for intertrochanteric fractures a 10year singlecentre cohort study

These chemicals are eventually taken up by aquatic organisms, where they can cause harmful effects. However, knowledge gaps related to the connections between hydrological, chemical, and biological processes currently limit our ability to forecast potential future changes in contaminant concentrations accurately. In this study, concentrations of three pesticide classes (organochlorines, organophosphates, and herbicides) and a standard suite of trace metals were analyzed in the South Saskatchewan River, Canada in 2020 and 2021 in water, sediments, and fishes. Organochlorine pesticides have been banned in Canada since the 1970s, yet there were some detections for methoxychlor and lindane, predominantly in sediment and fish samples, which could be attributed to legacy contamination. Except for malathion and parathion, organophosphate pesticides were scarcely detected in both sampling years in all matrices, and neonicotinoids were below detection in all samples. Conversely, the herbicides 2,4-D and dicamba were detected consistently throughout all locations in water samples for both sampling years. Overall, concentrations were 3 times higher in 2020 when river discharge was similar to 2 times higher, suggesting run-off from the surrounding catchment or disturbance of contaminated sediments. Analysis for trace metals revealed that Cu and Zn exceeded sediment quality guidelines in some locations. Mercury concentrations exceeded the guidelines for about 18\% of the samples (water and sediment) analyzed.

This study examined the effects of root exudates produced from dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) and monocot (Brachypodium distachyon) grown under different nutrient conditions (nutrient -rich, sulfur -free, and potassium -free) on 6:2 FTOH biotransformation with or without bioaugmentating agent Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. All the exudates enhanced defluorination of 6:2 FTOH by glucose -grown RHA1. Amendment of dicot or monocot root exudates, regardless of the plant growth conditions, also enhanced 6:2 FTOH biotransformation in soil microcosms. Interestingly, high levels of humic-like substances in the root exudates are linked to high extents of 6:2 FTOH defluorination. Bioaugmenting strain RHA1 along with root exudates facilitated 6:2 FTOH transformation with a production of more diverse metabolites. Microbial community analysis revealed that Rhodococcus was predominant in all strain RHA1 spiked treatments. Different root exudates changed the soil microbiome dynamics.

Combined with the advantages of DDT for long-distance accurate crossing, ground grouting technology can achieve safe and efficient management of underground engineering disasters, and has a broad application prospect. This paper systematically reviews the development history, research status and key technologies of DDT. Firstly, the development history of DDT is introduced. Secondly, the scientific research plan, academic paper publication, relevant patent authorization, and application exploration of DDT are analysed. The analysis results show that the DDT in China has reached an internationally advanced level of technological independence and broad-range application, but there are still some core technical problems that need to be resolved, such as thousand-meter long-distance fast drilling, accurate drilling guidance in complex geological conditions, and accurate grouting in underground engineering. Focusing on the construction requirements of strategic major projects, this paper proposes four functional modules, i.e., forecasting, drilling, grouting and detecting, and analyses and discusses six aspects of ultra-long directional drilling and grouting (i.e., sensing prediction while drilling, rapid drilling and sticking prediction, precision guidance technology, remote gel controllable grouting material, pressure stabilizing and controlling sectional grouting process, and detection system with drilling).

In the present study, a sensitive and rapid high-performance thin-layer chromatography method was developed for the simultaneous determination of marmelosin, umbelliferone, and psoralen from the four different aerial parts of A. marmelos. The method uses HPTLC silica gel 60 RP-18 W plates as stationary phase, and acetonitrile: 0.1\% orthophosphoric acid in water (1:1 v/v) as solvent system. The developed method is validated for specificity, precision, repeatability, and accuracy in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Further, the estimation of heavy metal suggested that the A. marmelos bark sample was highly contaminated with cadmium (3.8 +/- 0.7 mu g/g) which was far from the permissible range as described by World Health Organization (WHO). The observed chromium concentration was higher in the bark and the fruit than the normal range recorded in the plants.

Nevertheless, these conventional techniques have several limitations, involving complicated pre-treatment steps, requiring expensive instruments, operational difficulty, lack of instrument portability, and difficulties in real-time monitoring. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is one of the current leading techniques widely applied for the ultrasensitive detection of pesticides molecules. SERS takes advantage to combine the high specificity of Raman scattering with the signal amplification of electromagnetic enhancement provided by the excitation of surface Plasmon resonances in metallic nanostructures, together with the charge transfer mechanisms established between metal surfaces and analytes. In this brief review, types of classification of pesticides that can be classed have been reported. These classifications can provide valuable information on the chemistry of pesticides.

However, its utilisation is hampered by the presence of micropollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Previous studies indicate that the type and amount of micropollutants can be significantly adjusted by selecting the right process parameters. This literature review provides an overview of how (1) pyrolysis temperature, (2) carrier gas flow and type, (3) heating rate, and (4) residence time affect the concentration of micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge. The micropollutants targeted are those listed by the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and by the International Biochar Institution (IBI), including PAHs, PCDD/Fs, PCBs and VOCs. In addition, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are also considered due to their presence in sewage sludge. The findings suggest that higher pyrolysis temperatures reduce micropollutant levels. Moreover, the injection of a carrier gas (N2 or CO2) during the pyrolysis and cooling processes effectively lowers PAHs and PCDD/Fs, by reducing the contact of biochar with oxygen, which is crucial in mitigating micropollutants. Nevertheless, limited available data impedes an assessment of the impact of these parameters on PFAS in biochar. In addition, further research is essential to understand the effects of carrier gas type, heating rate, and residence time in order to determine the optimal pyrolysis process parameters for generating clean biochar.",,10.1016/j.wasman.2023.12.036,"Conditioning, Operant",NA,,micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge a systematic review on the impact of pyrolysis operating conditions

For this, graphene materials have grown in interest due to their unique and appreciable characteristics. Thus, this study aims to perform a systematic review of previous studies which evaluated the use of graphene materials as support means for cobalt FTS catalysts. Twelve studies from the last five years were selected for extraction and analysis of results. The main parameters that influenced the catalytic activity of FTS catalysts were discussed, such as the type of support used, the chosen preparation method, and the graphene functionalization method. The results showed that the catalysts synthesized from different types of graphene support obtained CO conversion rates between 20 and 86.9\% and high selectivity for C5 + compounds in the gasoline range. Furthermore, the functionalization of graphene with functional groups and pretreatment with nitric acid was essential to adjust the metal-support interaction and ensure catalytic efficiency.

The traditional preferred surgical approach for pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is vaginal hysterectomy (VH) with or without pelvic floor repair. Uterine pathology treatments via hysterectomy for women, including premalignant conditions and fibroids, typically opt for the VH route. A shorter recovery time and faster return to daily activities have been associated with VH, as this procedure leaves no large abdominal incision (which may produce further wound-related complications and higher levels of pain during the recovery process). A proposed preemptive anesthetic modality aimed at minimizing postoperative pain (as well as narcotic and opioid consumption) is the application of infiltration of local anesthetics during pelvic floor reconstructive surgeries. This study aimed to evaluate infiltration of local anesthetics and their impact on perioperative outcomes for women, as well as postoperative pain for patients undergoing VH for the surgical management of PFDs. Abstract selection took place via 3 authors (A.P., A.D., and D.Z.), who used the following meta-analysis inclusion criteria: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing outcomes of patients undergoing VH due to PFDs and/or other benign indications (ie, fibroids, uterine bleeding, precancerous conditions) and received either intraoperative infiltration with local analgesic or not. Comparator groups consisted of VH-eligible patients who received placebo injections of normal saline solution in place of local anesthetic. Main outcomes of the study were postoperative pain scores and opioid use. Excluded studies were any case reports, nonrandomized trials, or animal studies. The databases searched for articles published up to January 2022 included MEDLINE (1966-2022), Scopus (2004-2022), Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Authors retrieved the full text of those studies deemed to meet the criteria. Overall, 5 RCTs were included in the analysis. Their data included 277 women who underwent a VH, with the local analgesia (LA) group patients, or those receiving preemptive local infiltration analgesia, consisting of 139 patients, whereas the control group (patients in the non-LA group who received no preemptive LA) included 138 patients. The main analgesic regimen was 0.5\% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine followed by 0.5\% ropivacaine. Total anesthetic injection amounts ranged from 20 to 50 mL from study to study. In addition, injection sites exhibited variation, but the uterosacral ligaments were the most prevalent sites of local analgesic injection. Also, opioid-based consumption up to 24 hours postoperatively was significantly reduced in the LA group when compared with the non-LA group (197 patients). Overall, the average postoperative scores at both 30 minutes to 2 hours and 3 to 6 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the LA group when compared with the non-LA group. Despite this, the postoperative pain scores later up to 24 hours postoperatively did not differ between groups. A major strength of the study was the authors' choice to set aside data restrictions to eliminate data losses. This study is the first to present outcomes from existing RCTs of local infiltration analgesia use before surgical incision during VH. Limitations of the study include a limited number of existing studies from which data were pulled, thereby hindering the ability to draw safe conclusions. The relatively small level of evidence could hinder accurate summaries of local anesthetic effects, with the possibility of overestimation/underestimation on the identified effects. The authors included some studies that were not yet published at the time of review. An additional weakness was the variation of the methodological quality of recruited studies due to design differences, included populations, and methodology. Significant heterogeneity was detected in areas such as analgesic regimens utilized, injected dosage, injection locations, and indication for surgery. Preemptive application of LA in patients undergoing VH for PFDs appears as a safe and beneficial use of anesthetic in terms of hospital stay, opioid use, and short-term postoperative pain. However, additional studies would be required to identify dosages, the optimal anesthetic regimen, and application sites to achieve the peak postoperative benefit.",,10.1097/OGX.0000000000001118,"Anesthetics, Local;Hysterectomy, Vaginal;Hysterectomy",NA,,preemptive infiltration of local anesthetics during vaginal hysterectomy a systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials

We found that, despite an increasing trend in the number of published studies, the geographical coverage is still very limited and most of the studies focused solely on trace elements (70.8\%). Among sharks, Rhincodon typus was the most represented species (66.7\%), while Mobula mobular the most studied ray species (41.7\%). Comparing the levels of pollutants in filter feeders between ocean basins, this review highlighted that Hg, As and Cd levels are mostly higher in those areas affected by both strong natural and anthropogenic source of emissions, such as the Indian Ocean.

The objective of the present study was to characterize the metabolic profiles underpinning the associations between POPs and endometriosis risk. Methodology: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in France to recruit women with and without surgically confirmed deep endometriosis. Women's serum was analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to high -resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to measure the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) and per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). A comprehensive metabolomic profiling was conducted using targeted HRMS and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) to cover polar and non -polar fractions. A ``meet -in -the -middle{''} statistical framework was applied to identify the metabolites related to endometriosis and POP levels, using multivariate linear and logistic regressions adjusting for confounding variables. Results: Fourteen PCBs, six OCPs and six PFAS were widely found in almost all serum samples. The pesticide trans-nonachlor was the POP most strongly and positively associated with deep endometriosis risk, with odds ratio (95 \% confidence interval) of 2.42 (1.49; 4.12), followed by PCB180 and 167. Women with endometriosis exhibited a distinctive metabolic profile, with elevated serum levels of lactate, ketone bodies and multiple amino acids and lower levels of bile acids, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), cortisol and hippuric acid. The metabolite 2hydroxybutyrate was simultaneously associated to endometriosis risk and exposure to trans-nonachlor. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive metabolome-wide association study of endometriosis, integrating ultra -trace profiling of POPs.

In this study, embryos and adult zebrafish were exposed to PCP to determine its potential neurotoxic mechanism and protective indicators. The survival rate, heart rate, mobility time, active status and moving distance were significantly decreased in larvae after 30 mu g/L PCP exposure. Likewise, the mobile time, latency to the first movement, velocity and moving distance of adult zebrafish were significantly reduced by PCP exposure. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of larvae revealed that arginine and proline metabolism was the primary pathway affected by PCP exposure, reflected by increased proline and decreased citrulline (CIT) contents, which were confirmed by quantitative data. PCP exposure suppressed the conversion from arginine to CIT in larvae by downregulating the expression of nos1 and nos2a. Ornithine content was increased in the brains and intestines of adult zebrafish after PCP exposure, which inhibited ornithine catabolism to CIT by downregulating otc, resulting in reduced CIT. Intriguingly, CIT supplementation significantly restored the neurobehavioral defects induced by PCP in larvae and adult zebrafish. CIT supplementation upregulated the expression of ef1 alpha and tuba1 in larvae and inhibited the downregulation of ef1 alpha in the brains of adult zebrafish.

This has led to the development of new analytical and multi-class analysis methods for the assessment of a broad range of organic pollutants in various population groups, ranging from small-scale studies to advanced studies with a large number of participants based on different exposure settings. This meta-analysis summarizes the existing literature on the assessment of organic pollutants in hair in terms of residue levels, the correlation of hair residue levels with those of other biological matrices and socio-demographic factors, the reliability of hair versus other biomatrices for exposure assessment, the use of segmental hair analysis for chronic exposure evaluation and the effect of external contamination on hair residue levels. Significantly high concentrations of organic pollutants such as pesticides, flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were reported in human hair samples from different regions and under different exposure settings. Similarly, high concentrations of pesticides (from agricultural activities), flame retardants (E-waste dismantling activities), dioxins and furans were observed in various occupational settings. Moreover, significant correlations (p < 0.05) for hair and blood concentrations were observed in majority of studies featuring pesticides and flame retardants. While among sociodemographic factors, gender and age significantly affected the hair concentrations in females and children in general exposure settings, whereas adult workers in occupational settings. Furthermore, the assessment of the hair burden of persistent organic pollutants in domestic and wild animals showed high concentrations for pesticides such as HCHs and DDTs whereas the laboratory-based studies using animals demonstrated strong correlations between exposure dose, exposure duration, and measured organic pollutant levels, mainly for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, terbuthylazine, aldrin, dieldrin and pyrethroid metabolites.

Micro-plastics and nano-plastics remain major emerging pollutants and threaten the environment, ecosystem, human health, and well-being. Micro-nanoplastics (MNPs) are also exposed to humans through cosmetics, inhalation, ingestion, drinking water, dietary sources, and drug formulations. Oral uptake is the major among the different exposure routes of MNPs to humans. After entry, it gets absorbed due to its nano size (<100 nm) and easily distributed to all parts of the body through blood, affecting multiple organs, especially vital organs of the human body leading to severe diseases. It causes cancer, heart, liver, and kidney diseases, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and affects the brain. Its adsorption with protein leads to multi-layered corona formation in human blood plasma. MNPs interact with immune cells and induce pro-inflammatory mediators, inflammatory reactions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and associated cytotoxicity. MNPs suppress T lymphocyte activity which results in a lack of immune regulation leading to autoimmune diseases. Hence, it is necessary to understand the impact of MNPs exposure on humans.

However, the impacts of various bromide ion (Br-) concentrations on the phytotoxicity, uptake and fate of SAs in plant growth and physiological metabolism of plants have not been well understood. Our research demonstrated that low concentrations of Br- (0.1, 0.5 mM) promoted the uptake and degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) in wheat and attenuated the phytotoxicity of SDZ. Additionally, we proposed a degradation pathway and identified the brominated product of SDZ (SDZBr), which attenuated the dihydrofolate synthesis inhibition by SDZ. The primary mechanism was that Br-reduced the level of reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) and alleviated oxidative damage. The production of SDZBr and the high consumption of H2O2 suggest the potential generation of reactive bromine species, contributing to the degradation of the electron-rich SDZ and thus reducing its toxicity. Moreover, metabolome analysis of wheat roots indicated that low concentrations of Br- stimulated the production of indoleacetic acid under SDZ stress, promoting growth and enhancing the uptake and degradation of SDZ. Conversely, high Br- (1 mM) concentration produced a deleterious effect.

Microplastic pollution has emerged as a global concern in marine environments and a danger to animals, predators, and humans because it has been discovered in the marine environment all over the world. This review examines the quantity of MP samples around the world and their colonization by marine microorganisms, as well as the detection, features, origins, and ecological implications of paint fragments and resins in our oceans and ports. These polymers are derived from paints and the fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) matrix used in shipbuilding. Microplastics should be regarded as coming from synthetic polymers found in ship coatings.

In this study, first, the concentration and characteristics of MPs in secondary wastewater effluent, and the influential variables related to the coagulation process, for MPs removal were identified using systematic reviews of previous studies. Then, the most proper MPs characterization and coagulation variables were chosen by experts' opinions using a fuzzy Delphi method. Therefore, the experiment tested in conditions close to the full-scale wastewater treatments. Finally, in the laboratory removal of MPs by coagulation of polyamide (PA), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene (PE), < 125 and 300-600 mu m in size, was tested by a jar test applying Al-2(SO4)(3) in doses of 5 to 100 mg/L plus 15 mg/L polyacrylamide as a coagulant aid. Using R and Excel software, the results were analyzed statistically. It was concluded that the maximum and minimum removal efficiency was 74.7 and 1.39\% for small PA and large PE, respectively.

The toxicity of florfenicol (FF) and polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) on rice seedlings was investigated. FF and PS-MPs caused colloidal agglomeration, which changed the environmental behavior of FF. FF inhibited rice growth and altered antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) activities, leading to membrane lipid peroxidation; impaired photosynthetic systems, decreased photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b, and carotene), chlorophyll precursors (Proto IX, Mg-Proto IX, and Pchlide), photosynthetic and respiratory rates. The key photosynthesis related genes (PsaA, PsaB, PsbA, PsbB, PsbC, and PsbD) were significantly down-regulated.

The results show that microplastics are widespread in lake water and sediment. There are obvious geographical differences in the occurrence of microplastics. The abundance of microplastics in different lakes varies greatly. The forms are mostly fibrous and fragments, and the main polymers are polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). Previous papers have failed to comment in as much detail on the microplastic sampling techniques employed within lake systems. The sampling and analysis methods are critical to accurately evaluating contamination results. Due to the widespread presence of microplastics and the lack of uniform standards, there are various sampling methods. Trawls and grabs are most widely used in the sampling of lake water bodies and sediment, and sodium chloride and hydrogen peroxide are the most widely used media for flotation and digestion, respectively.

As most AMU in Canada is related to animal agriculture, there is a need to reduce overall AMU, which could be accomplished through surveillance of AMU in animal agriculture, including the dairy industry. The objective of this study was to quantify AMU on dairy farms across Canada. This study had two parts: a description of data collected in 2019-2020, and a meta-analysis comparing this data to previous estimates of AMU in the Canadian dairy industry. The first included a garbage can audit (GCA) on 107 farms in four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Nova Scotia) in 2020; AMU data were converted to the dose-based metrics of defined course doses (DCD) and defined daily doses (DDD). Mixed-effect linear models were fit to determine the relationship between province and use of different classes of antimicrobials. On average, for every 100 animals on the farm, 117 DCD of antimicrobials were administered per year (IQR: 55, 158). These treatments amounted to 623 DDD / 100 animal-yr (IQR: 302, 677 DDD/100 animal-years). Penicillins were the most used class of antimicrobials, followed by first-and third-generation cephalosporins. Farms in Ontario used more third-generation cephalosporins than other provinces.

Current studies mainly focused on the individual effects of microplastics or antibiotics on methane generation. However, there may also be complex reactions between them and their combine effects on anaerobic digestion remain unclear. This study revealed the combined influencing mechanism of polyamide and ofloxacin through batch and semi-continuous tests. Brief exposure to ofloxacin was detrimental to methane production. The coexistence of polyamide enabled partial adsorption of ofloxacin, which effectively mitigates the inhibitory effect of ofloxacin at low concentrations. Polyamide also facilitated the colonization of hydrolytic bacteria and acidogens, such as Hydrogenispora, and promoted the conversion of organic matter to acetate. However, polyamide could not effectively alleviate the inhibitory effect of excess ofloxacin on anaerobic digestion. Ofloxacin at high concentrations stimulated the release of humic acid, reduced methane production by more than 80\%, and changed the predominant methanogenesis pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Acidogenesis and methanogenesis pathways were restructured to further explore the effect of ofloxacin on the metabolic potentials of microorganisms. Metagenomic analysis revealed that most of functional genes associated with glycolysis, amino acid metabolism and methanogenesis were down regulated under longterm stress of high concentration of ofloxacin.

This work comprehensively revealed the hormesis effects of PHMG occurred in waste activated sludge (WAS) on the generation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during anaerobic fermentation. The low level of PHMG (100 mg/g TSS) significantly promoted the VFAs generation (1283 mg COD/L, compared with 337 mg COD/L in the control) via synchronously facilitating the solubilization, hydrolysis, and acidification steps but inhibiting methanogenesis. Metagenomic analysis showed that the functional anaerobe ( i.e., Bacteroides, Macellibacteroide and Parabacteroide) and corresponding genetic expressions responsible for extracellular hydrolysis (i.e., clpP), membrane transport (i.e., ffh and gspF), intracellular substrates metabolism (i.e., ald and paaF) and VFAs biosynthesis (i.e., ACACA and FASN) were enhanced in the optimal presence of PHMG. Moreover, the anaerobic species could respond and adapt to low PHMG stimuli via quorum sensing (i.e., cqsA, rpfC and rpfG), and thus maintain the high microbial metabolic activities.

This study explores the potential of Chrysopogon zizanioides (Vetiver) and Colocasia esculenta (Taro) in mitigating pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs)- metronidazole (MNZ), naproxen (NAP), and methylparaben (MeP), under hydroponic conditions. Both plants demonstrated similar specific uptake potentials for the target pollutants (5.23 to 5.76 mg/g of biomass dry weight), with pollutant accumulation in plants remaining very low (<10 \%). Notably, a substantial fraction of pollutants (66.27 \% to 78.42 \%) underwent metabolism. Qualitative analysis identified five MNZ and NAP metabolites and six MeP metabolites in plant tissues. Over a 28-day PPCPs exposure, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulted in reduced chlorophyll content, root activity, protein, and carbohydrates, alongside increased oxidative stress levels. The study highlighted distinct accumulation patterns, with NAP (anion) primarily in roots and MeP (cation) and MNZ (neutral) predominantly in aerial parts. Phloroglucinol staining confirmed the intact endodermis (Casparian Strips) in Vetiver roots, indicating symplastic transport of PPCPs to aerial parts. Moreover, significant morphological alterations were observed in plant roots exposed to target pollutants. During recuperation, a decrease in accumulated ROS indicates partial self-recovery from oxidative damage. In conclusion, both Vetiver and Taro emerge as promising candidates for removing specified PPCPs, emphasizing the critical role of addressing emerging contaminants for sustainable development and preserving the environment and human wellbeing.",,10.1016/j.cej.2024.149180,Naproxen;Metronidazole,NA,,fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products like metronidazole naproxen and methylparaben and their effect on the physiological characteristics of two wetland plants

This study proposed corroborating this trend, analyzing the available literature on the subject to verify how experts in the AOP area investigated this integration during 2015-2023. For this purpose, a sample of publications was treated by applying the Systematic Review (SR) methodology. This resulted in an extract of 83 studies that adopted life-cycle logic to estimate environmental impacts and process costs or evaluated them as complementary to the technical dimension of each treatment technology. This analysis found that both dimensions can be used for selecting or sizing AOPs at the design scale. However, the appropriate choice of the impact categories for the environmental assessment and establishing a methodology for cost analysis can make the approach still more effective. In addition, a staggering number of processes would broaden the reality and applicability of the estimates, and adopting multicriteria analysis methodologies could address essential aspects of decision-making processes during the design of the arrangements.

Although substantial studies have explored the dynamics and threats of microplastics in BCEs, the fate and driving factors of microplastics in BCEs on a global scale remain largely unknown. Here, the occurrence, driving factors, and risks of microplastics in global BCEs were investigated by synthesizing a global metaanalysis. The results showed that the abundance of microplastics in BCEs has notable spatial differences worldwide, with the highest microplastic concentrations in Asia, especially in South and Southeast Asia. Microplastic abundance is influenced by the vegetation habitat, climate, coastal environment, and river runoff. The interaction of geographic location, ecosystem type, coastal environment, and climate enhanced the effects of microplastic distribution. In addition, we found that microplastic accumulation in organisms varied according to feeding habits and body weight. Significant accumulation was observed in large fish; however, growth dilution effects were also observed. The effect of microplastics on the organic carbon content of sediments from BCEs varies by ecosystem; microplastic concentrations do not necessarily increase organic carbon sequestration. Global BCEs are at a high risk of microplastic pollution, with high microplastic abundance and toxicity driving the high pollution risk.

In contrast, the impacts of nonantibiotic drugs have been largely overlooked, and their regulation mechanism in anammox system remains unclear. In this study, the single and combined effects of typical antibiotic (doxycycline) and non-antibiotic drug (propranolol) on anammox consortia were evaluated and compared from process performance, community succession, metabolic and gene regulation perspectives. Significant reduction in the nitrogen removal efficiency (49.0 +/- 0.5\%) was only observed in the anammox process stressed by propranolol and doxycycline, but it was reversible. Metabolome results showed that anammox consortia upregulated amino acid metabolism under propranolol stress, while the abundance of pyrimidine and purine metabolic pathways significantly increased under doxycycline and multidrug stress. Microorganisms adapted to these stresses by changing the utilization preference for metabolites. Metagenomic analyses indicated that doxycycline and propranolol induced the high frequency of gene transfer through increasing oxidative stress level, membrane permeability, pili and efflux pumps. Significant correlations between ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), especially intI1, demonstrated the conjugative transfer of ARGs. Furthermore, structural equation models showed that microbial community, bacterial metabolism, MGEs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and corresponding SOS response were key driving factors for ARGs transfer in the anammox systems.

Benzophenone-8 (BP-8) is one of the main metabolites of BP-3 in organisms. Current reports show that BP-8 may be more toxic than BP-3. However, difference of their toxicities on embryonic development has rarely been reported. In this study, zebrafish embryos were chosen as the target organism to explore the developmental toxicities of BP-3 and BP-8. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis was performed to compare their modes of action. Results showed that BP-8 exposures led to higher bioaccumulation and lower hatching rate of zebrafish larvae than BP-3. Both BP-8 and BP-3 exposures caused behavioral abnormalities of zebrafish larvae, but no significant difference was found between them. At the metabolome level, 1 mu g/L BP-3 and 1 mu g/L BP-8 exposures altered neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and FoxO signaling pathway, respectively, which might be involved in the abnormal behaviors in zebrafish larvae. For higher exposure groups (30 and 300 mu g/L), both BP-3 and BP-8 exposures changed metabolism of cofactors and vitamins of zebrafish larvae. Exposure of BP-3 altered the metabolism by pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway, while BP-8 exposure changed riboflavin metabolism and folate biosynthesis.

Ibuprofen (IBP), as a typical anti-inflammatory drug, is frequently detected in water sources. Therefore, its removal using various adsorbents has drawn great interest. Herein, the structural, electronic, energetic, and optical properties of pristine oxo-triarylmethyl (oxTAM) and transition metal-doped oxo-triarylmethyl (TM@oxTAM, TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn) for adsorption of the IBU drug were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations implemented in Gaussian and VASP codes. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO), density of states (DOS), and electronic band structure results demonstrated that transition metaldoped oxTAM causes a significant reduction in the energy band gap (Eg) value of pristine oxTAM, with the highest decrease (30.14 \%) in the case of Mn@oxTAM. It was found that transition metal doping onto oxTAM leads to an increase in the adsorption energies (1.20-2.64 eV) and charge density between transition metal and IBU. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed that charge was effectively transferred from the IBU towards the transition metal, which was further analyzed by charge decomposition analysis (CDA). Furthermore, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), interaction region indicator (IRI), electron localization function (ELF), and radial distribution function (RDF) analyses revealed that the IBU is adsorbed on the Sc@oxTAM surface via covalent interactions, while electrostatic with partially covalent interactions are dominated in other IBU/TM@oxTAM complexes. The results suggest that TM doping on the oxTAM provides a new insight for developing photocatalyst-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to remove emerging pollutants in wastewater.",,10.1016/j.jmgm.2023.108647,Adsorption;Ibuprofen,NA,,theoretical design of transition metaldoped oxotriarylmethyl as a disposable platform for adsorption of ibuprofen

This study demonstrated that the up-regulation of ferroptosis associated proteins genes were accompanied with the down-regulation of AMPKa2 phosphorylation in DOX treated mouse heart or neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). AMPKa2 knockout (AMPKa2-/-) significantly exacerbated mouse cardiac dysfunction, increased mortality, promoting ferroptosis associated mitochondrial injuries, enhanced ferroptosis associated proteins and genes expression, and lead to accumulation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mouse serum and hearts respectively.

The main way to deal with this insect is to use insecticides. Due to the resistance from insecticides, the fight against house flies has been hampered. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies worldwide.Methods: This study was conducted via a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies. Accord-ingly, by searching the databases of Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Proquest, Bioone, and Embase, all published articles were extracted, and reviewed until the end of May 2022.

Fishes are the main group of organisms studied in aquatic toxicology, and their behaviours, including feeding, courtship, parental care, and territoriality, are essential to their health. Cichlids are one of the most abundant fish families and are both economically and ecologically relevant. In this review, we found that metals, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and endocrine disruptor chemicals are the main groups of pollutants that have been studied in the context of cichlid behaviour. African tilapias are the most evaluated cichlids on this topic, and Nile tilapia was the most frequently studied species. Exposure to these pollutants has been shown to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming, activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances, and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods. It is also important to consider more pollutants-both individually and in combination-such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and microplastics, due the increasing relevance of these pollutants of emerging concern.

In this study, we aim to develop a nanoparticle-imprinted hydrogel (NPIH, NANOGEL) to detect and capture NPs in water samples. The principle of the Nanogel originates from the well-known concept of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Cadmium sulfide/Selenide/Zinc sulfide core/shell quantum dots (QDs) were used as the template NP, creating specific pore cavities in the Nanogel that can selectively bind to certain analytes. Quantification of NPs detected in water samples was then made possible by transducing this selective detection process into an analytical signal using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The Nanogel was shown to demonstrate good repeatability, reproducibility, and stability in terms of its performance. The high selectivity of the Nanogel was determined to be attributed to the size of cavities and their surface characteristics. Ionic interference was present and, heavy metal cations showed an affinity for the NANOGEL synthesized; however, they were demonstrated to be minimized by the selection of porogenic solvents during the synthesis of NANOGEL.

MPs are emerging pollutants in croplands and water systems with significant ecological risks, particularly over the long term. In the soil systems, MPs polymer type, thinness, shape, and size induces numerous effects on soil aggregates, dissolved organic carbon (C), rapidly oxidized organic C, microbial biomass C, microbial biomass nitrogen (N), microbial immobilization, degradation of organic matter, N cycling, and production of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), thereby posing a significant risk of impairing soil physical and biochemical properties over time. Further, toxic chemicals released from polyethylene mulching (PMs) might indirectly harm plant growth by affecting soil wetting-drying cycles, releasing toxic substances that interact with soil matrix, and suppressing soil microbial activity. In the environment, accumulation of MPs poses a risk to human health by accelerating emissions of GHGs, e.g., methane and carbon dioxide, or directly releasing toxic substances such as phthalic acid esters (PAEs) into the soils. Also, larger sizes MPs can adhere to root surface and block stomata could significantly change the shape of root epidermal cells resulting in arrest plant growth and development by restricting water-nutrient uptake, and gene expression and altering the biodiversity of the soil pollutants. In this review, we systematically analyzed the potential risks of MPs to the soil-plant and human body, their occurrence, abundance, and migration in agroecosystems. Further, the impacts of MPs on soil microbial function, nutrient cycling, soil C, and GHGs are mechanistically reviewed, with emphasis on potential green solutions such as organic materials amendments along with future research directions for more ecofriendly and sustainable plastic management in agroecosystems.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165688,,NA,,ecological risks of microplastics contamination with green solutions and future perspectives

In the present study, a novel aerobic denitrifying phosphate-accumulating bacterial strain RL-GZ01 was found to be able to utilize phthalic acid esters (PAEs) as carbon resource for cell growth. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, physiological and biochemical characterization, and genome-based average nucleotide identity calculation, RL-GZ01 was identified as Rhodococcus pyridinivorans. Strain RL-GZ01 showed high DEHP degradation in alkaline conditions and good tolerance of salinity and organic solvents. The degradation of DEHP by RL-GZ01 fitted well with a modified Gompertz model (R-2 = 0.9985). Metabolic intermediates of DEHP were identified via UHPLC-MS/MS analysis and the catabolic pathway was proposed thereafter. Genes and gene clusters contributed to the utilization of DEHP were analyzed through genomic analysis. Analysis of KEGG nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated that nitrate and nitrite were further transformed into ammonium which was further used for the biosynthesis of L-glutamine and L-glutamate. Strain RLGZ01 was further identified as a denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism which can accumulate phosphate by generating polyphosphate. Finally, strain RL-GZ01 was applied to municipal wastewater treatment for simultaneous removal of nitrogen, phosphate and DEHP. The removal percentages of DEHP (5 mg/L), TN (71.2 mg/L), NH4+-N (70.9 mg/L), PO43--P (10.89 mg/L) and COD (622.4 mg/L) by strain RL-GZ01 were 89.94 \%, 64.45 \%, 64.94 \%, 76.30 \% and 63.23 \% within 84 h, respectively.

Research has shown that persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and phthalate metabolites, are associated with a higher risk of abnormal blood lipid levels in humans. However, the key molecules involved in dyslipidemia and the mecha-nisms are not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the biomarkers that mediate the relationships between blood lipids and four groups of POPs and revealed their potential mechanisms. Specifically, in 278 male blood samples, blood lipid and POPs levels were measured and metabolites were detected using untargeted metabolomics. Spearman's correlation analysis and binary logistic regression were employed to assess the relationship between POPs and lipid indexes. We observed that PFASs were associated with a higher risk of abnormal total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), while other POPs displayed little association with abnormal lipid indexes. Among all the PFASs, 6:2Cl-PFESA was associated with the fewest metabolites. A metabolome-wide association study combined with a meet-in-the-middle approach was used to identify potential biomarkers that mediate the association between POPs and abnormal blood lipids. The mediation analysis pointed to 105 significant mediators as potential biomarkers mediating the association between PFASs and TC, and 82 significant mediators were potential biomarkers that mediated the association between PFASs and LDL. 24-Hydroxycholesterol, 3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-al, PC(18:0/0:0), PC(22:5/0:0), GPCho (18:1/18:1), LysoPC(22:2(13Z,16Z)), LysoPC(16:0), 9(S)-HODE, 9,10-DHOME, L-glutamate, 4-hydroxybutyric acid, cytosine, PC(14:1(9Z)/18:0), sphinganine, and (S)-beta-aminoisobutyrate were identified as important biomarkers. The mechanism may mainly involves glycerophospholipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosyn-thesis, and linoleic acid metabolism. PPAR gamma likely plays a role in the associations between PFASs and abnormal cholesterol metabolism.

This work revealed the effects of ZPT on the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during WAS anaerobic digestion, in which VFAs yield was enhanced by approximately 6-9 folds (from 353 mg COD/L in control to 2526-3318 mg COD/L with low level of ZPT (20-50 mg/g TSS)). The ZPT occurred in WAS enabled the acceleration of solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification processes while inhibited the methanogenesis. Also, the low ZPT contributed to the enrichment of functional hydrolytic -acidifying microorganisms (e.g., Ottowia and Acinetobacter) but caused the reduction of methanogens (e.g., Methanomassiliicoccus and Methanothrix). Meta-transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the critical genes relevant to extracellular hydrolysis (i.e. CLPP and ZapA), membrane transport (i.e. gltI, and gltL), substrates metabolisms (i.e. fadj, and acd), and VFAs biosynthesis (i.e. porB and porD) were all upregulated by 25.1-701.3\% with low level of ZPT. Specifically, the ZPT stimulus on amino acids metabolism for VFAs transformation was prominent over carbohydrates. Moreover, the functional species enabled to regulate the genes in QS and TCS systems to maintain favorable cell chemotaxis to adapt the ZPT stress. The cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance pathway was upregulated to blunt ZPT with the secretion of more lipopolysaccharide and activate proton pumps to maintain ions homeostasis to antagonize the ZPT toxicity for high microbial activities, the abundance of related genes was up-regulated by 60.5 to 524.5\%.

Among PhACs, the anti-inflammatory ibuprofen (IBU) and the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) are two of the most used compounds whose presence has been reported in different aquatic environments worldwide. However, there is still scarce information about the cellular and molecular alterations provoked by IBU and OTC on aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms as microalgae, even more if we refer to their potential combined toxicity. To test the cyto- and genotoxicity provoked by IBU, OTC and their binary combination on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a flow cytometric panel was performed after 24 h of single and co-exposure to both contaminants. Assayed parameters were cell vitality, metabolic activity, intracellular ROS levels, and other programmed cell death (PCD)-related biomarkers as cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potentials and caspase-like and endonuclease activities. In addition, a nuclear DNA fragmentation analysis by comet assay was carried out. For most of the parameters analysed (vitality, metabolic activity, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potentials, and DNA fragmentation) the most severe damages were observed in the cultures exposed to the binary mixture (IBU+OTC), showing a joint cyto- and genotoxicity effect. Both PhACs and their mixture caused a remarkable decrease in cell proliferation and metabolic activity and markedly increased intracellular ROS levels, parallel to a noticeable depolarization of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, a strong increase in both caspase and endonuclease activities as well as a PCD-related loss of nuclear DNA integrity was observed in all treatments. Results analysis showed that the PhACs caused cell death on this non-target organism, involving mitochondrial membrane depolarization, enhanced ROS production and activation of PCD process.

In this systematic review, results on the link between organochlorine pesticide pollution and CVD were collected from databases (Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Science Direct) in May 2022 from studies published between 2010 and 2022. A total of 24 articles were selected for this systematic review. Sixteen articles were extracted by reviewers using a standardized form that included cross-sectional, cohort, and ecological studies that reported exposure to organochlorine pesticides in association with increased CVD risk. In addition, eight articles covering molecular mechanisms organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on cardiovascular effects were retrieved for detailed evaluation. Based on the findings of the study, it seems elevated circulating levels of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs increase the risk of coronary heart disease, especially in early life exposure to these pesticides and especially in men. Changes in the regulatory function of peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma receptor (PPAR gamma), reduction of paroxonase activity (PON1), epigenetic changes of histone through induction of reactive oxygen species, vascular endothelial inflammation with miR-expression 126 and miR-31, increased collagen synthesis enzymes in the extracellular matrix and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and fibrosis are mechanisms by which PCBs increase the risk of CVD. According to this systematic review, organochlorine pesticide exposure is associated with increased risk of CVD and CVD mortality through the atherogenic and inflammatory molecular mechanism involving fatty acid and glucose metabolism.",,10.34172/aim.2023.86,Cardiovascular Diseases;Pesticides,NA,,insights into organochlorine pesticides exposure in the development of cardiovascular diseases a systematic review

We aim to explore the efficacy and indication(s) of PCD in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD).Methods The search was conducted across Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PubMed. Data on study design, patient demographics, pre- and post-procedure Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and complications were extracted. Inclusion criteria focused on adult patients with degenerative spinal diseases treated with cement discoplasty. The overall effect size was evaluated using a forest plot, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I-2 statistic and chi-squared test.Results The search strategy yielded six studies, which included 336 patients (73.8\% female, 26.2\% male) with a mean average age of 74.6 years. VAS scores were reported in all studies, showing a significant difference between pre- and post-PCD pain scores (Weighted Mean Difference {[}WMD]: -3.45; 95\% CI: -3.83, -3.08; I-2 = 15\%; P < .001). ODI scores were reported in 83\% of studies, with a significant difference between pre- and post-PCD scores (WMD: -22.22; 95\% CI: -25.54, -18.89; I-2 = 61\%; p < .001). Complications reported included infections, thrombophlebitis, vertebral fractures, disc extrusion, and the need for further operations.Conclusions The analysis showed clinically significant improvements in pain and functional disability based on VAS and ODI scores. However, due to methodological limitations and a high risk of bias, the validity and generalizability of the findings are uncertain. Despite these issues, the results provide preliminary insights into PCD's potential efficacy and can guide future research to address current limitations.",,10.1177/19714009231212368,Spinal Diseases,NA,,efficacy and safety of percutaneous cement discoplasty in the management of degenerative spinal diseases a systematic review and metaanalysis

We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo{[}a]pyrene {[}BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered.

Food contamination with pesticide residues (PRs) is a serious concern, especially in developing countries. Several research reports revealed that some Brazilian farmers spray pesticides on fruits and vegetables in large quantities, generating PRs after harvest. Thus, ingestion of food contaminated with PRs can cause adverse health effects. Based on information obtained through a systematic review of essential information from 33 articles, we studied the assessment of potential health risks associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in children and adults from Brazilian states. This study identified 111 PRs belonging to different chemical groups, mainly organophosphates and organochlorines, in 26 fruit and vegetable samples consumed and exported by Brazil. Sixteen of these PRs were above the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) established by local and international legislation. We did not identify severe acute and chronic dietary risks, but the highest risk values were observed in Sa tilde o Paulo and Santa Catarina, associated with the consumption of tomatoes and sweet peppers due to the high concentrations of organophosphates. A high long-term health risk is associated with the consumption of oranges in Sa tilde o Paulo and grapes in Bahia due to chlorothalonil and procymidone. We also identified that 26 PRs are considered carcinogenic by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), and the carcinogenic risk analysis revealed no severe risk in any Brazilian state investigated due to the cumulative hazard index (HI) < 1. However, the highest HI values were in Sa tilde o Paulo due to acephate and carbaryl in sweet pepper and in Bahia due to dichlorvos. This information can help regulatory authorities define new guidelines for pesticide residue limits in fruits and vegetables commonly consumed and exported from Brazil and monitor the quality of com-mercial formulations.",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138244,Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,,consumption of fruits and vegetables contaminated with pesticide residues in brazil a systematic review with health risk assessment

VL is transmitted by different species of sandflies and key strategies against VL rely on the control of the vectors. This systematic review assesses the efficacy and community effectiveness of indoor residual spraying (IRS) in controlling sandflies and VL occurrence among humans. After a revision of 8822 initial hits, 21 studies were included in this systematic review.Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts by up to 95\% for at least one month. DDT has been used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over time. Combinations of different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as key issues for control programmes. No human transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS on human transmission,-although by modelling studies an effect of IRS on human transmission can be demonstrated. Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is one of the interventions to control the vectors of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Different insecticides are used in affected countries, also in the Regional Initiative for the Elimination of VL in South-East Asia. This systematic review assesses all available studies analysing the effectiveness of IRS on the key vectors of VL. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, with a broad search strategy, applied to seven key databases. Inclusion criteria were studies focusing on 1) Visceral leishmaniasis 2) Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) or synonyms, and 3) all primary research methods. 21 studies were included, five cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), one randomised controlled trial (RCT), 11 intervention studies, also included were three modelling studies and one survey. 19 out of 21 included studies were published between 2009 and 2020. 18 of the studies were conducted in the context of the Regional Initiative. Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, confirmed in terms of effectiveness and by the availability of studies. Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts, and/or Phlebotomus argentipes counts by up to 95\% with an effect of a minimum of one month. Prolonged effects are not regularly seen. DDT has been used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over time. Two intervention studies, embedded in larger programmes in 2019 and 2020, replaced DDT with alpha-Cypermethrin throughout the study. Combinations of different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as key issues for programmes. No human transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS-although modelling studies confirm the effect of IRS on human transmission. Concluding, IRS continues to be an effective intervention for Phlebotomus argentipes control. Delivery requires constant monitoring and quality assurance.

Industrial park wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treat large amounts of comprehensive wastewater derived from industrial production and park human activity, which is possible a source of ARGs and pathogens. Therefore, this study investigated the occurrence and prevalence of ARGs, ARGs hosts and pathogens and assesses the ARGs health risk in the biological treatment process in a large-sale industrial park WWTP using metagenomic analysis and omics-based framework, respectively. Results show that the major ARG subtypes are multidrug resistance genes (MDRGs), macB, tetA(58), evgS, novA, msbA and bcrA and the ARGs main hosts were genus Acidovorax, Pseudomonas, Mesorhizobium. In particular, all determined ARGs genus level hosts are pathogens. The total removal percentage of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens were 12.77 \%, 12.96\% and 25.71\% respectively, suggesting that the present treatment could not efficiently remove these pollutants. The relative abundance of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens varied along biological treatment process that ARGs and MDRGs were enriched in activated sludge and pathogens were enriched in both secondary sedimentation tank and activated sludge. Among 980 known ARGs, 23 ARGs (e.g., ermB, gadX and tetM) were assigned into risk Rank I with characters of enrichment in the human-associated environment, gene mobility and pathogenicity. The results indicate that industrial park WWTPs might serve as an important source of ARGs, MDRGs, and pathogens.

In addition, function (e.g., CAZy, eggNOG and KEGG) is also an important biotic factor; however, how function correlates to ARGs and thus contributes to the antibiotic resistome remains ambiguous. This work explores the effect of sulfonamides (SAs) on ARGs and MGEs by a metagenomic analysis, a principal component analysis (PCA), and a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS). Then, the work establishes a correlation between ARGs and function with a co-occurrence network and reveals the contribution and positive (negative)/direct (indirect) effect of taxonomy, MGEs, and function to the antibiotic resistome by variation partitioning analysis (VPA) and partial least-squares-path modeling (PLS-PM). The results show that the soil has diverse ARGs and several MGEs and SAs impose significant effects on them. Further, CAZy, eggNOG, and KEGG (including pathway and orthology) show strong and significant correlation with ARGs on the basis of the co-occurrence network; however, in our system it seems that only the KEGG pathway promotes the interpretation of ARGs and should be regarded as the priority function on considering the role of function in structuring the antibiotic resistome.

This paper was aimed at performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of population studies exploring whether human male exposure to EDCs affects male fertility. Clinical and observational studies assessing the exposure to EDCs along with sperm quality, the most common reproductive disorders, sperm DNA damage, sperm oxidative stress, fertilization rate, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate were included. The quality assessment tool from the NHLBI-NIH was used to assure that studies met standardized quality criteria. Sensitivity analysis and heterogeneity among studies was assessed. Overall, the 32 selected articles, including 7825 individuals in the systematic review, explored 12 families of EDCs. The results revealed a high heterogeneity among studies in relation to the association between exposure to EDCs and the endpoints analyzed. Meta-analyses were performed with data from 7 articles including 479 individuals, 4 articles assessing the association between BPA in urine and sperm quality, and 3 articles evaluating PCB153 in serum and sperm quality. In the meta-analysis, we identified an unpredicted significant positive association between PCB153 exposure and sperm concentration. However, it would not be clinically relevant. No positive or inverse associations were found neither for BPA, nor for PCB153 and the rest of sperm parameters analyzed. The high disparity between studies made difficult to draw conclusions on the potential harmful effects of EDCs on male fertility.

With the awareness of the impact of MPs on the environment increasing over the last years, the need for increased monitoring as well as comprehensive analysis to better understand the fate and impact of MPs has become more and more important. A major aspect of MP characterization is the assignment of the polymer type of individual particles. Here, per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), originating from fluor-containing polymers, have gained a lot of attention due to the severe environmental impact. Additionally, quantitative analysis of the metal content is of great interest in the field, since MPs are prone to either leaching (in)organic additives into the environment or taking up and accumulating hazardous components (e.g., heavy metals). In this work we demonstrate the capabilities of a simultaneous LIBS/LA-ICP-MS setup for the analysis of MPs. In the first part, we demonstrate the potential of targeted LIBS analysis for the imaging of fluor-containing polymers. Using a laser spot size of 5 mu m combined with highly sensitive ICCD detection enables analysis of particles in the low mu m range. In the second part we combine the polymer-identification capabilities of LIBS with the high sensitivity of ICP-MS to perform matrix-matched quantification of the metal content of individual MPs. In this case we use a spot size of 50 mu m facilitating polymer classification with a broadband spectrometer, resulting in detection limits of 0.72 mu g/g for Pb and 9.5 mu g/g for Sn simultaneously measured using ICP-MS.",,10.1016/j.talanta.2023.125500,Multiple Sclerosis;Intracranial Hypertension,NA,,capabilities of simultaneous 193 nm libslaicpms imaging for microplastics characterization

The Workshop arose from a previous workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on `Late Lessons from Early Warnings' (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those agents. Results: Workshop participants used recent case studies including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency - Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations, which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public's health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence of financial conflicts of interest. Conclusion: The recommendations should enhance the production of ``actionable evidence, `` that is, reliable evaluations of the scientific evidence to support timely actions to protect health and environments from exposures to hazardous agents.

TCGA database samples were collected, and the correlation between purine metabolism-related genes and ICC clinical features was analyzed using R language to obtain the differential genes including PPAT, PFAS, ATIC, and IMPDH2. High PPAT expression was associated with poor ICC prognosis. A PPAT silencing model in HCCC-9810 cells was constructed. The cell phenotype was examined by qRT-PCR, CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry, showing a decrease in IMPDH1 expression, colony and invasive cells numbers, and an increase in apoptosis.

The healthy FT provides the biological environment for successful fertilization and facilitates the subsequent movement of the conceptus to the endometrial cavity. However, when the FT is damaged, as with salpingitis, pyosalpinx, and hydrosalpinx, it may increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition. Decidualization refers to a multifactorial process by which the endometrium changes to permit blastocyst implantation. The decidualization reaction is vital for endometrial receptivity during the window of implantation. To date, no comprehensive review that collates evidence on decidualization in the human FT has been conducted. Therefore, the aim of this review is to compile the current evidence on cellular decidualization occurring in the healthy and pathological FT in women of reproductive age. A literature search was conducted using five databases and identified 746 articles, 24 of which were analyzed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The available evidence indicates that the FT are able to undergo decidual changes under specific circumstances; however, the exact mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood.

Background Treatment failure is considered to be an important factor in relation to the increase in scabies incidence over the last decade. However, the regional and temporal differences, in addition to the predictors of therapy failure, are unclear.Objectives We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the prevalence of treatment failure in patients with scabies and investigation of associated factors.Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 2021 for randomized and quasi-randomized trials, in addition to observational studies that enrolled children or adults diagnosed with confirmed or clinical scabies treated with permethrin, ivermectin, crotamiton, benzyl benzoate, malathion, sulfur or lindane, and measured treatment failure or factors associated with treatment failure. We performed a random effects meta-analysis for all outcomes reported by at least two studies.Results A total of 147 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. The overall prevalence of treatment failure was 15.2\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-17.6; I2 = 95.3\%, moderate-certainty evidence] with regional differences between World Health Organization regions (P = 0.003) being highest in the Western Pacific region (26.9\%, 95\% CI 14.5-41.2).

This paper is the first formal meta-analysis to examine the phytotoxic effects of microplastics and their impact on soil functions in the plant-soil system. Our specific aims were to: 1) determine how the type and size of microplastics affect plant and soil health, 2) identify which agricultural plants are more sensitive to microplastics, and 3) investigate how the frequency and amount of microplastic pollution affect soil functions. Plant morphology, antioxidant production and photosynthesis ca-pacity were impacted by the composition of polymers in microplastics, and the responses could be negative, positive or neutral depending on the polymer type. Phytotoxicity testing revealed that maize (Zea mays) was more sensitive than rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) within the Poaceae family, while wheat and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were less sensitive to microplastics exposure. Microplastics-impacted soils tend to be more porous and retain more water, but this did not improve soil stability or increase soil microbial diversity, sug-gesting that microplastics occupied physical space but were not integrated into the soil biophysical matrix.

Because of the excellent thermal stability, high surface activity, lipophobicity and hydrophobicity, they are widely used in different fields such as non-stick coatings, dental floss, and aqueous film-forming foams. PFASs inevitably enter the environments by industrial and domestic emissions, and exist stably in the environment. In recent years, PFASs pollution becomes a global environmental problem. Microorganisms are an indispensable part of the ecosystems, acting as an important participant in the material cycle and energy flow. Both microbial surfaces and PFASs are relatively hydrophobic, and hydrophobic interaction facilitates PFASs to contact microorganisms, which further inhibit their activity. In turn, microorganisms could affect the transformation and fate of PFASs. Therefore, it is of importance to systematically summarize the interaction between PFASs and microorganisms in order to provide critical information for better understanding the environmental risks of PFASs. This review systematically expounded the interaction between PFASs and environmental microorganisms. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of PFASs to bacteria was highlighted. It was found that PFASs could promote the synthesis and release of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and affect the composition and structure of EPS, thereby inhibiting the activity of extracellular enzymes or destroying the integrity of biofilm. In addition, hydrophobic interaction promoted the penetration of PFASs to the phospholipid bilayer, increasing the fluidity and permeability of the membrane. Furthermore, the increase of membrane permeability caused bacterial metabolism disorder, which resulted in the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS could oxidize unsaturated fatty acids to malondialdehyde (MDA), and induce crosslinking of nucleic acids and lead to DNA damage. Secondly, this review elucidated the impact of PFASs on the microbial communities in the environments. In the soil and freshwater environments, the changes of bacterial abundance are mainly regulated by PFASs concentrations. It is worth noting that PFASs at high concentration (>10 mg/kg) reduced the abundance of bacteria related to soil nitrogen transformation and phosphorus metabolism, thus posing a potential threat to the cycling capacities of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. Additionally, sulfur cycle and nitrification process in freshwater environment are inhibited by high-concentration PFASs (>10 mg/L). In terms of the marine environment, the impact of PFASs on microbial communities was much lower than that of environmental parameters (e.g., nutrient substances and salinity). Finally, the microbial transformation pathway of PFASs was discussed. The biofilm formed by microorganisms and their extracellular secretions could adsorb and transform/degrade PFASs by different reactions (e.g., Feammox, desulfurization and hydrolysis), mediating by extracellular enzymes (e.g., C-SO3- bond lyase, phosphatase and polyurethane enzyme), thus affecting the toxicity and fate of PFASs. Moreover, the challenges and future perspectives were addressed. PFASs in the biofilm could be transferred to the organisms at higher trophic level through the parasitic or predatory food chains. Therefore, the risk of PFASs along the microbe-based food chain should be further investigated. In addition, microorganisms existed in the environments usually in the form of community. Current research on the molecular mechanisms of PFASs on microbial quorum sensing is relatively lacking, and deserves an in-depth investigation. Finally, due to the lack of some metabolite standards and instrument detection limit, there are still unidentified transformation products in the biotransformation pathways of PFASs. The issues highlighted above are suggested to be focused on the further investigations.",,10.1360/TB-2022-0948,,NA,,interaction between per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and microorganisms

Studies have reported the toxicity of combined pollutants on the performance and mi-crobial community in sequencing batch reactors. However, the influence of combined pollutants on nitrogen removal in wetlands remains unclear. Here, an 84 d exposure experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of cadmium (Cd) and doxycycline (DC) on nitrogen metabolism in ecological ditches using metagenomic anal-ysis. The results showed that adding 50 mg L-1 DC at 5 mg L-1 Cd stress deteriorated nitrogen removal per-formance and significantly increased N2O emissions and lactate dehydrogenase release. However, a low level of Cd (0.5 mg L-1) significantly reduced N2O emissions under the high DC concentration pressure (50 mg L-1). The increasing Cd concentration markedly weakened the inhibition of DC (1 mg L-1) on the relative abundances of the dominant genera. Moreover, high concentrations of mixed Cd/DC showed stronger inhibitory effects on glucokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase. NADH had a higher tolerance to mixed Cd/DC than ATP. However, low levels of mixed Cd/DC led to a higher abundance of key denitrifying enzymes and genes. The assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway increased under the mixture of Cd/DC stress, accompanied by an increase in ferredoxin-nitrite/nitrate reductase and the abundance of nasA and nirA genes. Our results indicate that the presence of low-level Cd could alleviate the impact of DC on nitrogen removal and N2O emissions in ecological ditches by altering microbial community and enzymatic activity associated with transport, metabolism, and gene expression. However, the increasing Cd concentration at DC stress could intensify the combined toxicity.

Pollution from heavy metal namely, arsenic, cadmium, nickel, mercury, chromium, zinc, lead etc. is becoming a major health risk. Many diseases like gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders, skin lesions, vascular damage, immune system dysfunction, birth defects, and cancer are associated with heavy metal poisoning. Adsorption-based methods are highly popular and advantageous because of their low cost, high retention time, and good recyclability. Carbon dots are emerging as green adsorbents of recent times for various categories of water contaminants including heavy metals. The use of bio sources as a green precursor to carbon dot synthesis is opening a huge opportunity to fabricate inexpensive materials for heavy metal remediation in the future. With very high surface functionalities and large speific surface area, the adsorption of heavy metals as high as 2000 mg g-1 is achievable.

Meta-analysis results showed that exposure to PAEs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.07 (1.00, 1.14)], PFASs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.10 (1.01, 1.19)], as well as PCBs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.18 (1.02, 1.36)] and PBDEs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.33 (1.17, 1.50)] significantly increased the risk of GDM, but no significant effects were found for phenols, OCPs, and parabens. In addition, experimental studies suggested that the potential biological mechanisms of environmental pollutants contributing to GDM may involve insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, neurohormonal dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetic modification, and alterations in gut microbiome. In conclusion, long-term environmental pollutants exposure may induce the development of GDM, and there may be a synergistic effect between the homologs. However, studies conducted on the direct biological link between environmental pollutants and GDM were few. More prospective studies and high-quality in vivo and in vitro experiments were needed to investigate the specific ef-fects and mechanisms.",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138866,"Pregnancy;Diabetes, Gestational",NA,,environmental pollutants exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies

This is compounded by the increasing pollution levels with increasing population and industrialization. Activated carbon remains the most widely used adsorbent for the removal of chemical pollutants in both drinking water and wastewater treatment processes due to its unique chemical properties and a plethora of precursor materials for development. However, to date, no available literature has systematically summarized the advances in Africa on the adsorptive removal of contaminants using activated carbons and research issues such as data acquisition and presentation, analysis approaches, citations, inconsistencies and adsorption experimental setups remain largely undocumented. In this paper, adsorption studies from Africa focusing on activated carbons for the removal of various contaminants are reviewed, from 2007 to 2022. The study focused on a literature-based approach by searching key terms in selected databases. The adsorption data were mostly best described by the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models for dyes, anions, metal ions pesticides, and pharmaceutical compounds. According to the pooled data, the highest adsorption capacity was 1552.5 mg g-1 for PFOS adsorbed onto H3PO4-activated maize tassel-based carbon. The majority of the studies relied on linearized adsorption isotherm and kinetic models with coefficient of determination (R2) as the sole criterion for determining best-fitting models. Additionally, the majority of the studies are batch mode and laboratory-scale studies with no desorption and recyclability evaluations. Researchers should be careful to present accurate equations and units of parameters with proper citations. Pilot -scale and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the reported new materials represent an aspect largely unexplored. The fact that studies from most African countries, dating beyond 2007, could be obtained implies that activated carbons present an accessible and possibly sustainable technology for emerging economies.",,10.1016/j.apsadv.2023.100501,,NA,,recent advances and issues in the application of activated carbon for water treatment in africa a systematic review 20072022

The synthesized nanomaterials were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques, such as TEM, FTIR, UV-vis, XRD, and SEM-EDX-mapping to confirm the formation of nanocomposite material. The synthesized materials were explored as photocatalysts for the degradation of xylenol orange (XO) under a visible light source and a comparative study was explored to check the efficiency of the bimetallic co-doped nanocomposite to the pristine metal tungstate NPs. XRD analysis proved that reinforcement of Co2+ in ZnWO4 lattice results in a reduction in interplanar distance from 0.203 nm to 0.185 nm, which is reflected in its crystallite size, which reduced from 32 nm to 24 nm. Contraction in crystallite size reflects on the optical properties as the energy bandgap of ZnWO4 reduced from 3.49 eV to 3.33 eV in Zn0.5Co0.5WO4, which is due to the formation of a Z-scheme for charge transfer and enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency. The experimental results suggested that ZnWO4, CoWO4, and Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 NPs achieved a photocatalytic efficiency of 97.89\%, 98.10\%, and 98.77\% towards XO in 120 min of visible solar light irradiation. The kinetics of photodegradation was best explained by pseudo-first-order kinetics and the values of apparent rate const (k(app)) also supported the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of mixed metal Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 NPs towards XO degradation.",,10.3390/catal13020404,,NA,,hydrothermal synthesis of bimetallic zn co codoped tungstate nanocomposite with direct zscheme for enhanced photodegradation of xylenol orange

Insulin infusion sets interface with the skin surface, the dermis, and the subcutaneous space and may be the cause of infusion failure due to biological events or mechanical problems. Novel IISs with extended wear time and anti-inflammatory properties to mitigate these issues are described in the literature although material-tissue interactions are poorly understood. This rapid review focuses on the impact of IIS materials and designs on the subcutaneous response in people with diabetes and includes literature identified in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Twenty-one studies were identified for qualitative synthesis that encompassed a limited and heterogenic body of evidence including 10 clinical reports, six reviews, one case report, two abstracts, and two communications. Two clinical reports were randomized crossover studies. Reports on materials mostly compared steel versus polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) cannulas and suggested no substantial difference in tissue response to these materials. Reports on designs focused mostly on the angle of cannula insertion. To drive and improve research on extended wear and nonimmunogenic IISs, future studies should focus on material-tissue interaction as dedicated outcome measures, quantified with punch biopsy and imaging techniques such as ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and confocal reflectance microscopy.

In recent years, treatment by means of vessel transposition has become more frequent, as in singular cases of recurrence, nerval reactions towards interposed material have been noted. In this review we research the classic microvascular decom-pression (MVD) techniques (interposition) as well as the more recent transposition and their effectiveness, considering patient outcomes as well as complications and recurrences.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched online databases MEDLINE and LIVIVO, using key words trigeminal neuralgia AND transposition/ AND sling/ AND non compressive technique/ AND microvascular decompression.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We included 8 studies for transposition and 20 studies for the interposition, combining for 2045 patients (302 for transposition and 1743 for interposition). 96.1\% of patients in the transposition and 93.1\% in the interposition group reported a positive outcome immediately postoperatively. At follow-up, 87.4\% in the transposition group (follow-up 51.2 months) and 87.9\% of patients in the interposition group (follow-up 36.5 months), reported a positive outcome. 16.2\% of patients in the transposition and 13.1\% in the interposition group had postoperative complications. Recurrence was reported in 5.6\% of patients treated with transposition and 2.3\% of patients treated with interposi-tion. CONCLUSIONS: Transposition presents similar results concerning short-and long-term patient satisfaction for treatment of TGN as well as similar numbers of complications of recurrences as interposition.

In order to ensure the continuous resource supply of Pb-Zn and associated dispersed metals, it is urgent to explore the direction of further prospecting for them. Fractal theory can realize the fractal structure characterization of fault structures and the spatial distribution of mineral deposits, which is helpful for mineral exploration. However, the fault fractal research and prospecting application are still seldom covered in the EGMB. We used fractal theory to determine fine-scale fractal structure characteristics of fault structures and ore deposits in the EGMB, and Fry analysis to delineate favorable metallogenic areas. The results show that within a scale range of 3.670-58.716 km, the integrated faults capacity dimension (CPD) is 1.5095, the information dimension (IND) is 1.5391, and the correlation dimension (CRD) is 1.5436, indicating fault structures with high maturity, which are conducive to the migration and accumulation of ore-forming fluids.

Scholars recognise that data management is the next frontier in infection prevention, but many aspects related to the benefits and advantages of using DDTs to mitigate SSI risk factors remain unclear and underexplored in the literature. This study explores how DDTs enable value creation in the prevention of SSIs. This study follows a systematic literature review approach and the PRISMA statement to analyse peer-reviewed articles from seven databases. Fifty-nine articles were included in the review and were analysed through a descriptive and a thematic analysis. The findings suggest a growing interest in DDTs in SSI prevention in the last 5 years, and that machine learning and smartphone applications are widely used in SSI prevention. DDTs are mainly applied to prevent SSIs in clean and clean-contaminated surgeries and often used to manage patient-related data in the postoperative stage. DDTs enable the creation of nine categories of value that are classified in four dimensions: cost/sacrifice, functional/instrumental, experiential/hedonic, and symbolic/expressive. This study offers a unique and systematic overview of the value creation aspects enabled by DDT applications in SSI prevention and suggests that additional research is needed in four areas: value co-creation and product-service systems, DDTs in contaminated and dirty surgeries, data legitimation and explainability, and data-driven interventions.",,10.1007/s41666-023-00129-2,,NA,,datadriven technologies as enablers for value creation in the prevention of surgical site infections a systematic review

Methods The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects-mainly from a patient-perspective. Results A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90\% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? Conclusions Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future.

Moreover, the emerging issue of multi-resistance against traditional antibiotics obligates specialists to turn to new alternative agents. However, cases of Fosfomycin-resistant strains are being detected at a rising rate worldwide, among humans and animals. The objective of this review is to collect, present and analyze studies related to Fosfomycin resistance in isolates from companion animals and specifically dogs and cats. Variable articles were collected and data for the relevant strains were scanned and evaluated. Since Fosfomycin is an agent not routinely used by veterinarians, the detection of Fosfomycin-resistant strains in canine and feline samples indicates possible dissemination of these strains among humans, pets, and the environment, reinforced by other factors. Concerning the origin, the species, and the resistance patterns of the related bacteria, useful conclusions were drawn, about the presence, the spreading, and possibly the causes of Fosfomycin resistance among companion animals and between them and their environment. Fosfomycin is an old antibacterial agent, which is currently used mainly in human medicine, in uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infections (UTIs). The purpose of this review is to investigate the presence and the characteristics of Fosfomycin resistance in bacteria isolated from canine or feline samples, estimate the possible causes of the dissemination of associated strains in pets, and underline the requirements of prospective relevant studies. Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews (PRISMA) guidelines were used for the search of current literature in two databases. A total of 33 articles were finally included in the review. Relevant data were tracked down, assembled, and compared. Referring to the geographical distribution, Northeast Asia was the main area of origin of the studies. E. coli was the predominant species detected, followed by other Enterobacteriaceae, Staphylococci, and Pseudomonas spp. FosA and fosA3 were the more frequently encountered Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARGs) in the related Gram-negative isolates, while fosB was regularly encountered in Gram-positive ones. The majority of the strains were multidrug-resistant (MDR) and co-carried resistance genes against several classes of antibiotics and especially beta-Lactams, such as bla(CTX-M) and mecA. These results demonstrate the fact that the cause of the spreading of Fosfomycin-resistant bacteria among pets could be the extended use of other antibacterial agents, that promote the prevalence of MDR, epidemic strains among an animal population. Through the circulation of these strains into a community, a public health issue could arise. Further research is essential though, for the comprehensive consideration of the issue, as the current data are limited.",,10.3390/vetsci10050337,Animals;Fosfomycin;Dogs;Animal Shells;Cats;Bacteria,NA,,fosfomycin resistance in bacteria isolated from companion animals dogs and cats

The research on atmospheric microplastics (AMPs) started later than that on the MPs in soil and water, but AMPs' potential environmental impacts are explored in an even wider range. Based on the literatures on AMPs since 2015 as well as those about MPs in water and soil, this paper systematically reviews the distribution, source, transport of AMPS and the environmental and ecological impacts of AMPs. The results show that AMPs are distributed in global atmosphere, and have been detected in the atmosphere of urban, suburban, remote areas and indoor air. The concentrations of AMPs were detected in a range 2 to 77000 n m(-2) d(-1) or 0 to 1583 n m(-3). The distribution characteristics of MPs in atmosphere are affected by environmental factors such as indoor and outdoor environment, underlying surface type and airflow, etc. In general, the concentration and the diversity of AMPs' shape and composition are higher in the places near to MPs the source, but the wind, precipitation and even local animals could reshape the characters of AMPs. The sources of AMPs are mainly the production, use and recycling processes of plastic products, as well as land and sea where MPs accumulated. Studies also showed that abrasion of vehicle tires and the use of synthetic textile are major sources. What's noteworthy is that the COVID-19 pandemic has made masks as necessities of life, which indirectly exacerbated the pollution of AMPs. The transport of MPs can occur in atmospheric environment, such as suspension, deposition and diffusion, and is affected by the morphology of MPs, wind direction, precipitation and other atmospheric factors. The diffusion of MPs in atmosphere, also known as atmospheric transport, is an important part of the global plastic cycle. AMPs' transport path is mostly studied of Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) by conducting backward trajectory simulation, and their transport volume is estimated mainly through deposition and aerodynamic model. In addition, AMPs have unique physical and chemical properties, which can affect regional atmospheric environmental quality, change regional and global climate. It could also adsorb heavy metals, organic pollutants and harmful microorganisms during transport, resulting in greater health risks to human. Also, AMPs could affect atmospheric ecosystems through food chains and providing microbial niches, and alter structure and functions of terrestrial forest and water ecosystems through deposition. There are still some unsolved scientific and technical questions. Due to the lack of standardized sampling and identification means, the past research methods on AMPs are different on sampling and physical analysis, which make information comparison difficult. The observations of AMPs' environmental behaviors, the atmospheric transport, source attribution and trans-regional effects of AMPs are still limited. Therefore, some conclusions from laboratory researches cannot fully explain the uncertainty of in natural environment. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on AMPs should focus on standardization of research methods, the establishment of source list, transport mechanism and environmental and ecological impacts. It is necessary for the study of AMPs to establish a set of scientifically credible and technically feasible monitoring techniques as well. Because AMPs could be transported to different ecosystems and could enter the human body through a variety of ways, it is urgent to study the physiological and ecological status of human body and ecosystems which are continuously exposed to AMPs pollution.",,10.1360/TB-2021-1236,,NA,,distribution and transport of atmospheric microplastics and the environmental impacts a review

Despite ongoing research efforts, the impact of PS-MPs on mammalian behavior and the mechanisms driving these effects remain incompletely elucidated. Consequently, effective strategies for prevention have yet to be developed. To fill these gaps, C57BL/6 mice were orally administered with 5 \& mu;m PS-MPs for 28 consecutive days in this study. The open-field test and the elevated plus-maze test were performed to evaluate the anxiety-like behavior, 16S rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics analysis were used to detect the changes of gut microbiota and serum metabolites. Our results indicated that PS-MPs exposure activated hippocampal inflammation and induced anxiety-like behavior in mice. Meanwhile, PS-MPs disturbed the gut microbiota, impaired the intestinal barrier, and aroused peripheral inflammation. Specifically, PS-MPs increased the abundance of pathogenic microbiota Tuzzerella, while lowered the abundance of probiotics Faecalibaculum and Akkermansia. Interestingly, eliminating the gut microbiota protected against the deleterious effects of PS-MPs on intestinal barrier integrity, reduced the levels of peripheral inflammatory cytokines, and ameliorated anxiety-like behavior.

Zinc (Zn), copper (Cu), nickel (Ni), and lead (Pb)were the metals examined. Soil analysis also was carried out for the same elements. The tissues and bones of the fishes were separated before further analysis was made. Drying process technique was used to determine the moisture content for all samples at 80 ? for 24 hours. Water content ranged between 70 \& 77\%. Triplicate samples were evaluated by using Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer (AAS) to find out heavy metals concentration. Oven and Teflon beakers were used to fully digest all solid samples at 120 ? for 3 hours. Highest readings of Zn, Ni and Pb were found in the fish bone for the samples collected from both mentioned locations. However, different pattern was noticed for Cu where higher values were found in the tissues for the same samples. Values of Pb in the tissues were higher than the acceptable value in edible fish by Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO); 1 ppm and Malaysian Food Act (MFR) \& World Health Organization (WHO); 2 ppm, whereas values of Cu, Zn were in the acceptable range set by the same organizations. No values recommended for Ni by MFR. In general heavy metals in the bones and tissues from both locations can be sorted in descending order as follows; Pb > Zn > Cu > Ni. Soil samples collected from both locations showed different pattern where high concentration was found for Zn followed by Pb then Cu and Ni.

Degradation of insecticide fenobucarb in the paddy soil-water system was carried out by surface soil collected from paddy rice in the Hue province of Vietnam. Experiments were conducted using a batch technique, the fenobucarb-spiked paddy soils were shaken end-over-end with solutions of pH 7, pH 9, 25 mg L-1 DOC, and 1 critical micelle (cmc) sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). After each period (24, 48, 72, horizontal ellipsis 144 hours), the soil solutions were separated into the aliquot and the solid phase to analyze fenobucarb and intermediate metabolic products 2-sec-butyl phenol. The decrease of fenobucarb and the appearance of (2-sec-butyl-phenol) were the result of hydrolysis and biodegradation by fenobucarb-acclimatized microorganisms that were capable of degrading fenobucarb in the paddy soil. The degradation of fenobucarb in both the soil and water phases in the paddy soil-water system was enhanced in the experiment with pH 7, followed by those with pH 9, 25 mg L-1 DOC, and 1 cmc SDS. With pH 9, in addition to decomposition by bacteria present in the soil, fenobucarb was hydrolyzed under basic conditions. The presence of 25 mg L-1 DOC and 1 cmc SDS in the aqueous solution increased desorption and microbial activity in the soil and increased the biodegradation efficiency of fenobucarb in the paddy soil-water system. However, the degradation of fenobucarb in the 1 cmc SDS solution was inhibited because SDS solution may be preferentially utilized by microorganisms, and fenobucarb would have a competitive effect with SDS. Irrigation water for paddy fields often receives untreated domestic and industrial wastewater that may contain multiple compounds such as DOC and SDS.

For environmental epidemiological studies, measuring the metallic components of PM2.5 collected by personal samplers and quartz fiber filters (QFF) has two key advantages: reducing exposure misclassification and enabling analyses of multiple (organic and inorganic) components on a single filter. We developed a sensitive, low-sample-consumption method to quantify the metallic components of PM2.5 collected on QFFs using micro-synchrotron radiation Xray fluorescence (mu-SRXRF). Teflon filter is used here as a reference to test the substrate applicability of QFF. This method requires only a 5-mm-diameter portion of a QFF and can simultaneously quantify 15 metals with atomic numbers Z = 19-34 (i.e., K-Se, excluding Sc). The analysis time for each sample was 120-360 s, and the method detection limits were 0.04-36.6 ng/m3. We validated this method by performing cross-comparisons with two external methods: offline inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and online X-ray fluorescence (XRF). The slopes of the linear fits between the mu-SRXRF and offline ICP-MS methods varied from 0.40 to 1, with R2 values ranging from 0.62 to 0.98. The slopes of the linear fits between the mu-SRXRF and online XRF methods were between 0.29 and 0.89, with R2 values ranging from 0.39 to 0.80. We applied the proposed method to analyze 391 personal PM2.5 samples collected in an epidemiological study conducted in urban Beijing. By comparing the results with the ambient concentrations from a fixed monitoring site, we found that the con-centrations of some metallic components in personal PM2.5 samples were significantly different from those in the corresponding fixed-site samples, with up to an order of magnitude difference. Because personal sampling can reduce the potential for exposure misclassifications, the high-resolution temporal analysis of metallic compo-nents in personal samples using the mu-SRXRF method could be a useful approach for exploring the health risks and identifying the sources of metallic components of PM2.5.",,10.1016/j.atmosenv.2023.120205,Aerosols,NA,,quantifying metallic components in aerosol filter samples using microsynchrotron radiation xray fluorescence with quartz filter as an example

The clinical features of PCOS include hyperandrogenemia and polycystic ovarian changes. Bailing capsule (BL), a proprietary Chinese medicine that contains fermented Cordyceps sinensis powder, has been applied to treat PCOS. However, the specific active ingredients of BL and its mechanisms of action are yet to be elucidated.MethodsInitially, the effectiveness of BL on PCOS model mice was evaluated. Subsequently, the active ingredients of BL were searched in the TCMSP and TCM Systems Pharmacology databases, and their targets were predicted using Swiss Target Prediction and SEA databases. Furthermore, the GEO gene database was used to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) related to PCOS. Data from Gene Card, OMIM, DDT, and Drugbank databases were then combined to establish a PCOS disease gene library. Cross targets were imported into the STRING database to construct a protein-protein interaction network. In addition, GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analyses were performed using Metascape and DAVID databases and visualized using Cytoscape software and R 4.2.3. The core targets were docked with SYBYL-X software, and their expressions in PCOS mice were further verified using qPCR.ResultsThe core active ingredients of BL were identified to be linoleyl acetate, cholesteryl palmitate, arachidonic acid, among others. Microarray data sets from four groups containing disease and normal samples were obtained from the GEO database. A total of 491 DEGs and 106 drug-disease cross genes were selected. Estrous cycle and ovarian lesions were found to be improved in PCOS model mice following BL treatment. While the levels of testosterone, progesterone, and prolactin decreased, that of estradiol increased. qPCR findings indicated that the expressions of JAK2, PPARG, PI3K, and AKT1 were upregulated, whereas those of ESR1 and IRS1 were downregulated in PCOS model mice. After the administration of BL, the expressions of associated genes were regulated. This study demonstrated that BL exerted anti-PCOS effects via PIK3CA, ESR1, AKT, PPARG, and IRS1 targets affecting PI3K-Akt signaling pathways.DiscussionThis research clarified the multicomponent, multitarget, and multichannel action of BL and provided a theoretical reference for further investigations on its pharmacological basis and molecular mechanisms against PCOS.",,10.1186/s12906-023-04280-6,Computational Biology;Ovary;Capsules;Polycystic Ovary Syndrome,NA,,integrated bioinformatics and network pharmacology to explore the therapeutic target and molecular mechanisms of bailing capsule on polycystic ovary syndrome

Sixteen EP and their corresponding NP were excised from the brain-dead voluntary organ donors with no clinical history of low back pain, and 12 herniated and 8 degenerated NP tissues isolated from the patients undergoing spinal surgery were subjected to study the alteration in the microbial diversity. Objective(s)To understand in normal IVD, whether the colonization of bacteria to the NP is through the EP in discs with intact annulus fibrosus. To identify significantly differing microbial population(s) between normal and diseased IVD (NP). Background of the studyThere is increasing evidence for subclinical infection by fastidious low, growing bacteria to be a cause of disc degeneration. Although the presence of bacteria in NP has been reported well in literature, the source of bacteria is not clearly proved as the disc is avascular in healthy condition. Documentation of similar bacterial populations in the EP and NP may add proof that bacterial inoculation of NP occurs via the EP. Materials and methodsSixteen EP and their corresponding NP excised from brain-dead voluntary organ donors with no history of back pain and 20 diseased discs collected from patients undergoing microdiscectomy/fusion surgery were used for profiling microbiome through 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing using primers specific for V1-V9 hypervariable regions. Changes in bacterial diversity and abundance were analysed to identify the key microbial populations in normal IVD NP and EP tissues and those significantly altered in diseased IVD (NP). ResultsNP and EP shared a similar spectrum of microbiome but with varying abundance. The five dominant phyla identified were Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, OD1, and Bacteroidetes. Proteobacteria was found to be the most abundant phyla in both NP (62\%) and EP (53\%) of the normal IVD. This was followed by Firmicutes (16\%), Actinobacteriota (11\%), OD1 (Parcubacteria) (7.6\%), and Bacteroidetes (2\%) in NP and Firmicutes (23.4\%), OD1 (Parcubacteria) (17.6\%), Actinobacteriota (2.8\%), and Bacteroidetes (2.6\%) in EP, respectively. Under diseased conditions, Proteobacteria (68\%) was dominant when compared with other phyla. However, there was no significant difference in the abundance of Proteobacteria between the normal and diseased discs. Interestingly, the other dominant phyla such as Firmicutes (Normal-NP: 16.2\%; Diseased-NP: 4.02\%) and Actinobacteria (Normal-NP: 11\%; Diseased-NP: 0.99\%) showed a significant reduction in degenerated discs. To understand the key microbial populations that are significantly altered during disease, correlation analysis was performed among the three phyla, which revealed a negative correlation in the ratio of Actinobacteria + Firmicutes vs. Proteobacteria (p = 0.001) in DD. ConclusionResults of our study clearly demonstrated a similar bacterial diversity but with varying abundance between the EP and NP, suggesting the existence of the endplate-nucleus pulposus axis in the normal IVD microbiome. Further, our results have indicated that the changes in the abundance of Actinobacteria + Firmicutes vs. Proteobacteria during DDD need further investigation.",,10.3389/fcvm.2022.927652,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Intervertebral Disc,NA,,comparative metagenomic analysis of human intervertebral disc nucleus pulposus and cartilaginous end plates

In this review, we systematically assessed the occurrence of PFAA precursors in agricultural soils, taking into account their sources and biodegradation pathways. In addition, we summarized the findings of the relevant literature on the uptake and biotransformation of PFAA precursors by agricultural plants. The applications of biosolids/composts and pesticides are the main sources of PFAA precursors in agricultural soils. The physicochemical properties of PFAA precursors, soil organic carbon (SOC) contents, and plant species are the key factors influencing plant root uptakes of PFAA precursors from soils.

Seven studies included MetS, 15 studies for diabetes, and one study included both outcomes. It was found that PCBs may not be a risk factor for MetS, but their high heterogeneity indicates that they are under-represented. In addition, our results showed that total PCBs might be a protective factor against diabetes. In the whole blood subgroup, which can reflect the accumulation of more than one body load, heterogeneity was reduced, and its OR value suggested that PCBs increased the risk of MetS in the whole blood biomaterial. DL-PCBs were positively associated with MetS and diabetes, while NDL-PCBs were negatively associated with diabetes. In the subgroup analysis of PCBs homologs, DL-PCB-126 and DL-PCB-118 were risk factors for MetS and diabetes, respectively. In addition, PCB153 and 180 showed a dose-response relationship between them and diabetes mellitus, respectively. The results of total analysis of MetS and diabetes mellitus and subgroup analysis of PCBs were mixed, and this reason might be attributed to the different mechanisms of action and effect sizes of different PCBs, so based on subgroup results and in vivo and in vitro experiments, we considered PCBs to be a risk factor for MetS and diabetes.

Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17. 1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9].

Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow. Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience. When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life. Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify. PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis.

Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients. Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum. In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol.

Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life.

A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback.

Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions.

Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas. Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury.

Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas. Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester.

Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas. Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR.

While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas. Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries. Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature.

As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas. Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries. Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18].

While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas. Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries. Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4].

Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas. Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries. Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally.

Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas. Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries. Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35].

Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries. Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms.

Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries. Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5].

Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3].

Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17]. This highlights simple behavioral modifications during recovery can be protective against PUR. Integration of these findings to a patient's postpartum care, with the addition of patient education on good bladder hygiene, are simple interventions that may help prevent bladder dysfunction.Utilization of a standardized protocol such as that presented in Nutaitis et al.{[}3] (Fig. 1) would therefore integrate evidence-based recommendations into a regimented postpartum bladder protocol. The protocol recommends measuring the first two spontaneous voids after delivery and/or catheter removal to ensure appropriate bladder emptying. Additionally, the protocol highlights when and how PVRs should be performed and methods of bladder rest if PUR is diagnosed. Further testing, including active void trials, is also recommended to ensure a patient's PUR has resolved. This testing can be broadly utilized in both the inpatient and outpatient setting if a patient's symptoms do not resolve while admitted. Lastly, methods of outpatient management are suggested to include both ISC and indwelling catheter after educated patient shared decision making. As the majority of PUR cases resolve within 72 h, the protocol is best integrated into postpartum care units and its algorithmic nature makes it easy to follow.Postpartum bladder management protocol.Given only 17.1\% of surveyed Obstetrics and Gynecology residents reported receiving formal PUR training, the largest area for improvement is provider education {[}18]. Formal education increased the likelihood that trainees were able to identify concerning clinical scenarios suggestive of PUR. An additional auditing study found nurses overall had minimal training on identification and management of PUR {[}19]. This study audited criteria such as encouraging regular voids intrapartum, recording strict fluid input and output both in the intrapartum and postpartum period, and ensuring individuals had two adequate spontaneous voids after delivery. After educational strategies were implemented, the study found reductions in both PUR incidence and the time to void after delivery {[}19]. Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.Purpose of reviewThe aim of this study was to describe the common postpartum urinary sequelae including urinary retention and incontinence, and to summarize the management of these conditions.Despite the high frequency of urinary disorders in obstetrics, screening and management protocols are rarely utilized by providers. Large variation exists in the literature regarding assessment of postpartum urinary retention, values of postvoid residuals and management of indwelling catheters in the immediate postpartum population. Recent expert guidance outlines a strategy for managing this condition.Research also highlights that screening for peripartum urinary incontinence is not a routine practice. The diagnosis is made more challenging by the fact that patients commonly understate and over-normalize their symptoms. Emerging studies have found that pelvic floor muscle training is cost-effective, preventive, and may improve symptoms in the postpartum setting.Increased awareness of urinary disorders in pregnancy and postpartum is imperative for appropriate diagnosis and management. Instituting standardized voiding protocols postpartum will allow providers to avoid undiagnosed postpartum urinary retention and its repercussions. Improved screening and education regarding urinary incontinence in the peripartum is important for early management, such as pelvic floor muscle training, and improved quality of life.Papers of particular interest, published within the annual period of review, have been highlighted as:While society places a large emphasis on antepartum obstetrical care, there continues to be insufficient patient education and awareness about the fourth trimester, or the first 12 weeks after giving birth, including the many short and long-term sequalae associated with delivery. Notably, education about peripartum pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is often ignored during pregnancy, with studies finding that patients between the ages of 19 and 39 years were the least proficient regarding the topic {[}1]. PFDs are associated with decreased quality of life, psychological strain and a sense of patient embarrassment {[}2]. Out of the three domains of PFDs, urinary symptom distress is the most common in obstetrics, with 41.8\% of patients reporting these issues {[}2]. These symptoms may present at opposite ends of the spectrum during the postpartum period with urinary retention and urinary incontinence. As such, the purpose of this article is to educate providers on how to prevent, recognize and manage postpartum urinary sequelae. no caption availableGenitourinary system changes associated with pregnancy begin in the first trimester. The underlying mechanisms contributing to these dynamic changes are multifaceted. Elevation in the level of progesterone may lead to decreased urethral pressures, relaxation of urinary system smooth muscle and impaired detrusor contractility {[}3]. Renal changes include an increase in glomerular filtration rates and dilation of the ureters, resulting in increased urine production and functional bladder volumes. The enlarging gravid uterus contributes to bladder compression and can lead to urinary frequency, urgency and incontinence {[}2,4]. Together, these genitourinary system changes make bladder control issues a common phenomenon antepartum, and for some, persistent postpartum.Aspects of the birthing process are thought to predispose some individuals to the development of urinary disorders as well. Mechanical forces from pushing cause anatomical changes with inevitable bladder descent and compression. This may result in cellular injury, causing neurogenic dysfunction and consequently diminished sensation associated with bladder filling {[}5]. Lack of bladder sensation may lead to a vicious cycle where further overdistention of the bladder may in turn result in continued damage and reduced detrusor contractility.Epidurals and other forms of neuraxial anesthesia may also predispose individuals to postpartum voiding dysfunction due to disruption of afferent bladder innervations {[}6]. This disruption consequently interferes with the ability of the pontine micturition center to signal for detrusor muscle contraction and urethral sphincter relaxation {[}7].Traumatic birth processes such as perineal edema, advanced lacerations and hematomas may cause mechanical bladder outlet obstruction {[}6]. Other sources of birth trauma may involve levator ani muscle avulsion and nerve injury involving the pelvic, hypogastric and pudendal nerves which can affect sensation and continence {[}3,8]. Obstetric anal sphincter injuries and other lacerations may also impair reflexive and voluntary relaxation of the urethrae sphincter and periurethral muscles {[}3]. While these outcomes may be identified during a patient's postpartum care, their physiologic consequences also predispose patients to postpartum urinary retention (PUR) and urinary dysfunction, a diagnosis that may be more nuanced to identify.PUR is a relatively common postpartum phenomenon with a wide range of incidence in the literature, ranging from 1.5 to 45\% {[}9]. This large variance is likely due to a variety of reasons, including most importantly the lack of standardized definitions and management protocols for PUR. Consequently, only approximately 30\% of United States labor and delivery institutions have an established protocol for PUR evaluation and management, which thereby contributes to a wide variation in PUR recognition clinically {[}3].There are three main subtypes of PUR, outlined in Table 1. Individuals with PUR may present with symptoms similar to nonobstetric postoperative patients, including low urine output, frequency, dysuria, suprapubic fullness or hesitancy to void {[}3]. In an obstetric-specific clinical scenario, additional findings may include displaced fundal exams (both in height and in lateral displacement) and increased vaginal bleeding due to impaired ability for the uterus to contract down {[}3]. As implied by the definition of covert PUR, individuals may also be asymptomatic. A multitude of risk factors described in Table 2 may predispose certain individuals to PUR. As such, PUR may go undiagnosed if proper screening protocols are not in place.Subtypes of postpartum urinary retentionPUR, postpartum urinary retention.Risk factors for postpartum urinary retention {[}5,6,9,10]ISC, intermittent straight catheterization; OASIS, obstetric anal sphincter injuries.Importantly, mismanaged PUR may lead to rare long-term repercussions, including noncontractile fibrosis of the detrusor muscle and bladder rupture {[}3]. Previous research has shown that PUR may take up to 42 days to resolve, with some studies also reporting prolonged voiding dysfunction at intervals 1-3 years after delivery {[}8]. These findings stress the importance of both creating and utilizing a set of standardized recommendations to manage PUR.Early diagnosis is essential in PUR management. The amount of variation in the literature regarding PUR likely leads to decreased awareness and impaired diagnosis. While the previously described definitions in Table 1 are the most common established in the literature, it is notable that there is variance in the specific postvoid residual (PVR) cut-offs {[}5,10]. The most common PVR cut-off remains 150 ml, without consequent adverse outcomes with using this volume {[}11]. Given that values above 200 ml may reflect inadequate bladder emptying and values less than 100 ml may be a normal variant, 150 ml should remain the standard abnormal PVR cut-off.The route of measurement of PVRs varies greatly in the literature. A systemic review of PUR found the majority of studies used transabdominal ultrasounds or ultrasonic measurement devices (commonly known as a bladder scanner) to measure PVR rather than intermittent self-catheterization (ISC) {[}12]. While bladder scanners may be convenient and easy to use, there is evidence these devices in the postpartum period may have low accuracy with +/- 15\% error, leading to discrepancies averaging 42.7 ml between measuring modalities {[}12,13]. Alternatively, transabdominal ultrasound is costly, time-consuming and requires a qualified ultrasonographer {[}14]. Creation of a stepwise standardized protocol including first using bladder scanners and then performing ISC if an elevated PVR is identified may therefore prevent unnecessary invasive testing.There is also significant variation of indwelling catheter usage following delivery. A review found in patients who underwent cesarean section, removal of urinary catheters greater than 24 h postoperatively decreased the risk of urinary retention, while removal less than 6 h postoperatively was associated with decreased risk of UTI and decreased the length to first ambulation {[}15]. Conversely, a randomized controlled trial found patients diagnosed with PUR had significant shorter timeframes to PUR resolution when managed with ISC, with no difference in UTI rates or length of hospital stay between the two management modalities {[}16]. A study comparing bedpan use versus mobilizing to the toilet postpartum found significantly higher micturition rates in individuals who used the toilet versus the bedpan {[}17].

Taken together, healthcare provider education on PUR is effective for properly identifying and managing abnormal voiding patterns and is important for improving patient outcomes.Active patient management remains the most important strategy for PUR management. However, bethanechol is FDA approved for the PUR treatment {[}20]. Bethanechol acts by activating bladder muscarinic receptors, which increases detrusor muscle tone to aid in bladder emptying {[}20]. However, this agent has notable cardiac, pulmonary and gastrointestinal adverse effects which limit broad application. Additionally, there is no established literature regarding the usage of bethanechol while breastfeeding; if used, infants should be monitored for cholinergic excess with symptoms such as diarrhea, lacrimation and excessive urination {[}21]. As such, nonpharmacologic management of PUR should be prioritized.Lastly, studies have also examined the use of acupuncture and the act of remedying imbalances of Qi, a concept of the vital force of life. Recent small studies involving acupuncture postpartum and auricular acupressure are protective against PUR {[}22,23].Urinary incontinence, encompassing stress, urge and mixed subtypes, is known to have a significant impact on quality of life {[}24]. It is estimated to impact 32-64\% of pregnancies and 15-30\% of individuals in the first year postpartum {[}25]. Risk factors for postpartum urinary incontinence include protracted second stage of labor, operative vaginal delivery, increased maternal parity, and larger fetal head circumference {[}4]. While physiologic factors such as intra-abdominal pressure from a gravid uterus may resolve with delivery, limited research exists regarding prevention and management of postpartum urinary incontinence.Additionally, surveys have shown that a majority of patients who report stress urinary incontinence (SUI) antepartum and 8 weeks postpartum had persistent symptoms 1 year postpartum, highlighting the symptom's high positive predictive value {[}26]. With knowledge that pregnancy is a strong risk factor for urinary incontinence and development of pregnancy urinary incontinence is strongly associated with persistent symptoms, improved management of postpartum urinary incontinence is necessary to reduce the burden it has on patients.Similar to PUR, postpartum urinary incontinence lacks standardized identification antepartum and postpartum. Studies have found that providers do not routinely screen for PFD or urinary incontinence complaints in the postpartum period {[}9]. Additionally, there is no postpartum-specific screening tool established {[}2,27,28]. Simple questions such as ``Do you experience bothersome leakage of urine?{''} may effectively screen patients and allow providers to avoid over-normalization of peripartum urinary incontinence {[}9]. This education helps prevent the patient perception that their urinary incontinence will improve spontaneously with time, an outcome which not every patient may experience {[}27].Lastly, frequent screening may also lead to improved outcomes through earlier diagnosis of urinary incontinence.In general, pregnancy-related urinary incontinence management should focus on conservative efforts including behavioral modifications and pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT) with the option of including biofeedback. Behavioral modifications include maintaining appropriate bladder hygiene with limited bladder irritants and timed voids.Following education on behavioral modifications, PFMT is a first-line recommendation for management of stress and mixed urinary incontinence that remains well tolerated and effective in pregnant and postpartum patients {[}24]. A Cochrane review of 46 studies highlighted that early, structured antenatal PFMT reduced the risk of late pregnancy and postpartum urinary incontinence between 3 and 6 months postpartum in patients who were continent prior to pregnancy {[}29]. The ability for PFMT to both prevent and treat urinary incontinence may also be cost-effective; an additional meta-analysis found that antenatal PFMT continued to have risk-reduction for postnatal urinary incontinence {[}30]. This factor is important to consider while patients seek PFMT during their peripartum period, as many individuals must consider the cost of attending additional appointments antenatally. Studies have also found additional benefits of a simple antepartum PFMT regimen suggested by Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31] as listed in Table 3, including improved sexual satisfaction, prevention anal insufficiency and also improving labor and delivery outcomes given overall increased strength and control of the pelvic floor musculature.Minimum PFMT exercise prescriptionPreviously published in Woodley and Hay-Smith {[}31].Pessaries and other vaginal inserts for SUI are additional well tolerated options for pregnant and postpartum patients. Postpartum-specific pessaries have shown improvement in urinary incontinence symptoms at both 3 and 6-month postpartum {[}32]. Specific postpartum pessaries such as the Restifem have been utilized as early as 6 weeks postpartum {[}32]. However, earlier use in a symptomatic patient could be considered for patients with minimal or no vaginal tearing from the obstetric delivery (including cesarean section) and would be at the discretion of the obstetric provider. While pharmacologic therapies such as antimuscarinics, beta-3 adrenergics and onabotulinum toxin are an option for overactive bladder, they are contraindicated if a patient is breastfeeding, limiting their clinical utility for refractory symptoms postpartum. Lastly, surgical procedures for significant, bothersome SUI are typically deferred until a patient heals completely from pregnancy, traditionally not before 6 months postpartum.In sum, maternal care providers should implement screening for urinary incontinence and offer either education on self-taught PFMT regimens or referrals to physical therapists for PFMT sessions. Future considerations may utilize telemedicine or mobile applications in order to make education regarding patient-driven PFMT available at a patient's convenience.When evaluating postpartum urinary incontinence, obstetric-related vesicovaginal fistulas (VVFs) may be considered. Although rare in developed countries, VVFs may occur in the setting of prolonged obstructed labor and often present 1-2 weeks after delivery {[}33]. Case reports also report a higher incidence of other genitourinary fistulas including vesicouterine fistulas in the setting of the increasing incidence of cesarean sections {[}34]. Thin lower uterine segments in conjunction with bladder adhesive disease and poor visualization of the vesicouterine flexure are likely the cause behind these rare fistulas {[}34]. Lastly, a handful of case reports have also highlighted genitourinary fistulas in the setting of uterine artery embolization for postpartum hemorrhage {[}35]. While all of these scenarios are rare, genitourinary fistulas must be considered if patients present with atypical symptoms such as continuous clear vaginal leakage. These typically can be clinically diagnosed with urine pooling in the vagina on a speculum examination; however, a double dye tampon test can be helpful if physical examination findings are equivocal. Additional imaging, such as a computed tomography (CT) urogram, is also important given the elevated incidence of concurrent vesicovaginal and ureterovaginal fistulas.Postpartum urinary dysfunction is a common sequalae during the immediate postpartum and fourth trimester periods. Simple modifications during recovery may reduce PUR risk. Using standardized PUR protocols allows for management in both the outpatient and inpatient settings and reduces the likelihood of bladder injury. Management of peripartum urinary incontinence necessitates early identification and utilization of conservative measures such as PFMT. Importantly, increased patient and provider education is imperative to raise awareness that bladder complaints should be standardly integrated in postpartum care.None.",,10.1097/GCO.0000000000000919,Postpartum Period,NA,,current opinion postpartum urinary disorders

Effectively managing these hazardous contaminants in a risk-based manner requires quantitative insights into the factors influencing the presence and fate of contaminants in the entire circular food chain. A systematic literature review was performed to gain an up-to-date overview of the known factors and their influence on the transfer and accumulation of contaminants. This review focused on the terrestrial circular primary food production system, including the pathways between waste- or byproduct-based fertilizers, soil, crops, animal feed, and farmed animals. This review revealed an imbalance in research regarding the different pathways: studies on the soil-to-crop pathway were most abundant. The factors identified can be categorized as compound-related (intrinsic) factors, such as hydrophobicity, molecular weight, and chain length, and extrinsic factors, such as soil organic matter and carbon, pH, milk yield of cows, crop age, and biomass. Quantitative data on the influence of the identified factors were limited. Most studies quantified the influence of individual factors, whereas only a few studies quantified the combined effect of multiple factors. By providing a holistic insight into the influential factors and the quantification of their influence on the fate of contaminants, this review contributes to the improvement of food safety management for chemical hazards when transitioning to a circular food system.",,10.1111/1541-4337.13324,,NA,,factors influencing the fate of chemical food safety hazards in the terrestrial circular primary food production systema comprehensive review

Many metals and toxic elements, along with poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known to induce immunomodulation and have previously been linked to increased pathogen prevalence and infectious disease severity. In this study, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) was investigated at the coast of Helgeland in northern Norway. This population is commonly infected with the parasitic nematode ``gapeworm{''} (Syngamus trachea), with a prevalence of 40-60 \% during summer months. Gapeworm induces severe respiratory disease in birds and has been previously demonstrated to decrease survival and reproductive success in wild house sparrows. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a higher exposure to pollution with PFASs, metals and other elements influences gapeworm infection in wild house sparrows. We conducted PFASs and elemental analysis on whole blood from 52 house sparrows from Helgeland, including analyses of highly toxic metals such as lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As). In addition, we studied gapeworm infection load by counting the parasite eggs in faeces from each individual. We also studied the expression of microRNA 155 (miR155) as a key regulator in the immune system. Elevated blood concentrations of Pb were found to be associated with an increased prevalence of gapeworm infection in the house sparrow. The expression of miR155 in the plasma of the house sparrow was only weakly associated with Pb. In contrast, we found relatively low PFASs concentrations in the house sparrow blood ( n-ary sumation PFASs 0.00048-354 mu g/L) and PFASs were not associated to miR155 nor infection rate.

Perfluoroalkyl exposure aberrantly modulates lipid, metabolite, and bile acid levels, increasing susceptibility to onset and severity of metabolic diseases, such as diabetes and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. To date, most studies in humans have focused on perfluoroalkyl-exposure effects in adults. In this study we aimed to show if perfluoroalkyls are present in the human fetal liver and if they have metabolic consequences for the human fetus. Methods In this cross-sectional study, human fetal livers from elective termination of pregnancies at the Aberdeen Pregnancy Counselling Service, Aberdeen, UK, were analysed by both targeted (bile acids and perfluoroalkyl substances) and combined targeted and untargeted (lipids and polar metabolites) mass spectrometry based metabolomic analyses, as well as with RNA-Seq. Only fetuses from normally progressing pregnancies (determined at ultrasound scan before termination), terminated for non-medical reasons, from women older than 16 years, fluent in English, and between 11 and 21 weeks of gestation were collected. Women exhibiting considerable emotional distress or whose fetuses had anomalies identified at ultrasound scan were excluded. Stringent bioinformatic and statistical methods such as partial correlation network analysis, linear regression, and pathway analysis were applied to this data to investigate the association of perfluoroalkyl exposure with hepatic metabolic pathways. Findings Fetuses included in this study were collected between Dec 2, 2004, and Oct 27, 2014. 78 fetuses were included in the study: all 78 fetuses were included in the metabolomics analysis (40 female and 38 male) and 57 fetuses were included in the RNA-Seq analysis (28 female and 29 male). Metabolites associated with perfluoroalkyl were identified in the fetal liver and these varied with gestational age. Conjugated bile acids were markedly positively associated with fetal age. 23 amino acids, fatty acids, and sugar derivatives in fetal livers were inversely associated with perfluoroalkyl exposure, and the bile acid glycolithocholic acid was markedly positively associated with all quantified perfluoroalkyl. Furthermore, 7 alpha-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one, a marker of bile acid synthesis rate, was strongly positively associated with perfluoroalkyl levels and was detectable as early as gestational week 12. Interpretation Our study shows direct evidence for the in utero effects of perfluoroalkyl exposure on specific key hepatic products. Our results provide evidence that perfluoroalkyl exposure, with potential future consequences, manifests in the human fetus as early as the first trimester of gestation. Furthermore, the profiles of metabolic changes resemble those observed in perinatal perfluoroalkyl exposures. Such exposures are already linked with susceptibility, initiation, progression, and exacerbation of a wide range of metabolic diseases.

Leveraging a larger set of literature searches conducted to synthesize results from longitudinal studies of potentially modifiable risk factors for childhood ADHD, we present meta-analytic results from 66 studies that examined the associations between early chemical exposures and later ADHD diagnosis or symptoms. Studies were eligible for inclusion if the chemical exposure occurred at least 6 months prior to measurement of ADHD diagnosis or symptomatology. Included papers were published between 1975 and 2019 on exposure to anesthetics (n = 5), cadmium (n = 3), hexachlorobenzene (n = 4), lead (n = 22), mercury (n = 12), organophosphates (n = 7), and polychlorinated biphenyls (n = 13). Analyses are presented for each chemical exposure by type of ADHD outcome reported (categorical vs. continuous), type of ADHD measurement (overall measures of ADHD, ADHD symptoms only, ADHD diagnosis only, inattention only, hyperactivity/impulsivity only), and timing of exposure (prenatal vs. childhood vs. cumulative), whenever at least 3 relevant effect sizes were available. Childhood lead exposure was positively associated with ADHD diagnosis and symptoms in all analyses except for the prenatal analyses (odds ratios (ORs) ranging from 1.60 to 2.62, correlation coefficients (CCs) ranging from 0.14 to 0.16). Other statistically significant associations were limited to organophosphates (CC = 0.11, 95\% confidence interval (CI): 0.03-0.19 for continuous measures of ADHD outcomes overall), polychlorinated biphenyls (CC = 0.08, 95\% CI: 0.02-0.14 for continuous measures of inattention as the outcome), and both prenatal and childhood mercury exposure (CC = 0.02, 95\% CI: 0.00-0.04 for continuous measures of ADHD outcomes overall for either exposure window). Our findings provide further support for negative impacts of prenatal and/or childhood exposure to certain chemicals and raise the possibility that primary prevention and targeted screening could prevent or mitigate ADHD symptomatology.

They can have adverse effects on the morphology, physiology, growth, and development of different organs and systems, among these bone health can be affected too. EDCs work as agonists or antagonists on hormonal receptors in hormone-sensitive cells, influence gene expression by epigenetic mechanisms, stimulate or inhibit cell maturation, and affect the synthesis and metabolism of hormones. This review aims to summarize current evidence on the effects of exposure to EDCs on bone from early gestational to birth and long-term adverse effects. Single and mixtures of endocrine-disrupting chemicals can disrupt bone structure by modifying differentiation, increasing osteoclast activity, inhibiting pre-osteoblasts differentiation into mature osteoblasts and osteocytes, inducing changes in signaling pathways downstream of receptors, and ultimately remodeling and modifying the equilibrium between bone resorption and formation leading to increased bone resorption, morphological, and functional changes in bone maturation. EDCs can affect the IGF system, alkaline phosphatase, and osteocalcin gene expression. Findings are relative to both in vitro and in vivo studies. Studies have shown that prenatal exposure to EDCs leads to growth retardation, delayed ossification, and changes in bone length and size and in bone geometry with a lowering of bone mineral density and area-adjusted bone mineral content. Current knowledge on bone health, growth, mineral content, and development from molecular to clinical findings highlights how endocrine-disrupting chemicals can negatively affect these processes.

There is, however, no comprehensive, regulatory, post-market monitoring for human health effects of plastic-associated chemicals or particles and it is unclear how many of these have been investigated for effects in humans, and therefore what the knowledge gaps are. Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of peer-reviewed human studies investigating the potential effects of exposure to plastic-associated particles/chemicals on health to identify research gaps and provide recommendations for future research and regulation policy. Methods: Medline and Embase databases were used to identify peer-reviewed primary human studies published in English from Jan 1960 - Jan 2022 that investigated relationships between exposures to included plasticassociated particles/chemicals measured and detected in bio-samples and human health outcomes. Plasticassociated particles/chemicals included are: micro and nanoplastics, due to their widespread occurrence and potential for human exposure; polymers, the main building blocks of plastic; plasticizers and flame retardants, the two most common types of plastic additives with the highest concentration ranges in plastic materials; and bisphenols and per- or polyfluoroalkyl substances, two chemical classes of known health concern that are common in plastics. We extracted metadata on the population and study characteristics (country, intergenerational, sex, age, general/special exposure risk status, study design), exposure (plastic-associated particle/ chemical, multiple exposures), and health outcome measures (biochemical, physiological, and/or clinical), from which we produced the interactive database `Plastic Health Map' and a narrative summary. Results: We identified 100,949 unique articles, of which 3,587 met our inclusion criteria and were used to create a systematic evidence map. The Plastic Health Map with extracted metadata from included studies are freely available at https://osf.io/fhw7d/ and summary tables, plots and overall observations are included in this report. Conclusions: We present the first evidence map compiling human health research on a wide range of plasticassociated chemicals from several different chemical classes, in order to provide stakeholders, including researchers, regulators, and concerned individuals, with an efficient way to access published literature on the matter and determine knowledge gaps. We also provide examples of data clusters to facilitate systematic reviews and research gaps to help direct future research efforts.

Most of the reviewed studies on exposure to PAHs and their metabolites with gestational age and preterm birth (seven studies) reported no statistically significant as-sociation. Eight studies were eligible for our meta-analysis. Results of the meta-analysis indicated that higher levels of maternal urinary 1-OHP was associated with lower birth weight, birth length and head circumference and a higher risk of low birth weight (LBW). However, these associations were not statistically significant. Similarly, the combined association between maternal urinary 1-OHP and newborn's Ponderal index (PI) and Cephalization index were not statistically significant. Overall, our systematic review and meta-analysis suggested a potential adverse impact of exposure to PAHs on LBW, HC, and CC; however, further studies are required to be able to draw concrete conclusions on such associations.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166922,"Hydrocarbons, Aromatic",NA,,the association between exposure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and birth outcomes a systematic review and metaanalysis of observational studies

Yet the association between prenatal pesticide exposure and risk of preterm birth remains inconclusive. Objectives: To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of human observational studies using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) framework to explore the association of per ten-fold increase of pesticide concentrations in maternal biological samples during pregnancy with risk of preterm birth and length of gestational age at birth. Data source: Five English (PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science and Scopus) and 3 Chinese databases (China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI), Wanfang Data, and Chinese Biomedical Literature Database (CBM)) were searched till Jan 18th, 2023. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: To be included, pesticide exposure should be measured in maternal biological samples during pregnancy and in log-transformed forms. The primary outcome was preterm birth and the secondary outcome was gestational age at birth. Study appraisal, synthesis methods and confidence assessment: Quality of studies was evaluated using OHAT Risk of Bias Tool. Evidence was quantitatively synthesized with Correlated and Hierarchical Effects (CHE) model. The confidence rating in the body of evidence was done using OHAT. Results: A total of 21 studies reported by 18 papers were included, with 7 studies for preterm birth and 19 for gestational age at birth. The meta-analysis found a ten-fold increase of pesticide concentrations was potentially associated with risk of preterm birth (pooled OR = 1.28; 95\%CI: 0.93, 1.78) and shortened gestational age at birth (beta = -0.10; 95\%CI: -0.21, 0.01). Sampling biospecimens in different trimesters was identified as a potential modifier in the association between pesticide exposure and length of gestational age (F = 2.77, P < 0.05). For studies that collected samples at any time during pregnancy, pesticide exposure was found to be associated with shortened length of gestational age (beta = -0.43; 95\%CI: -0.81, -0.06). The confidence rating in the body of evidence was ``moderate{''} and ``very low{''} for preterm birth and gestational age at birth, respectively. Conclusion: Our result suggested moderate evidence of an association between pesticide exposure and higher risk of preterm birth. Yet more studies are still needed with larger sample size and careful considerations of confounders and accuracy of outcome measurements.

Three classes of ePFASs, namely chlorinated polyfluoroalkylether sulfonic acids, hexafluoropropylene oxide homologues and short-chain perfluoroalkyl acids attracted the most attention. It is, therefore, the goal of this review to systematically and critically analyse the toxicity and toxicological mechanisms of these ePFASs based on the papers published between 2017 and 2022. The review summarized the main findings from both in vivo and in vitro studies, covering the hepatotoxicity of ePFASs and their interference with the endocrine system, including reproductive, developmental and thyroid toxicity. It also summarized the changes in gene expression in the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis and hypothalamic-pituitary-gonad axis of the model organisms after ePFASs exposure. The changes in gene expression in vitro and in vivo provide a clearer understanding of the toxicological mechanisms of ePFASs interference on hormonal levels (i.e., estradiol, testosterone, and thyroid hormones), developmental disturbance (e.g., swim bladder dysfunction) and lipid metabolism disruption (e.g., lipid droplet accumulation and hepatomegaly).

This systematic review of epidemiological studies examined the association between maternal exposure to EDCs during pregnancy and the risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in the offspring.Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar from inception to November 17, 2022, for studies investigating the association between prenatal exposure to EDCs and outcomes related to ASD. Two independent reviewers screened studies for eligibility, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. The review was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023389386).Results: We included 27 observational studies assessing prenatal exposure to phthalates (8 studies), polychlorinated biphenyls (8 studies), organophosphate pesticides (8 studies), phenols (7 studies), perfluoroalkyl substances (6 studies), organochlorine pesticides (5 studies), brominated flame retardants (3 studies), dioxins (1 study), and parabens (1 study). The number of examined children ranged from 77 to 1,556, the age at the assessment of autistic traits ranged from 3 to 14 years, and most studies assessed autistic traits using the Social Responsiveness Scale. All but one study was considered to have a low risk of bias. Overall, there was no association between maternal exposure to specific ECDs during pregnancy and the occurrence of autistic traits in offspring.Conclusions: Findings from the epidemiological studies evaluated here do not support an association between prenatal exposure to ECDs and the likelihood of autistic traits in later in life. These findings should not be interpreted as definitive evidence of the absence of neurodevelopment effects of EDCs affecting ASD risk, given the limitations of current studies such as representative exposure assessment, small sample sizes, inadequacy to assess sexually dimorphic effects, or the effects of EDC mixtures.

However, there are controversial outcomes in RRD cases involving the lower quadrants. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PPV combined air tamponade in patients with RRD compared with PPV combined gas tamponade and whether it could be a safe alternative to PPV combined gas tamponade. Methods: The PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases published until September 2022 were comprehensively searched for studies that compared PPV combined with air tamponade and gas tamponade in patients with RRD. The rate of primary treatment success, best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), and postoperative complications were extracted from the final eligible studies. The mean difference (MD) and risk ratio (RR) were calculated for continuous and dichotomous variables, respectively, with 95\% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: A total of 8 studies with 668 eyes in the air tamponade group and 944 in the gas tamponade group were included. There was no significant difference in the rate of primary treatment success between the air tamponade group and the gas tamponade group (RR = 1.00, P = 0.79). In addition, the subgroup analysis suggested that whether retinal breaks were located above or below, there was no significant difference in either rate of primary treatment success (RR = 0.99, P = 0.89; RR = 1.02, P = 0.45). There was no significant difference in mean BCVA 3 months after surgery (MD = -0.02, P = 0.50).

In the present narrative, we adopt a systematic review methodology (PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) around recent global literature (2002-2022), around moss-based passive biomonitoring approaches which might offer the regulatory authorities a complementary means to fill `gaps' in existing air quality records. Following the 4-phased search procedure under PRISMA, total of 123 documents were selected for review. A wealth of research demonstrates how passive biomonitoring, with strategic use of mosses, could become an invaluable regulatory (and research) tool to monitor atmospheric deposition patterns and help identifying the main drivers of air quality changes (e.g., anthropogenic and/or natural). Besides individual studies, we briefly reflect on the European Moss Survey, underway since 1990, which aptly showcases mosses as `naturally occurring' sensors of ambient air quality for a slew of metals (heavy and trace) and persistent organic pollutants, and help assessing spatio-temporal changes therein. To that end, we urge the global research community to conduct targeted research around various pollutant uptake mechanisms by mosses (e.g., species-specific interactions, environmental conditions, land management practices). Of late, mosses have found various environmental applications as well, such as in epidemiological investigations, identification of pollutant sources and transport mechanisms, assessment of air quality in diverse and complex urban ecosystems, and even detecting short-term changes in ambient air quality (e.g., COVID-19 Lockdown), each being critical for the authorities to develop informed and strategic regulatory measures. To that end, we review current literature and highlight to the regulatory authorities how to extend moss-based observations, by integrating them with a wide range of ecological indicators to assess regional environmental vulnerability/risk due to degrading air quality. Overall, an underlying motive behind this narrative was to broaden the current regulatory outlook and purview, to bolster and diversify existing air quality monitoring initiatives, by coupling the moss-based outputs with the traditional, sensor-based datasets, and attain improved spatial representation. However, we also make a strong case of conducting more targeted research to fill in the `gaps' in our current understanding of moss-based passive biomonitoring details, with increased case studies.",,10.1007/s10668-023-03043-0,,NA,,global ambient air quality monitoring <i>can mosses help<i> a systematic metaanalysis of literature about passive moss biomonitoring

These exposures often represent a complex mixture of different stressors, challenging the ability to delineate the mechanisms and risk factors underlying exposure-disease relationships. The use of omics measurement approaches that enable characterization of biological marker patterns provide internal indicators of molecular alterations, which could be used to identify bioeffects following exposure to a toxicant. Metabolomics is the comprehensive analysis of small molecule present in biological samples, and allows identification of potential modes of action and altered pathways by systematic measurement of metabolites. Objectives The aim of this study is to review the application of metabolomics studies for use in occupational health, with a focus on applying metabolomics for exposure monitoring and its relationship to occupational diseases. Methods PubMed, Web of Science, Embase and Scopus electronic databases were systematically searched for relevant studies published up to 2021. Results Most of reviewed studies included worker populations exposed to heavy metals such as As, Cd, Pb, Cr, Ni, Mn and organic compounds such as tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, trichloroethylene, polyfluoroalkyl, acrylamide, polyvinyl chloride. Occupational exposures were associated with changes in metabolites and pathways, and provided novel insight into the relationship between exposure and disease outcomes. The reviewed studies demonstrate that metabolomics provides a powerful ability to identify metabolic phenotypes and bioeffect of occupational exposures.

Environmental risk factors may lead to increased glucose levels and GDM, which in turn may affect not only the health of the mother but assuming hypotheses of ``fetal programming{''}, also the health of the offspring. In addition to traditional GDM risk factors, the evidence is growing that environmental influences might affect the development of GDM. We conducted a systematic review analyzing the association between several environmental health risk factors in pregnancy, including climate factors, chemicals and metals, and GDM. Methods We performed a systematic literature search in Medline (PubMed), EMBASE, CINAHL, Cochrane Library and Web of Science Core Collection databases for research articles published until March 2021. Epidemiological human and animal model studies that examined GDM as an outcome and / or glycemic outcomes and at least one environmental risk factor for GDM were included. Results Of n = 91 studies, we classified n = 28 air pollution, n = 18 persistent organic pollutants (POP), n = 11 arsenic, n = 9 phthalate n = 8 bisphenol A (BPA), n = 8 seasonality, n = 6 cadmium and n = 5 ambient temperature studies. In total, we identified two animal model studies. Whilst we found clear evidence for an association between GDM and air pollution, ambient temperature, season, cadmium, arsenic, POPs and phthalates, the findings regarding phenols were rather inconsistent. There were clear associations between adverse glycemic outcomes and air pollution, ambient temperature, season, POPs, phenols, and phthalates. Findings regarding cadmium and arsenic were heterogeneous (n = 2 publications in each case). Conclusions Environmental risk factors are important to consider in the management and prevention of GDM. In view of mechanisms of fetal programming, the environmental risk factors investigated may impair the health of mother and offspring in the short and long term.

PCBs have been of concern due to their anti/estrogen-like effects, which make them more toxic to the female reproductive system. However, there is still a lack of systematic reviews on the reproductive toxicity of PCBs in females, so the adverse effects and mechanisms of PCBs on the female reproductive system were summarized in this paper. Our findings showed that PCBs are positively associated with lower pregnancy rate, hormone disruption, miscarriage and various reproductive diseases in women. In animal experiments, PCBs can damage the structure and function of the ovaries, uterus and oviducts. Also, PCBs could produce epigenetic effects and be transferred to the offspring through the maternal placenta, causing development retardation, malformation and death of embryos, and damage to organs of multiple generations. Furthermore, the mechanisms of PCBs -induced female reproductive toxicity mainly include receptor -mediated hormone disorders, oxidative stress, apoptosis, autophagy, and epigenetic modifications. Finally, we also present some directions for future research on the reproductive toxicity of PCBs.

A meta-analysis was complementarily analysed through the literature to map out the occurrence and fate of MPs and 10 different groups of OCs. The data demonstrate that MPs (54.7\% occurrence rate) and linear alkylbenzene sulfonate surfactants (44.2\% occurrence rate) account for the highest prevalence of contaminants in biosolids. In turn, dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and phosphorus flame retardants (PFRs) have the lowest rates (<0.01\%). The occurrence of several OCs (e.g., dioxin, perand polyfluoroalkyl substances, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, pharmaceutical and personal care products, ultraviolet filters, phosphate flame retardants) in Europe appear at higher rates than in Asia and the Americas. However, MP concentrations in biosolids from Australia are reported to be 10 times higher than in America and Europe, which required more measurement data for in-depth analysis. Amongst the OC groups, brominated flame retardants exhibited exceptional sorption to biosolids with partitioning coefficients (log Kd) higher than 4. To remove these contaminants from biosolids, a wide range of technologies have been developed. Our multicriteria analysis shows that anaerobic digestion is the most mature and practical.

Despite this prevalence, limited information is available regarding its hepatotoxicity biomarkers. In this study, toxicokinetic simulations indicated that under repeated treatment, HFPO-DA in mice serum reached a steady state by the 4th day. To assess its subacute hepatic effects and identify potential biomarkers, mice were administered HFPO-DA orally at doses of 0, 0.1, 0.5, 2.5, 12.5, or 62.5 mg/kg/d for 7 d. Results revealed that the lowest observed adverse effect levels were 0.5 mg/kg/d for hepatomegaly and 2.5 mg/kg/d for hepatic injury. Serum metabolomics analysis identified 34, 58, and 118 differential metabolites in the 0.1, 0.5, and 2.5 mg/kg/d groups, respectively, compared to the control group. Based on weighted gene coexpression network analysis, eight potential hepatotoxicity-related metabolites were identified; among them, kynurenic acid (KA) in mouse serum exhibited the highest correlation with liver injury. Furthermore, liver-targeted metabolomics analysis demonstrated that HFPO-DA exposure induced metabolic migration of the kynurenine pathway from KA to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, resulting in the activation of endoplasmic reticulum stress and the nuclear factor kappa-B signaling pathway. Notably, pretreatment with KA significantly attenuated liver injury induced by HFPO-DA exposure in mice, highlighting the pivotal roles of KA in the hepatotoxicity of HFPO-DA.",,10.1021/acs.est.3c08033,Mice;Kynurenic Acid,NA,,kynurenic acid plays a protective role in hepatotoxicity induced by hfpoda in male mice

This development is inconsistent with the initiative of carbon neutrality. Despite the growing numbers of published papers on EAOPs, there is still a lack of guidelines regarding carbon neutral wastewater treatment, thus hampering efforts to achieve sustainable development of EAOPs and attain carbon neutrality. This review systematically summarized recent advances of EAOPs and the potential strategies for developing carbon neutral wastewater treatment. The mechanisms, performance, and defects of recent developed EAOPs via improving electrodes, catalysts and processes were discussed systematically. The effective strategies including energy conservation, material savings, carbon dioxide reduction reaction (CO2RR), and mineralization mitigation were presented in detail. To conserve energy, the review also investigated the power supply capacity, degradation efficiency and costs in transforming renewable energy into electric energy for EAOPs operation. The wind turbines and photovoltaic cells (PVCs) could performe better than fuel cells and triboelectricity nanogenerators (TENGs). Furthermore, the review explored the carbon offset potential of EAOPs by combining with CO2RR. The carbon offset factor ranged from <1\% to similar to 88\%.

This study investigated the impact of a large and persistent un-prescribed fire in a waste storage facility in Stockholm county, Sweden, on the local air quality of two residential areas in close proximity to the fire. In-situ measurements of particulate matter, black carbon and nitrogen oxide concentrations were conducted both during open burning and after the fire was fully covered. In addition, filter samples were collected for offline analysis of organic composition, metal content and toxicity. Strongly increased concentrations of PM10, PM2.5 and black carbon were found during the open burning period, especially when the wind was coming from the direction of the fire.

These variations in different animal models and conditions might have an impact on extrapolating experimental results to humans. Hence, by the meta-analysis, we aimed to clarify and elucidate the species differences in hepatoxicity induced by PBDE exposure in rats and mice across different conditions and moderators. Fourteen in vivo studies that utilized rats and mice models were identified, and data such as author names, year of publication, type of PBDE congeners, rodent species, life stage of exposure, dosage, duration, and hepatoxicity indicators were extracted. The pooled standard mean difference (SMD) with a 95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) was used to evaluate the association between hepatoxicity and PBDE exposure across multiple approaches of measurement. Subgroup analysis, meta-regression, and interaction analysis were utilized to elucidate the species-related differences among the results of the involved studies. The pooled SMD of hepatoxicity of PBDE exposure in the involved in vivo studies was 1.82 (p = 0.016), indicating exposure to PBDE congeners and mixtures is associated with a significant increase in liver toxicity in rodents. Moreover, findings showed that rats were more sensitive to PBDEs than mice with the BDE-209 had the highest SMD value. Among the life stages of exposure, embryonic stage was found to be the most sensitive to hepatoxicity induced by PBDE congeners. Positive relationships were found between the incidence of hepatoxicity with dosage and duration of exposure to PBDE. Interaction analyses showed significant interactions between rodent species (rats or mice), dosage, length of exposure, and hepatotoxicity endpoints. Rats demonstrated an increased susceptibility to variations in organ weight, histopathological changes, mitochondrial dysfunction, and oxidative stress markers. Conversely, mice showed pronounced lipid accumulation and modifications in liver enzyme expression levels. However, significant differences were not found in terms of endoplasmic reticular stress as a mechanistic endpoint for hepatotoxicity. In conclusion, this meta-analysis showed that there might be some species-related differences in hepatoxicity induced by PBDE exposure in rats and mice depending on the parameters used.

The population of the Canary Islands has been studied in terms of its levels of chemical contamination, with numerous biomonitoring studies, which makes it necessary to characterise its exposome and its consequences in terms of disease, in order to implement specific corrective measures to minimize the impact on its health. METHODS // A review of scientific literature (MEDLINE and Scopus) was made, according to PRISMA criteria and PICO methodology, to include studies on biomonitoring of pollutants, or evaluating the effect of pollutants on diseases prevalent in the archipelago. RESULTS //Twenty-five studies, both population-based and hospital-based, were selected. The results show that the exposome is made up of at least 110 compounds or elements, 99 of which appear to be present from the intrauterine stage. The presence of chlorinated pollutants and metals stands out, which seems to be related to the high incidence of metabolic diseases (diabetes), cardiovascular diseases (hypertension) and certain types of neoplasms (breast cancer). In short, the consequences are conditioned by the genome of the exposed population, reinforcing the enormous importance of genome-exposome interactions in the development of pathologies.

Ninety-eight human studies (2004-2021) were identified through database searches (PubMed, Scopus) and citation chaining and focused on phthalates (34 studies), phenols (19) and PFASs (17), while PAHs (12) and recently-used pesticides (3) were less studied. The sample sizes ranged from 10 to 12,476 (median = 159), involving non-pregnant adults (38), pregnant women (11), children/adolescents (15) or both latter populations studied together (23). Several studies included occupational workers (10) and/or highly exposed groups (11) focusing on PAHs, PFASs and pesticides, while studies on phenols and phthalates were performed in the general population only. Analysed omics layers included metabolic profiles (30, including 14 targeted analyses), miRNA (13), gene expression (11), DNA methylation (8), microbiome (5) and proteins (3). Twenty-one studies implemented targeted multi-assays focusing on clinical routine blood lipid traits, oxidative stress or hormones. Overall, DNA methylation and gene expression associations with EDCs did not overlap across studies, while some EDCassociated metabolite groups, such as carnitines, nucleotides and amino acids in untargeted metabolomic studies, and oxidative stress markers in targeted studies, were consistent across studies. Studies had common limitations such as small sample sizes, cross-sectional designs and single sampling for exposure biomonitoring.

The ecological impact and toxicity of this anthropogenic dissolved organic carbon (ADOC) is not related to the presence of a single compound but to the co-occurrence of a myriad of synthetic chemicals with largely unknown effects on heterotrophic microbial communities. We have analyzed the metabolic capacity of metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) of natural oceanic communities from the north Pacific (Costa Rica dome) and Atlantic oceans challenged with environmentally relevant levels of ADOC. In the Atlantic, ADOC-exposed MAGs responded transcriptionally more strongly compared to controls than in the Pacific, possibly mirroring the higher relevance of ADOC compounds as carbon source in oligotrophic environments. The largest proportions of transcripts originated from MAGs belonging in the families Rhodobacteraceae and Flavobacteriaceae, known to play a role on consumption of several OPs. In the Atlantic, archaeal Poseidoniales showed the highest transcription levels after 2 h of ADOC exposure, although no increase of relative abundances in the DNA pool was recorded after 24 h, whereas Methylophaga showed the opposite pattern. Both taxa are suggested to be actively involved in the consumption of biogenic alkanes produced by cyanobacteria. We observed similar gene expression profiles of alkane degradation and methylotrophy signature genes. These findings, plus the chemical degradation of alkanes measured in the experiments, provides experimental evidence of the consumption of anthropogenic hydrocarbons and synthetic chemicals at the low concentrations found in the ocean, and modulation of microbiomes by ADOC.",,10.3389/fenvs.2023.1110169,Military Personnel;Bacteria,NA,,responses to organic pollutants in the tropical pacific and subtropical atlantic oceans by pelagic marine bacteria

These regions are exposed to the presence of contaminants resulting from human activity (local and global), which, in turn, represent a challenge for life forms in these environments. Anthropogenic pollution by semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) in polar ecosystems has been documented since the 1960s. Currently, various studies have shown the presence of SVOCs and their bioaccumulation and biomagnification in the polar regions with negative effects on biodiversity and the ecosystem. Although the production and use of these compounds has been regulated, their persistence continues to threaten biodiversity and the ecosystem. Here, we summarize the current literature regarding microbes and SVOCs in polar regions and pose that bioremediation by native microorganisms is a feasible strategy to mitigate the presence of SVOCs. Our systematic review revealed that microbial communities in polar environments represent a wide reservoir of biodiversity adapted to extreme conditions, found both in terrestrial and aquatic environments, freely or in association with vegetation. Microorganisms adapted to these environments have the potential for biodegradation of SVOCs through a variety of genes encoding enzymes with the capacity to metabolize SVOCs. We suggest that a comprehensive approach at the molecular and ecological level is required to mitigate SVOCs presence in these regions.

Venkata and Chen, Hongfeng and Wu, Yonghong",,,,,"Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) have been widely used around the world due to their high-efficiency and broad-spectrum insecticidal effects. However, they pose a severe threat to ecosystems and human health due to their easy bioaccumulation and high toxicity. Periphyton is ubiquitous in the submerged substrates surface. It plays a crucial role in carbon, nutrients elements cycling and contaminants transformation in environment. Periphyton can remove OCPs through bioadsorption, bioaccumulation and biodegradation, which alters the fate of OCPs in environment. This review presents a comprehensive summary of OCPs occurrence, global cycle, potential harm in environment, and their removal by periphyton. The OCPs residual have been detected frequently in different environmental medias such as water, soil, atmosphere, sediment, and organisms. Their harm is depending on their physicochemical properties and the exposure route. The main compositions and functions of periphyton have been summarized. Moreover, the artificial cultivation methods of periphyton in laboratory and in-situ field are compared. In addition, the mechanisms of periphyton-mediated OCPs removal and the main factors impacting OCPs removal are also discussed. Periphyton could self-regulate its biological communities to adapt to the OCPs and environment, and then regenerate new species to degrade OCPs. Finally, the prospect of OCPs removal by periphyton and future studies are also proposed.

Given its large specific surface area, PM can adsorb and carry a variety of pollutants, including heavy metal ions, ammonia, and persistent organic pollutants such as pathogenic microorganisms. High concentrations of PM induce poultry respiratory inflammation and trig-ger various diseases. However, the pathogenic mechanism of PM in poultry houses on respiratory diseases has not been clarified due to its complexity and lack of accurate assays. In terms of pathogenesis, there are 3 ways to explain this phenomenon: Inhaled PM irritates the respiratory tract, decreases immune resistance, and causes a respiratory disease; respiratory tract irritation by com-pounds presents in PM; infections with pathogenic and non-pathogenic microorganisms attached to PM. The lat-ter 2 modes of influence are more harmful. Specifically, PM can induce the respiratory disease through several toxic mechanisms, including ammonia ingestion and bio-accumulation, lung flora dysbiosis, oxidative stress, and metabolic disorders. Therefore, this review summarizes the characteristics of PM in the poultry house and the impact of poultry PM on respiratory disease and proposes potential pathogenic mechanisms.",,10.1016/j.psj.2023.102556,Poultry,NA,,particulate matter in poultry house on poultry respiratory disease a systematic review

Embryos might be particularly exposed through the maternal offloading of contaminants, possibly leading to disruptions during critical developmental phases. Yet, knowledge on biochemical outcomes of prenatal exposure in elasmobranchs is notably limited. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the effects of prenatal exposure to contaminants in embryos of the critically endangered Brazilian guitarfish, Pseudobatos horkelii. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), pharmaceuticals and per-sonal care products, and metals were determined in embryos. Additionally, glutathione S-transferase activity (GST), glutathione (GSH), and metallothionein levels (MT) were analyzed. Finally, lipid peroxidation levels (LPO) and protein carbonyl groups (PCO) were assessed. Embryonic exposure depended on yolk consumption, which was conspicuous in earlier development. We observed a dilution effect of contaminants levels, potentially related to biotransformation of these compounds throughout the embryonic development. Nevertheless, GST was not correlated to contaminant concentrations. The multivariate relationship between antioxidant components (GSH and GST) and LPO and PCO was negative, suggesting the lack of efficient defense of these biomarkers in early development, leading to oxidative damage. In this context, our results indicate that prenatal exposure to contaminants might impact the redox status in embryos of P. horkelii, leading to oxidative damage. Furthermore, metal concentrations influenced MT levels, suggesting this as a potential detoxification pathway in this species.",,10.1016/j.envpol.2023.121276,,NA,,consequences of prenatal exposure to contaminants in elasmobranchs biochemical outcomes during the embryonic development of pseudobatos horkelii

Moreover, it is difficult to assess the full impact of human exposure to EDCs because adverse effects develop latently and manifest at different ages, even if preclinical and clinical evidence suggest that developing fetus and neonates are most vulnerable to endocrine disruption.Conclusion EDCs represent a major environmental and health issue that has a role in cancer development. There are currently some EDCs that can be considered as carcinogenic, like dioxin and cadmium for breast and thyroid cancer; arsenic, asbestos, and dioxin for prostate cancer; and organochlorines/organohalogens for testicular cancer. New evidence supports the role of other EDCs as possible carcinogenic and pregnant women should avoid risk area and exposure.

Method: Five databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Medline, as well as PsycINFO were systematically retrieved for the records related to pesticide exposure during pregnancy and ASD and ADHD in offspring before August 30, 2022. The pesticide category, maternal age and window of exposure as the main subgroups were presented. Results: 949 studies were initially identified, and 19 studies were eventually included. Eleven were on ASD, seven were on ADHD, and one was on both disorders. Maternal pesticide exposure was positively related to ASD (pooled OR = 1.19 (95\%CI: 1.04 to 1.36)) and ADHD (pooled OR = 1.20 (95\%CI: 1.04 to 1.38)) in offspring.

Studies show that even EDCs which were long abolished are still contributing to the increasing incidence of neoplasia.Aim: To investigate the association between human exposure to EDCs and the risk of endocrine-related tumours: breast, prostate, thyroid, uterus, testis, and ovary.Methods: A systematic review using PubMed, Scopus, and Embase was conducted, searching for original obser-vational studies published between 1980 and 2020, approaching EDCs exposure and endocrine tumourigenic risk in humans. We comprised neoplasia of six endocrine organs. We included all the studies on EDCs reporting tumour odds ratio, risk ratio, or hazard ratio. Study levels of confidence and risk of bias were accessed applying accredited guidelines. Human-made accidents and natural EDCs were not considered in the present study.Results: Our search returned 3271 papers. After duplicate removal and screening, only 237 papers were included (corresponding to 268 records). EDCs were grouped from the most frequently (pesticides) to the least frequently studied (salts). The most tumourigenic EDC groups were phthalates (63\%), heavy metals (54\%), particulate matter (47\%), and pesticides (46\%). Pesticides group comprised the highest number of retrieved studies (n = 133). Increased neoplasia risk was found in 43-67\% of the studies, with a lower value for ovary (43\%) and a higher value for thyroid (67\%).Conclusions: The innovative nature of our review comes from including human studies of six endocrine-related neoplasia aiming to understand the contribution of specific EDCs groups to each organ's tumourigenesis. Thy-roid was the organ presenting the highest cancer risk after EDC exposure which may explain the increasing thyroid cancer incidence. However, detailed and controlled works reporting the effects of EDCs are scarce, probably justifying conflicting results.

The project aims to provide urban planners with information on the remediation of vacant lands using urban runoff pollutant removal techniques. To find the most effective removal method, relevant scholarly papers and case studies are reviewed to see what types of vacant land have many urban runoff pollutants and how to effectively remove contaminants from stormwater runoff in the city by SCMs. The results show that previously developed/used land (but now vacant) has been identified as contaminated sites, including prior residential, commercial, industrial, and parking lot land use from urban areas. SCMs are effective management approaches to reduce nonpoint source pollution problems runoff. It is an umbrella concept that can be used to capture nature-based, cost-effective, and eco-friendly treatment technologies and redevelopment strategies that are socially inclusive, economically viable, and with good public acceptance. Among these removal techniques, a bioretention system tends to be effective for removing dissolved and particulate components of heavy metals and phosphorus. Using different plant species and increasing filter media depth has identified the effectiveness of eliminating nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N). A medium with a high hydraulic conductivity covers an existing medium with low hydraulic conductivity, and the result will be a higher and more effective decrease for phosphorus (P) pollutants. In addition, wet ponds were found to be highly effective at removing polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, with removal rates as high as 99\%. For the removal of perfluoroalkyl acid (PFAA) pollutants, despite the implementation of SCMs in urban areas to remove PFAAs and particulate-related contaminants in stormwater runoff, the current literature has little information on SCMs' removal of PFAAs. Studies have also found that VUL's size, shape, and connectivity are significantly inversely correlated with the reduction in stormwater runoff. This paper will help planners and landscape designers make efficient decisions around removing pollutants from VUL stormwater runoff, leading to better use of these spaces.",,10.3390/su141912906,,NA,,a systematic review of the scientific literature on pollutant removal from stormwater runoff from vacant urban lands

Faced with the potentially harmful effects of ECs on humans, regulatory agencies around the world require the integration of epidemiological, in vivo toxicological, and in vitro mechanistic data to provide the necessary information for hazard classification, labeling, and risk management of chemicals. However, animal studies have time-consuming and high-cost defects and ethical problems. High-throughput in vitro assays are also unable to provide systematic toxicological information for chemical hazard classification for over 100000 chemicals in commerce. Recently, computing resources and artificial intelligence have innovatively improved the accuracy and speed of machine learning (ML) algorithms, and the structural biology and deep learning (DL) algorithms (e.g., AlphaFold2 and AF2Complex) have incrementally resolved a large number of biomolecular crystal structures. Thus, the use of computational toxicology techniques in environmental toxicology has increased significantly. It is estimated that computational toxicology techniques can perform virtual screening of millions of compounds in a limited amount of time for the contaminant-biomolecule interaction process. Thus, computational toxicology techniques can reduce the initial experimental cost of identifying environmental emerging contaminants, increase information on the toxicity mechanisms of ECs, and improve the efficiency of hazard identification of ECs by regulatory authorities. This study systematically reviews computational toxicology techniques commonly used to analyze ECs-biomolecule interactions, including molecular docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, and machine learning-based modelling. Molecular docking is a well-established molecular simulation method that explores the interactions between biomolecules and small molecules to predict their binding modes and binding affinities. MD can simulate the flexible binding process of contaminant-biomolecule and the dynamic conformational shift process of contaminant-biomolecule complexes, providing more comprehensive information on the interaction mechanism. Machine learning-based modelling is a novel computational toxicology technique that is completely different from molecular simulation. It mainly uses publicly available structural information and in chemico, in vitro, and in vivo bioactivity data to construct (quantitative) structure-activity relationships (Q)SARs based on ML algorithms, and uses (Q)SAR models to rapidly improve the efficiency of virtual screening of ECs targeted at biomolecules, and further deepen the analysis of contaminant-biomolecule interaction mechanisms in complex biological contexts. In this paper, the main applications of these techniques in the field of environmental toxicology in recent years are systematically reviewed, including the mechanistic studies of contaminant-biomolecule interactions and high-throughput virtual screening. The advantages and limitations of these techniques in terms of ligand-receptor interaction, explainability, training efficiency, computational depth, and biological processes are discussed. Results showed that MD simulations, which can deeply explore contaminant-biomolecule interactions, are unable to achieve the high-throughput virtual screening of ECs. Machine learning-based modelling, which can reflect the complex biological processes and achieve high accuracy prediction, unable to effectively interpret the prediction results due to the `black box' defects. Molecular docking, which has the potential to be a high throughput virtual screening method, is limited by local sampling and approximate scoring function deficiencies. These problems limit the ability of molecular docking to analyze more comprehensive mechanisms of ECs-biomolecule interactions. Therefore, only the combination of multiple computational toxicology techniques to develop an integrated workflow for mechanistic analysis and virtual screening can compensate for their respective shortcomings and obtain optimal results. However, how to increase the computational throughput screening while maintaining the mechanism analysis remains a key issue to be addressed in the future.",,10.1360/TB-2022-0613,,NA,,computational toxicology studies on the interactions between environmental contaminants and biomacromolecules

Although avian colouration plays many functions, including concealment, thermoregulation, or advertisement as a distasteful prey, a quality-signalling role in sexual selection has attracted most research attention. Sexually selected ornaments are thought to be more susceptible to external stressors than naturally selected traits, and as such, they might be used as a test for environmental quality. For this reason, the last two decades have seen numerous studies on the impact of anthropogenic pollution on the expression of various avian colour traits. Herein, we provide the first meta-analytical summary of these results and examine whether there is an interaction between the mechanism of colour production (carotenoid-based, melanin-based and structural) and the type of anthropogenic factor (categorised as heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, urbanisation, or other). Following the assumption of heightened condition dependence of ornaments under sexual selection, we also expected the magnitude of effect sizes to be higher in males. The overall effect size was close to significance and negative, supporting a general detrimental impact of anthropogenic pollutants on avian colouration. In contrast to expectations, there was no interaction between pollution types and colour-producing mechanisms. Yet there were significant differences in sensitivity between colour-producing mechanisms, with carotenoid-based colouration being the most affected by anthropogenic environmental disturbances. Moreover, we observed no significant tendency towards heightened sensitivity in males. We identified a publication gap on structural colouration, which, compared to pigment-based colouration, remains markedly understudied and should thus be prioritised in future research.

Further, the combination of plants and associated microbes such as rhizospheric bacteria or arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi has the potential to significantly improve the nano-phytoremediation of heavy metal contaminated soil. This review focuses on recent developments on nano-phytoremediation, plant root associated microbes, and their interaction for developing an integrated and efficient nano-phytoremediation strategy for improved soil remediation in general and for soil contaminated with heavy metal. The application of nanomaterials combined with phytoremediation was discussed.",,10.1007/s13762-024-05466-2,"Metals, Heavy;Fungi",NA,,potential of nanophytoremediation of heavy metal contaminated soil emphasizing the role of mycorrhizal fungi in the amelioration process

Palladium (Pd) has been widely used as a catalyst/electrocatalyst in these reduction processes. However, due to the limited reserves and high cost of Pd, it is essential to gain a better understanding of the Pd-catalyzed decontamination process to design affordable and sustainable Pd catalysts. This review provides a systematic summary of recent advances in understanding Pd-catalyzed reductive decontamination processes and designing Pd-based nanocatalysts for the reductive treatment of water-borne pollutants, with special focus on the interactions and transformation mechanisms of pollutant molecules on Pd catalysts at the atomic scale. The discussion begins by examining the adsorption of pollutants onto Pd sites from a thermodynamic viewpoint. This is followed by an explanation of the molecular-level reaction mechanism, demonstrating how electron-donors participate in the reductive transformation of pollutants. Next, the influence of the Pd reactive site structure on catalytic performance is explored. Additionally, the process of Pd-catalyzed reduction in facilitating the oxidation of pollutants is briefly discussed. The longevity of Pd catalysts, a crucial factor in determining their practicality, is also examined. Finally, we argue for increased attention to mechanism study, as well as precise construction of Pd sites under batch synthesis conditions, and the use of Pd-based catalysts/electrocatalysts in the treatment of concentrated pollutants to facilitate resource recovery.",,10.1021/acs.est.3c09198,,NA,,critical review of pdcatalyzed reduction process for treatment of waterborne pollutants

The consortium utilized 4-CP as a single carbon source at a wide pH range, temperature, and in the presence of heavy metals. The immobilized consortium retained its degradation capacity for an extended period. The 4-aminoantipyrine colorimetric analysis revealed complete mineralization of 4-CP up to 200 mg/L concentration and followed the zero-order kinetics. The addition of glycerol and yeast extract enhanced the degradation efficiency. The consortium showed both ortho- and meta-cleavage activity of catechol dioxygenase. Whole genome sequence (WGS) analysis revealed the microbial compositions and functional genes related to xenobiotic degradation pathways. The identified genes were mapped on the KEGG database to construct the 4-CP degradation pathway.

Using transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses, we identified key genes and metabolites associated with oxidative stress and lipid metabolism imbalance induced by MPs. Upregulated genes (Scd1, Fasn, Irs2, and Lpin) and elevated levels of arachidonic and palmitic acid accumulation were observed in MP -exposed mice, but not in those exposed to SeNPs. Further experiments confirmed that SeNPs significantly attenuated liver lipid accumulation and degeneration caused by MPs. Histological results and pathway screening validated our findings, revealing that MPs suppressed the Ppar alpha pathway and Nrf2 pathway, whereas SeNPs activated both pathways.

In this paper, histopathology, transcriptomics, 4D-DIA proteomics, and LC -MS metabolomics of rats exposed to 2000 ppm and 6000 ppm C5F10O are analyzed to reveal the mechanisms of toxicity and health risks. Histopathological shows that inflammatory cell infiltration, epithelial cell hyperplasia, and alveolar atrophy accompanied by alveolar wall thickening are present in both low -dose and high -dose groups. Analysis of transcriptomic and 4D-DIA proteomic show that Cell cycle and DNA replication can be activated by both 2000 ppm and 6000 ppm C5F10O to induce cell proliferation. In addition, it also leads to the activation of pathways such as Antigen processing and presentation, Cell adhesion molecules and Complement and coagulation cascades, T cell receptor signal path, Th1 and T cell receptor signal path, Th1 and Th2 cell differentiation, complement and coagulation cascades. Finally, LC -MS metabolomics analysis confirms that the metabolic pathways associated with glycerophospholipids, arachidonic acid, and linoleic acid are disrupted and become more severe with increasing doses.

Moreover, compared with the C-H monochalcogenation, reports of selective mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive dichalcogenation of C-H bonds are relatively scarce. The past decade has witnessed significant advancements in selective mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive dichalcogenation of various C(sp(2))-H and C(sp(3))-H bonds via transition-metal-catalyzed/mediated, photocatalytic, electrochemical or metal-free approaches. In light of the significance of both mono- and dichalcogen-containing compounds in various fields of chemical science and the critical issue of chemoselectivity in organic synthesis, the present review systematically summarizes the advances in these research fields, with a special focus on elucidating scopes and mechanistic aspects.

It is regularly transported from developed to developing nations, where it is disassembled informally in search of precious metals, thus increasing human exposure to harmful compounds. Africa has a serious problem with e-waste, as there are significant facilities in Ghana and Nigeria where imported e-waste is unsafely dismantled. however, because they are in high demand and less expensive than new ones, old electronic and electrical items are imported in large quantities, just like in many developing nations. After that, these objects are frequently scavenged to recover important metals through heating, burning, incubation in acids, and other techniques. Serious health hazards are associated with these activities for workers and individuals close to recycling plants. At e-waste sites in Africa, there have been documented instances of elevated concentrations of hazardous elements, persistent organic pollutants, and heavy metals in dust, soils, and vegetation, including plants consumed as food. Individuals who handle and dispose of e-waste are exposed to highly hazardous chemical substances. This paper examines heavy metal risks around e-waste sites and comparable municipal dumpsites in major African cities. Elevated concentrations of these heavy metals metal in downstream aquatic and marine habitats have resulted in additional environmental impacts. These effects have been associated with unfavourable outcomes in marine ecosystems, such as reduced fish stocks characterized by smaller sizes, increased susceptibility to illness, and decreased population densities. The evidence from the examined studies shows how much e-waste affects human health and the environment in Africa.

The risk of cancer from Ni and Pb was calculated to be 1 in 10,000 on average for each, classifying it as a moderate risk. Quantitative analysis revealed that heavy metal concentrations of Pb, Ni, Cd, and Zn in most fish samples exceeded reference safety values. Simultaneously, hazard analysis identified critical concerns regarding Pb content in one sample, and cumulative toxin loads in almost every sample were deemed unsafe for regular consumption. In addition to quantitative assessments, a qualitative survey employed observation techniques, focus group discussions, and key informant interviews to investigate consumption behaviors and viewpoints on fish contamination.

The investigation focused on studies delineating the correlation between endocrine disruptors, microRNAs, and endometriosis. To optimize the search scope, keywords and subject headings were used as search terms. Then, two authors rigorously assessed studies using criteria, selecting 27 studies from various databases. Notably, dioxins, organochlorine pesticides, and polychlorinated biphenyls exhibited a solid connection for endometriosis, while bisphenol A and phthalates yielded conflicting results. The heightened presence of bisphenol A, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalates was linked to altered gene expression, including genes like AKR1B10, AKR1C3, and FAM49B. MicroRNAs like miRNA-31, miRNA-144, and miRNA-145 emerged as vital factors in the onset of endometriosis and progression. Furthermore, elevated expression of miR-1304-3p, miR-544, and miR-3684 and reduced expression of miR-3935 and miR-4427 exert substantial influence on signaling pathways like NF-kappa B, MAPK, and Wnt/beta-catenin.

Autochthonous microorganisms in dumpsites exhibit various degrees of responses to contaminants. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of information on the types and concentration of pollutants and the array of microorganisms in these dumpsites which may play important roles in the metabolism of such pollutants or other community processes. Therefore, determining the microbial community structure in such contaminated sites across a municipality is essential for profiling the taxa that would serve as consensus degraders of the pollutants. In this study, soil samples from three dumpsites (Cele, CS; Solous, SS; and Computer Village, CVS) were characterized for geochemical properties using GC-MS, MP-AES, and other analytical protocols, while the dynamics of bacterial communities were evaluated based on their 16S rRNA gene barcodes. A significant difference in the bacterial communities was observed among the dumpsites in relation to the extent of pollution caused by POPs and HMs. CVS, with the highest HM contamination, was rich in Actinobacteria (41.7\%) and Acidobacteria (10.2\%), in contrast to CS and SS. Proteobacteria (34.1\%) and Firmicutes (20\%) were the dominant phyla in CS (highest POP contamination), while Bacteroidetes (45.5\%) and Proteobacteria (39.9\%) were dominant in SS soil. Bacillus was the dominant genus in the most polluted dumpsite. Canonical correspondence analysis revealed that polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and HMs shaped the structure of the bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the most polluted dumpsite. Out of a total of 706 OTUs, 628 OTUs exhibited a significant correlation (>50\%) with benzo(b)fluoranthene, azobenzene, dibenzofurans, pyrene, dibenzo(a,l)pyrene, Cu, and Zn. In particular, Proteobacteria (Achromobacter sp. and Serratia sp.), Bacteroidetes (Zhouia sp.), and Firmicutes (Bacillus sp.) were suggested to be pivotal to the ecophysiology of dumpsite soils contaminated with POPs and HMs. The results generally underscored the importance of metagenomic and physicochemical analyses of polluted systems in enabling correlations for useful prediction of drivers of such ecosystems.

This research investigated the estrogens pollution levels in six mangroves located in the Southern China. The estrogen levels were found to be in the range of 5.3-24.9 ng/g dry weight, suggesting that these mangroves had been seriously contaminated. The bacterial communities under estrogen stress were further enriched by supplementing 17 beta-estradiol (E2) as the sole carbon source. The enriched bacterial communities showed an excellent E2 degradation capacity > 95 \%. These communities were able to transform E2 into estrone (E1), 4-hydroxy-estrone, and keto-estrone, etc. 16 S rDNA sequencing and metagenomics analysis revealed that bacterial taxa Oleiagrimonas, Pseudomonas, Terrimonas, and Nitratireductor etc. were the main contributors to estrogen degradation. Moreover, the genes involved in E2 degradation were enriched in the microbial communities, including the genes encoding 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, estrone 4-hydroxylase, etc. Finally, the analyses of functional genes and binning genomes demonstrated that E2 was degraded by bacterial communities via dehydrogenation into E1 by 17 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase. E1 was then catabolically converted to 3a alpha-H- 4 alpha(3'-propanoate)-7a beta-methylhexahydro-1,5-indanedione via 4,5-seco pathway.

Two-hundred and seven studies were used for analyses to determine the spatial and temporal trends of FR exposure.

The findings revealed that the addition of Mn-HA significantly facilitated the removal of ammonium and nitrate potentially by Mnammox (anaerobic ammonium oxidation mediated by Mn (IV)-oxide reduction) and Mn-based autotrophic denitrification. Metagenomic analyses suggested the presence of manganese-redox microorganisms involved in nitrification and denitrification, indicating the occurrence of manganese redox-coupled nitrogen metabolism processes. Additionally, the production and consumption of bio-MnOx (bio-Manganese Oxides) were observed in conjunction with denitrification and nitrification. The production of unequal amounts of bio-MnOx suggested that bio-MnOx may have been deposited in the sediment. This was confirmed by the BCR sequential extraction experiment.

Metabolome-wide association studies were performed for PBB-153 separately for each generation and Sigma PCB (PCB-118, PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-180) in the two generations combined, as both had direct PCB exposure. Metabolite and metabolic pathway alterations were evaluated following a well-established untargeted HRM workflow.Results: Mean levels were 1.75 ng/mL {[}standard deviation (SD): 13.9] for PBB-153 and 1.04 ng/mL (SD: 0.788) for Sigma PCB. Sixty-two and 26 metabolic features were significantly associated with PBB-153 in F0 and F1 {[}false discovery rate (FDR) p<0.2], respectively. There were 2,861 features associated with Sigma PCB (FDR p<0.2). Metabolic pathway enrichment analysis using a bioinformatics tool revealed perturbations associated with Sigma PCB in numerous oxidative stress and inflammation pathways (e.g., carnitine shuttle, glycosphingolipid, and vitamin B9 metabolism). Metabolic perturbations associated with PBB-153 in F0 were related to oxidative stress (e.g., pentose phosphate and vitamin C metabolism) and in F1 were related to energy production (e.g., pyrimidine, amino sugars, and lysine metabolism). Using authentic chemical standards, we confirmed the chemical identity of 29 metabolites associated with Sigma PCB levels (level 1 evidence).Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that serum PBB-153 is associated with alterations in inflammation and oxidative stress-related pathways, which differed when stratified by generation. We also found that Sigma PCB was associated with the downregulation of important neurotransmitters, serotonin, and 4-aminobutanoate.

However, our understanding of the associations among rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microorganisms, and POPs degradation in different plant growth stages is limited. We combined stable-isotope probing (SIP), high-throughput sequencing, and metabolomics to analyze changes in rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microbes, and BaP biodegradation in the early growth stages (tillering, jointing) and later stage (booting) of ryegrass. Microbial community structures differed significantly among growth stages. Metabolisms such as benzenoids and carboxylic acids tended to be enriched in the early growth stage, while lipids and organic heterocyclic compounds dominated in the later stage. From SIP, eight BaP-degrading microbes were identified, and most of which such as Ilumatobacter and Singulisphaera were first linked with BaP biodegradation. Notably, the relationship between the differential metabolites and BaP degra-dation efficiency further suggested that BaP-degrading microbes might metabolize BaP directly to produce benzenoid metabolites (3-hydroxybenzo{[}a]pyrene), or utilize benzenoids (phyllodulcin) to stimulate the co-metabolism of BaP in early growth stage; some lipids and organic acids, e.g. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, might provide nutrients for the degraders to promote BaP metabolism in later stage. Accordingly, we determined that certain rhizospheric metabolites might regulate the rhizospheric microbial communities at different growth stages, and shift the composition and diversity of BaP-degrading bacteria, thereby enhancing in situ BaP degradation.

Challenged by the extreme conditions of high-altitude environments, the strategies implemented by highland animals to adjust their diet and gut microbial composition and modulate their metabolic substrates remain largely unexplored. By employing a typical human commensal species, the Eurasian tree sparrow (Passer montanus, ETS), as a model species, we studied the differences in diet, digestive tract morphology and enzyme activity, gut microbiota, and metabolic energy profiling between highland (the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, QTP; 3230 m) and lowland (Shijiazhuang, Hebei; 80 m) populations. Our results showed that highland ETSs had enlarged digestive organs and longer small intestinal villi, while no differences in key digestive enzyme activities were observed between the two populations. The 18S rRNA sequencing results revealed that the dietary composition of highland ETSs were more animal-based and less plant-based than those of the lowland ones. Furthermore, 16S rRNA sequencing results suggested that the intestinal microbial com-munities were structurally segregated between populations. PICRUSt metagenome predictions further indicatedthat the expression patterns of microbial genes involved in material and energy metabolism, immune system and infection, and xenobiotic biodegradation were strikingly different between the two populations. Analysis of liver metabolomics revealed significant metabolic differences between highland and lowland ETSs in terms of sub-strate utilization, as well as distinct sex-specific alterations in glycerophospholipids. Furthermore, the interplay between diet, liver metabolism, and gut microbiota suggests a dietary shift resulting in corresponding changes in gut microbiota and metabolic functions. Our findings indicate that highland ETSs have evolved to optimize digestion and absorption, rely on more protein-rich foods, and possess gut microbiota tailored to their dietary composition, likely adaptive physiological and ecological strategies adopted to cope with extreme highland environments.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.167079,,NA,,coping with extremes alternations in diet gut microbiota and hepatic metabolic functions in a highland passerine

For the host mice engrafted with POP-containing fat pad, there was dysregulation of the fatty acids and glycerides observed in all the organs studied 3 days after the graft. However, there was no longer a significant change in the metabolites 21 days after the graft. The difference in significant values and metabolite regulation in each of the skeletal muscles showed that the POP mixture affects different types of skeletal muscle in a heterogeneous manner.

Unraveling the phytotoxic mechanisms of POPs in crops is critical for evaluating their environmental risks. Herein, the molecular mechanism of POP-induced phytotoxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was analyzed using metabolic profile, enzyme activity, and gene expression as linkages, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalate esters. Despite no observable changes in phenotypic traits (e.g., biomass and length of aboveground), the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were promoted under stresses of the tested POPs, particularly 2,2',4,4'-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Metabolomics analysis revealed that ROS contents positively correlated with metabolic perturbation levels (r = 0.83), among which the galactose metabolism was significantly inhibited when exposed to DBP, DEHP, or BDE-47. The a-Galactosidase (a-Gal) involved in galactose metabolism was targeted as the key enzyme for the phytotoxicity of DBP, DEHP, and BDE-47, which was revealed by the inhibition of saccharide levels (45.5-82.1\%), the catalytic activity of a-Gal (18.5-24.3\%), and the gene expression (28.5-34.5\%). Molecular docking simulation suggested that the three POPs occupied the active sites of a-Gal and formed a stable protein-ligand complex, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of a-Gal. Partial least-squares regression analysis indicated that a-Gal activity was negatively associated with hydrogen bond acceptor, rotatable bond, and topological polar surface area of POPs.

Therefore, it is important to summarize the main findings of previous studies on DP in human tissues and to provide potential guidance for future studies. In this paper, DP levels in different populations and human tissues worldwide since 2009 were systematically reviewed. DP levels in human tissues of workers in e-waste dismantling sites in Guangdong Province, China (median 190 ng center dot g (-1) lw in serum) and DP manufacturing plants in Jiangsu Province, China (mean 857 ng center dot g (-1) lw in whole-blood) are the highest reported worldwide. DP levels in tissues of the general population in recent studies are close to those of residents near ewaste dismantling sites, which should be of concern. DP levels in different human tissues were found to be positively correlated with a pattern of blood > breast milk > adipose tissue. The distribution of DP in different human tissues is mainly lipid-driven and may also be influenced by the interaction of DP with proteins such as human serum albumin. Most of the past studies determined the isomer stereoselectivity of DP in human tissuesonly by comparing the composition of DP in commercial DP products and human tissues, which lacks evidence of mechanism. Recently, a significantly different affinity of DP isomers for proteins was found, which seems to confirm the isomer selectivity of DP in human tissues. We simulated the binding of DP to human serum albumin and DP to thyroid hormone receptor ss by molecular docking and found differences in the binding behavior of synDP and anti-DP to the selected proteins. Molecular docking seems to be a feasible approach for future studies to predict and reveal the mechanisms of DP behavior and health effects in human tissues.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.166156,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Tissue Distribution,NA,,levels tissue distribution and isomer stereoselectivity of dechlorane plus in humans a critical review

Medical waste (14.5 \%) received the highest attention among the negative impacts.

Therefore, biosolid reuse is subject to regulations, mandatory analyses are performed on heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants or pathogens. Conventional methods for the analysis of heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants are demanding, lengthy, and sometimes unsafe. Here, we propose mass spectrometry imaging as a faster and safer method using small amounts of material to monitor heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants in different types of biosolids, allowing for ecological and health risk assessment before reuse. Our methodology can be extended to other soil-like matrices. Mass spectrometry imaging is a suitable tool for the analysis of non-cohesive materials. Here, authors show that it can be used to detect persistent organic pollutants (POPs) and heavy metals (HMs) in biosolids using small amounts of material with speed and safety.",,10.1038/s41467-023-40051-0,Mass Spectrometry,NA,,mass spectrometry imaging for biosolids characterization to assess ecological or health risks before reuse

In addition, CHI could induce an imbalance in the gut microbiota of mice. Furthermore, the results of the antibiotic treatment and gut microbiota transplantation experiments showed that the CHI could induce obesity in mice in a gut microbiota-dependent manner. Based on the results of targeted metabolomics and gene expression analysis, CHI could disturb the bile acids (BAs) metabolism of mice, causing the inhibition of the signal response of BAs re-ceptor FXR and leading to glycolipid metabolism disorders in liver and epiWAT of mice. The administration of FXR agonist GW4064 and CDCA could significantly improve the CHI-induced obesity in mice.

The research question for this systematic review is as follows: is there a difference between the effects of sustainable agriculture and conventional farming methods on rice grain end-use quality, healthfulness, and safety? The studies (n = 23) examined for this review suggest that organic production practices don't influence most end-use quality (e.g., chalk, milling yield, pasting properties) and healthfulness (e.g., gamma-oryzanol fraction and tocols) traits studied, or if it does, it will be to a small degree. If differences in end-use quality traits are found, they will be associated with grain protein content, which varies along with the dose of nitrogen applied during rice growth. We conclude that the studies evaluated in this review found that organically produced rice grain was less likely to contain residues of the pesticides (e.g., organochlorine) examined in the study than the rice is grown using conventional methods. There was some evidence that organically grown rice is more likely to be contaminated with mycotoxin-producing fungi and some mycotoxins.

In this study, the facilitation of Flu on the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) generation executed by acidogenic microbial population during sludge acidogenic fermentation (37 degrees C, SRT = 8 d, pH = 10.0) was investigated. The accumulation of VFAs (particularly acetic acid) increased initially and then declined with the increasing of Flu concentration (0-500 mg/kg dry sludge), which reached a maximum (3211.1 mg COD/L) as Flu content was 200 mg/kg dry sludge. The Fluenhanced VFAs production was primarily attributed to the shift of hydrolysis/acidification, as well as the corresponding functional microbial community and the activity of enzymes. Based on the metagenomics analysis, the conversion of organic substrates, i.e. amino acid and monosaccharide, into VFAs embraced in hydrolysis/acidification shaped by Flu was constructed at the genetic level. The relative abundances of genes included in aminotransfer and deamination process of amino acid and glycolysis of monosaccharide into VFA-precursors (pyruvate, acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA), and the further formation of VFAs were improved due to the Flu presence.

When MPs/NPs enter different organisms, they transport various pollutants, including heavy metals, persistent organic pollutants, drugs, bacteria, and viruses, from the environment. On this basis, this paper summarizes the combined toxicity induced by MPs/NPs accumulating contaminants from the environment and entering organisms through a systematic review of 162 articles. Moreover, the factors influ-encing toxic interactions are critically discussed, thus highlighting the dominant role of the relative concen-trations of contaminants in the combined toxic effects. Furthermore, for the first time, we describe the threats posed by MPs/NPs combined with other pollutants to human health, as well as their cytotoxic behavior and mechanism. We found that the ``Trojan horse{''} effect of nanoplastics can increase the bioaccessibility of envi-ronmental pollutants, thus increasing the carcinogenic risk to humans. Simultaneously, the complex pollutants entering the cells are observed to be constantly dissociated due to the transport of lysosomes. However, current research on the intracellular release of MP/NP-loaded pollutants is relatively poor, which hinders the accurate in vivo toxicity assessment of combined pollutants. Based on the findings of our critical review, we recommend analyzing the toxic effects by clarifying the dose relationship of each component pollutant in cells, which is challenging yet crucial to exploring the toxic mechanism of combined pollution.

Many causes of AMI exist, which usually begin with mucosal injury. Onset is insiduous and there is frequent diagnostic delay.

The prevention and treatment of AMI by intraluminal delivery of oxygen has yet to be investigated in the clinical setting. This article aims to systemically review experimental studies investigating this novel therapy. MethodsFollowing the PRISMA guidelines, searches of PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE databases were performed up to June 2022. Two independent investigators extracted the data. ResultsThere were 20 experimental studies, 16 of which used an occlusive ischaemia reperfusion model. Six different formulations were used to deliver intraluminal oxygen, with perflurocarbon being the most common. Studies consistently showed local and systemic benefits. Intraluminal oxygen therapy improved histological severity of mucosal injury in all studies when oxygen was delivered during the ischaemia phase, but could cause harm if given during the reperfusion phase.

In the USA, the health sector accounts for 8.5\% of total GHG emissions. The primary objective of this systematic review was to critically analyse the carbon emissions data from GI endoscopic activity. DesignThe GI endoscopy carbon cycle was evaluated at preprocedural, intraprocedural and postprocedural levels. We performed a systematic literature search of articles published on these issues until 30 June 2022 and discussed these available data on endoscopy unit GHG carbon cycle, barriers to reduce GHG emissions and potential solutions. The inclusion criteria were any full-text articles (observational, clinical trials, brief communications, case series and editorials) reporting waste generation from GI endoscopy. Abstracts, news articles and conference proceedings were excluded. ResultsOur search yielded 393 records in PubMed, 1708 in Embase and 24 in Google Scholar. After application of inclusion and exclusion factors, we focused on 9 fulllength articles in detail, only 3 of them were cross-sectional studies (all from the USA), the others reviews or position statements. Therefore, the quality of the studies could not be assessed due to heterogeneity in definitions and amount of emissions. ConclusionsRecognition of carbon emissions generated by GI endoscopy activity is critical. Although multiple limitations exists for quantification of these emission, there is an urgent need for collecting proper data as well as examining novel methods for reduction of these emissions for a sustainable endoscopic practices in the future.",,10.1136/gutjnl-2022-328369,,NA,,production and possible reduction of greenhouse gases produced during gi endoscopy activity a systematic review of available literature

Of the three bacterial taxa known to carry out anaerobic dechlorination of DCM, `Candidatus Formimonas warabiya' strain DCMF is the only organism that can also ferment non-chlorinated substrates, including quaternary amines (i.e., choline and glycine betaine) and methanol. Strain DCMF is present within enrichment culture DFE, which was derived from an organochlorine-contaminated aquifer. We utilized the metabolic versatility of strain DCMF to carry out comparative metaproteomics of cultures grown with DCM or glycine betaine. This revealed differential abundance of numerous proteins, including a methyltransferase gene cluster (the mec cassette) that was significantly more abundant during DCM degradation, as well as highly conserved amongst anaerobic DCM-degrading bacteria. This lends strong support to its involvement in DCM dechlorination. A putative glycine betaine methyltransferase was also discovered, adding to the limited knowledge about the fate of this widespread osmolyte in anoxic subsurface environments. Furthermore, the metagenome of enrichment culture DFE was assembled, resulting in five high quality and two low quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes.

Because of the nature of these chemical compounds including toxicity, stability, and capability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify, PBDEs have posed a great challenge and risk to human health and wildlife. Therefore, the side effects of exposure to PBDEs as ubiquitous pollutants in the environment on cancer progression were investigated using a systematic review (SR) survey. To achieve this goal, forty studies were considered after defining the search terms and inclusion criteria, and/or exclusion criteria; the eligible records were collected from the international bibliographic databases. Based on the findings of the reviewed records, environmental exposure to the BFRs including PBDEs has a positive association with different mechanisms that induce cancer progression. However, the findings of the reviewed studies were not totally consistent with the mode of action and side effects are yet to be fully elucidated. Several articles have reported that BFRs can be carcinogenic and induce epithelial to mesenchymal transition via different mechanisms. The main mode of action involved in the environmental exposure to BFRs and the risk of cancer progression is endoplasmic reticulum and oxidative stress (OS).

One of the current hot research topics is investigating the role of AhR activation by environmental pollutants on glucose homeostasis and insulin secretion, and hence the pathogenesis of diabetes mellitus. To date, epidemiological studies have suggested that persistent exposure to environmental contaminants such as dioxins, with subsequent AhR activation increases the risk of specific comorbidities such as obesity and diabetes. The importance of AhR signaling in various molecular pathways highlights that the role of this receptor is far beyond just xenobiotic metabolism.

A total of 60 sharks were sampled in situ aboard fishing vessels, and the concentrations of a set of metals and POPs were analysed in various tissues and complemented with stable isotope analyses. High levels of contaminants were found in most sharks sampled. The concentrations of most metals were higher in the muscle when compared with the liver. Regarding the dangers to consumers posed by the concentrations of arsenic (As), mercury (Hg), and lead (Pb), over 75\% of the sharks presented muscle concentrations of at least one contaminant above the legal limits for human consumption, and a risk assessment determined that consumption of meat of these sharks exceeding 0.07 Kg per week could potentially expose human consumers to dangerous amounts of methylmercury (MeHg).

Their application in agricultural fields and homes increased environmental pollution. Studies showed their harmful effects on human health, specifically children, who are more vulnerable than adults. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has introduced several pesticides as carcinogens. This study aims to systematically summarize and review all studies related to pesticides and cancer. Methodology: This systematic review is based on PRISMA rules. Three central databases were employed to find studies on pesticide exposure and cancer correlation published from 2017 to September 2022. Results: After reviewing several studies, we found that most studies revealed a significant relationship between pesticide exposure and an increased cancer incidence rate. Among the most studied group of pesticides is organochlorine (OC) pesticides. OC pesticides and their residues could significantly increase cancer in children and adults. Mechanistic studies revealed that pesticides could increase the risk of different cancers by genetics, like an increased expression of some genes like p21, p53 or epigenetic impairments. Cell cycle impairments like expanding the G1 to S phase transition are another mechanism of causing cancer. DNA methylation and histone modifications increase the risk of numerous cancers. Conclusion: Based on epidemiological studies, pesticides are a significant concern to human health, specifically cancer development, and should be more restrained.

Municipal solid waste incineration (MSWI) process has become one of the most dominant discharge sources of dioxins. A comprehensive discussion about dioxin formation mechanisms was reviewed in this paper, and the mechanisms of high-temperature gas-phase reaction and ``de novo{''} synthesis were systematically illustrated in the form of diagrams. What's more, the effects of various influencing factors on the formation of PCDD/Fs were briefly analyzed in the form of a table. We believed that temperature, catalyst, chlorine source, carbon source, oxygen concentration and moisture were necessary factors for PCDD/Fs formation. Control technologies of dioxins in MSWI process were summarized subsequently from three stages: pre-combustion, in-combustion and post-combustion, and a device for synergistic removal of dioxins based on multi-field force coupling and technical routes for controlling dioxin emissions were proposed, so as to provide mechanisms and methods for effectively reducing the emission concentration of dioxins. An introduction was also conducted of dioxin control technologies in municipal solid waste incineration fly ash (MSWI-FA) in this paper, and their mechanisms, advantages, disadvantages and technical maturity were illustrated in the form of diagrams, which can provide theory and reference for in-depth research of follow-up scholars and industrial application of dioxin control technologies. Finally, current research hotspots, challenges and future research directions were proposed.

The biodegradability of dispersed oil and dispersants themselves are key factors for the national consideration of the approval, stockpile, and usage of dispersants. However, it is unknown whether shrimp-waste-based dispersant (SWD) has high bioavailability or facilitates the biodegradation of dispersed oil. In this study, we tackled the biodegradation of oil dispersed by a purified SWD. Furthermore, the SWD biodegradability was evaluated by exploring the degradation genes via metagenomic sequencing, analyzing the enzymatic activities for dispersant biodegradation by molecular docking, and discussing the SWD toxicity. We discovered that the SWD facilitated the biodegra-dation of two crude oils (Alaska North Slope and Marine Fuel-No.6). The metagenomic analysis with molecular docking showed that fresh seawater had feasible enzymes to degrade the SWD to safety components. Addi-tionally, the SWD was low toxic and high bioactive.

Despite this, knowledge of the fate of plastic debris in estuaries is limited. Our study assesses the current state of knowledge on the distribution of microplastic debris in estuaries and their intertidal habitats. The literature is reviewed, and an estuarine plastics conceptual model is presented. The conceptual model is populated with data to show the globally averaged standing stocks of microplastic (< 5 mm) debris in estuarine waters and sediments. Estuarine plastic debris studies have previously focused on subtidal sediment and surface waters more than intertidal habitats. Estimated mean microplastic abundance is found to be greater (H = 53.136, P = 0.000175) per volume of sediment than per volume of water, although there are large standard deviations within habitats and some caveats regarding variation in methods and limited data in published studies. We found that the most commonly recovered microplastics align with the most commonly used polymers, and that the rates of microplastic transfer between estuarine compartments remain poorly understood. This study informs global plastic transport models by demonstrating the ability of estuaries to trap large quantities of microplastic debris, but substantial differences in the methodologies between estuarine microplastic studies limit the value of global assessments of estuarine microplastics.

Z.",,,,,"Heavy metal and pesticide pollution have become an inevitable part of the modern industrialized environment that find their way into all ecosystems. Because of their persistent nature, recalcitrance, high toxicity and biological enrichment, metal and pesticide pollution has threatened the stability of the environment as well as the health of living beings. Due to the environmental persistence of heavy metals and pesticides, they get accumulated in the environs and consequently lead to food chain contamination. Therefore, remediation of heavy metals and pesticide contaminations needs to be addressed as a high priority. Various physico-chemical approaches have been employed for this purpose, but they have significant drawbacks such as high expenses, high labor, alteration in soil properties, disruption of native soil microflora and generation of toxic by-products. Researchers worldwide are focusing on bioremediation strategies to overcome this multifaceted problem, i.e., the removal, immobilization and detoxification of pesticides and heavy metals, in the most efficient and cost-effective ways. For a period of millions of evolutionary years, microorganisms have become resistant to intoxicants and have developed the capability to remediate heavy metal ions and pesticides, and as a result, they have helped in the restoration of the natural state of degraded environs with long term environmental benefits. Keeping in view the environmental and health concerns imposed by heavy metals and pesticides in our society, we aimed to present a generalized picture of the bioremediation capacity of microorganisms. We explore the use of bacteria, fungi, algae and genetically engineered microbes for the remediation of both metals and pesticides. This review summarizes the major detoxification pathways and bioremediation technologies; in addition to that, a brief account is given of molecular approaches such as systemic biology, gene editing and omics that have enhanced the bioremediation process and widened its microbiological techniques toward the remediation of heavy metals and pesticides.",,10.3390/pr10071358,"Pesticides;Metals, Heavy",NA,,microbial remediation a promising tool for reclamation of contaminated sites with special emphasis on heavy metal and pesticide pollution a review

On the other hand, these pesticides are a double-edged sword because they have both acute effects and chronic adverse effects on human health. The widespread use of pesticides has led to their persistence in soil, water, and agricultural products, thus posing a serious threat to public health. Therefore, the removal and analysis of pesticides are critical to protecting human safety and health. When removing pesticides from the environment, it is imperative to ensure high removal efficiency while preventing secondary pollution to the environment. Because of the low concentrations of pesticide residue in the environment, complex matrix, and large throughput of pesticide residue analysis, a low-cost fast pre-treatment technique that has strong selectivity and an enrichment effect on the target pesticide residue, with little environmental impact, is required. Plant biomass-derived biochar is obtained from wheat straw, corn cob, rice husk, etc. This material has a large specific surface area, high pore capacity, tunable surface functional groups, and good environmental compatibility, which make it an inexpensive and efficient adsorbent. Hence, there is a need to systematically review the knowledge regarding the application of plant-based biochar on pesticide removal and pesticide residue analysis. This paper reviews the application progress of plant biomass-derived biochar in the above mentioned two areas over the last decade. The pesticide removal applications include reducing the mobility of pesticides in soil, eliminating the pollution caused by chiral pesticides, loading pesticide-degrading bacteria, and releasing fertilizers sustainably when removing pesticide. As mentioned above, plant biomass-derived biochar has a large specific surface area, a high number of functional groups on the surface, and good environmental compatibility. Therefore, it can effectively remove pesticides or their metabolites from the environment without causing any secondary pollution. During pre-treatment, plan biomass-derived biochar is used as an adsorbent for dispersive solid-phase extraction, solid-phase microextraction, and magnetic solid-phase extraction to selectively adsorb organophosphorus and triazole pesticides in fruits and vegetables, as well as organochlorine pesticides in the aquatic environment. This paper also introduces the adsorption mechanism of plant biomass-derived biochar, where studies based on computational simulations such as the density functional theory, molecular dynamics simulation, and giant canonical Monte Carlo simulation are carefully discussed. The benefits of adopting computational simulations are also mentioned. Finally, this paper summarizes the advantages and disadvantages of using plant biomass-derived biochar in pesticide removal and pre-treatment, as well as the future research trends in this area.",,10.3724/SP.J.1123.2021.10024,Pesticides;Plant Preparations,NA,,progress in preparation of plant biomassderived biochar and application in pesticide residues field

According to the latest statistics from the 2019 Global Burden of Disease Study, air pollution is the fourth leading cause of premature death and the largest environmental risk factor worldwide. After the implementation of air quality regulations and technological advances, air pollution levels have declined in recent decades. However, the dose–response relationship between the mass concentration of atmospheric particles and adverse effects is nonlinear. Refined pollution control measures that target key high-risk components in the atmosphere, rather than just particulate matter mass concentrations, may become more important for public health. It is very challenging to identify high-risk organic pollutants in the atmosphere because of the extreme complexity of atmospheric particulate matter components. Nontargeted analysis and suspect screening analysis offer analytical approaches for identifying unknown and unregulated organic compounds. Additional tools and strategies are needed to reduce the number of chemicals of interest and focus analytical efforts on chemicals that may pose high risks to humans and the environment. In this paper, we systematically review the methods and recent findings for screening of high-risk air pollutants: (1) Recognize novel air pollutants using advanced analytical techniques and conduct risk-based prioritization; (2) combine biological and chemical analysis tools to identify key risk drivers in complex atmospheric mixtures. This revealed some previously unknown hazardous pollutants in outdoor air, indoor air, and individual exposure samples. To tackle the persistent challenges of air pollution and enhance the understanding of the link between air pollution and human health, screening methods should be improved. This could be achieved through the development of a global platform for integrating and sharing atmospheric pollutant data, strengthening the integration and analysis of toxic compound data, using machine learning for multi-level mining of big data, and creating toxicological models with high-throughput assessment capabilities that closely resemble human tissues. To enhance our understanding of what we breathe affects our health, it is necessary to consider multiple factors comprehensively, such as mixed exposure effects, unknown toxicological targets, interactions between chemical and biological pollutants, and coupling with natural or social environmental exposure. It is also important to investigate human exposure to atmospheric particulate matters with a focus on susceptible populations and critical windows. The use of multiomics technologies, including genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiomics, to analyze the complex multilevel interactions of pollutants with humans has created the exciting new field of exposomics in which exposures are directly linked to disease causal pathways. It is necessary to build statistical analysis models, carry out toxicological simulations, and conduct intervention validation and policy evaluation around the key risk factors, so as to form a risk assessment system with strong causal relationship. Such studies are important for identifying air pollutants for priority control and concentrating efforts to carry out follow-up environmental behavior investigations and toxicity testing. © 2024 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Dissimilatory iron-reducing bacteria (DIRB) such as Shewanella and Geobacter have been applied to treat a wide range of halogenated organic compounds due to their specific biological properties. Until now, there has been no systematic review on the mechanisms of direct or indirect degradation of halogenated organic compounds by DIRB. This work summarizes the discussion of DIRB's ability to enhance the dechlorination of reaction systems through different pathways, both biological and biochemical. For biological dechlorination, some DIRB have self-dechlorination capabilities that directly dechlorinate by hydrolysis. Adjustment of dechlorination genes through genetic engineering can improve the dechlorination capabilities of DIRB. DIRB can also adjust the capacity for the microbial community to dechlorinate and provide nutrients to enhance the expression of dechlorination genes in other bacteria. In biochemical dechlorination, DIRB bioconverts Fe(III) to Fe(II), which is capable of dichlorination. On this basis, the DIRB-driven Fenton reaction can efficiently degrade chlorinated organics by continuously maintaining anoxic conditions to generate Fe(II) and oxic conditions to generate H2O2. DIRB can drive microbial fuel cells due to their electroactivity and have a good dechlorination capacity at low levels of energy consumption. The contribution of DIRB to the removal of pesticides, antibiotics and POPs is summarized. Then the DIRB electron transfer mechanism is discussed, which is core to their ability to dechlorinate. Finally, the prospect of future work on the removal of chlorine-containing organic pollutants by DIRB is presented, and the main challenges and further research directions are suggested. © 2024 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.

BDE-209 (2,2′,3,3′,4,4′,5,5′,6,6′-decabromodiphenyl ether) is an additive used as a flame retardant and classified as a persistent organic pollutant that has a high bioaccumulation capacity due to its lipophilic nature. This substance has already been detected in rivers, air, soil, plants and even in different human biological samples, such as plasma, umbilical cord blood and breast milk, revealing a great concern to human populations. Thus, in the current study we investigated whether prior exposure of murine melanoma B16–F1 cells to BDE-209 modulates in vivo progression and malignancy of melanoma. B16–F1 cells were cultured and exposed in vitro to BDE-209 (0.01, 0.1 e 1 nM) for 15 days and then inoculated, via caudal vein, in C57BL/6 mice for experimental metastasis analysis after 20 days. Inoculation of BDE-209-exposed cells resulted in 82% increase of metastasis colonized area in the lungs of mice, downregulation of tumor suppressors genes, such as Timp3 and Reck, decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of systemic and local inflammatory response. These findings are related to melanoma progression. Additionally, the histopathological analysis revealed greater number of focal points of metastases in the lungs and invasiveness of metastases to the mice brain (89%). The results showed that exposure to BDE-209 may alter the phenotype of B16–F1 cells, worsening their metastatic profile. Current data showed that BDE-209 may interfere with the prognosis of melanoma by modulating cells with less invasiveness capacity to a more aggressive profile. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.A.D.

The analysis of heavy metals in fish edible parts was performed by Q-ICP-MS and the risk assessment was estimated by the Hazard Quotient (HQ) and the Incremental Lifetime Cancer Risk (ILCR). There were statistical differences between two fish species for three heavy metals such as Cd, As, and Hg in muscle samples which were higher in Diplodus annularis. Nevertheless, no samples exceeded the legal limits set for Pb, Cd, and Hg. The HQs and ILCRs showed potential risks for exposure to As, Cd, and Hg concentrations above the median. However, the no speciation of As overestimated the risk probably.

The ideology of Fast Track-Surgery (FTS) and Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) represents modern trends in global surgical practice. Anesthesiology aims to provide ideal and universal solutions for protecting patients from surgical aggression. A multimodal approach, which includes multilevel, multifaceted antinociception, is well-founded, where maximum effectiveness is combined with minimal side effects. The aim. To analyze the issue of multimodal pain management as an important component of ERAS (Enhanced Recovery After Surgery) from modern sources of literature for optimizing perioperative care in the minimally invasive surgery department. Materials and methods. Bibliosemantic, comparative, and systemic analysis methods were employed. The proposed recommendations were developed based on an analysis of modern literature, the results of randomized trials and meta-analyses, as well as our own studies dedicated to the study of perioperative pain issues. The results. It has been proven that the use of opioids in anesthesia practice is decreasing. New and modern methods of continuous monitoring of vital organs in patients are being introduced as supplements to classical monitoring protocols. These methods are used to avoid excessive or inadequate dosing of anesthetics, adjust the concentration of substances used, reduce post-anesthesia complications, and improve patient comfort. The method of perioperative energy monitoring significantly complements the «International Standards for Safe Anesthetic Practice», WFSA (2010), and enhances perioperative patient safety by detecting metabolic disturbances and implementing appropriate pathogenetic correction. The importance of regional anesthesia under ultrasound control, nociception-antinociception balance management, and the impact of these methods on opioid consumption, patient satisfaction, and postoperative recovery have been proven. Conclusions. The most commonly used combination of drugs for multimodal analgesia often includes acetaminophen and NSAIDs (strong recommendation). It has been proven that deep and prolonged sedation in intensive care unit (ICU) patients is associated with worse outcomes, longer mechanical ventilation duration, extended ICU and hospital stays, and higher rates of complications, including infections and sometimes even death. © 2024, State Institution of Science ""Research and Practical Center of Preventive and Clinical Medicine"" State Administration Department.

Short-chain CPs (SCCPs) and medium-chain CPs (MCCPs) were listed as Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and candidate POPs under the Stockholm Convention, respectively. The present study explored the developmental toxicity and metabolic disruption caused by SCCPs and MCCPs in zebrafish (Danio rerio) larvae. CPs exposure at environmentally relevant levels caused no obvious phenotypic changes with zebrafish larvae except that the body length shortening was observed after exposure to CPs at 1–200 μg/L for 7 day post fertilization. A further metabolomic approach was conducted to explore the early biological responses of developmental toxicity induced by CPs at low dose (1, 5, and 10 μg/L). The results of metabolic disorder, pathway analysis and chronic values indicated that, compared with SCCPs, MCCPs exhibited more risks to zebrafish larvae at low doses. Lipid metabolism was markedly affected in SCCPs exposure group, whereas MCCPs primarily disturbed lipid metabolism, amino acid, and nucleotide metabolisms. Compare with SCCPs, the relatively higher lipid solubility, protein affinity and metabolic rate of MCCPs can probably explain why MCCP-mediated metabolic disruption was significantly higher than that of SCCP. Notably, SCCPs and MCCPs have the same potential to cause cancer, but no evidence indicates the mutagenicity. In summary, our study provides insight into the potential adverse outcome for SCCP and MCCP at low doses. © 2024","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: N.

Adsorption is selected as the optimal method due to its numerous benefits, which include greater efficacy, reduced cost, and convenient accessibility in comparison to alternative treatments. Biosorption using naturally occurring seaweeds can, however, remove contaminants from a variety of sources, including heavy metals, nitrogen, phosphorus, and phenolic compounds, and dyes from the paper, textile, and printing industries. Biosorption utilizing seaweed has surfaces as a feasible substitute for existing technologies in the effective elimination of these pollutants from effluent on account of its environmentally sustainable nature, readily available resources, and cost-effectiveness.

Silk fibroin has been used as a dressing in wound treatment for its physical, chemical, mechanical, and biological properties. This systematic review analyzed studies from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases to identify the molecules preferred for functionalizing silk fibroin-based dressings and to describe their mechanisms of exhibiting anti-inflammatory and antibacterial properties. The analysis of the selected articles allowed us to classify the dressings into different conformations, such as membranes, films, hydrogels, sponges, and bioadhesives. The incorporation of various molecules, including antibiotics, natural products, peptides, nanocomposites, nanoparticles, secondary metabolites, growth factors, and cytokines, has allowed the development of dressings that promote wound healing with antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties. In addition, silk fibroin-based dressings have been established to have the potential to regenerate wounds such as venous ulcers, arterial ulcers, diabetic foot, third-degree burns, and neoplastic ulcers. Evaluation of the efficacy of silk fibroin-based dressings in tissue engineering is an area of great activity that has shown significant advances in recent years. © 2024 The Author(s)","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.C.

Over the past few decades, photocatalytic reactions have drawn significant attention as a method to accelerate the otherwise slow degradation of these pollutants. The current study aims to evaluate the current efficacy of the photocatalytic method for degrading parabens in aqueous solutions. An extensive literature review and bibliometric analysis were conducted to identify key research trends and influential areas in the field of photocatalytic paraben degradation. Studies were screened based on the predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, which led to 13 studies that were identified as being appropriate for the meta-analysis using the random effects model. Furthermore, experimental parameters such as pH, paraben initial concentration, catalyst dosage, light intensity, and contact time have been reported to have key impacts on the performance of the photocatalytic degradation process. A comprehensive quantitative assessment of these parameters was carried out in this work. Overall, photocatalytic techniques could eliminate parabens with an average degradation efficiency of >80 %. The findings of the Egger's test and the Begg's test were statistically not significant suggesting potential publication bias was not observed. This review provides a holistic understanding of the photocatalytic degradation of parabens and is anticipated to encourage more widespread adoption of photocatalytic procedures as a suitable method for the elimination of parabens from aqueous solutions, opening new avenues for future research in this direction. © 2024","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.K.

They can be present in the natural environment, food, and many products of everyday origin, which suggests that human exposure to them is massive and universal. Therefore, the study of this type of substances is becoming one of the priority lines of research of the main agencies dedicated to the protection of public and environmental health, such as the World Health Organization (WHO), United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) or European Union (EU). In this sense, it is of vital importance to know the nature and quantity of this type of contaminants, to establish preventive mechanisms that minimize its presence in aquatic systems, with special requirements for human consumption. This study aimed to describe a protocol for a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the status of pesticides in European waters. We will search for original studies in the PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Web of Science, EMBASE, ScienceDirect databases. Prevalence studies of emerging contaminants (pesticides) in water resources (watersheds, aquifers, rivers, marine and springs), wastewaters (influent and effluent), and drinking water should be included. Two reviewers will independently screen and assess the included studies, with any disagreements being resolved by a third reviewer. We will summarize the findings using a narrative approach and, if possible, conduct a quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis). We will conduct the protocol following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P) guidelines. The review will summarize the current evidence on the presence of pesticides in European waters such as glyphosate, chlorpyrifos, pyrethroid pesticides, neonicotinoid pesticides, and/or fungicides, in samples of different water resources like wastewaters and drinking water.

Among wastewater treatment technologies, in the view of development of sustainable and environmentally friendly processes, membrane adsorption has proved to be a fast and simple method in the removal of pollutants, offering great contaminants recovery percentages, fast adsorbent regeneration and recycle, and easy scale-up. Due to their large surface area and tunable chemistry, carbon nanotubes (CNTs)-based materials revealed to be extraordinary adsorbents, exceeding by far performances of ordinary organic and inorganic membranes such as polyethersulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride, polytetrafluoroethylene, ceramics, currently employed in membrane technologies for wastewater treatment. In consideration of this, the review aims to summarize recent developments in the field of carbon nanotubes-based materials for pollutants recovery from water through adsorption processes. After a brief introduction concerning what adsorption phenomenon is and how it is performed and governed by using carbon nanotubes-based materials, the review discusses into detail the employment of three common typologies of CNTs-based materials (CNTs powders, CNTs-doped polymeric membranes and CNTs membranes) in adsorption process for the removal of water pollutants. Particularly focus will be devoted on the emergent category of self-standing CNTs membranes (buckypapers), made entirely of carbon nanotubes, exhibiting superior performances than CNTs and CNTs-doped polymeric membranes in terms of preparation strategy, recovery percentages of pollutants and regeneration possibilities.

However, to the best of our knowledge, no review has systematically examined the removal of MPs using adsorption or provided an in-depth discussion on various adsorbents. Adsorption is an inexpensive and effective technology for wastewater treatment. Recently, many researchers have conducted studies on MP remediation using diverse adsorbent materials, such as biochar, activated carbon, sponges, carbon nanotubes, metal-layered oxides, metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), and zeolites. Each adsorbent has advantages and disadvantages. To overcome their disadvantages, researchers have been designing and developing hybrid adsorbents for MP remediation. This review provides insights into these individual adsorbents and also discusses hybrid adsorbents for MP removal.

Statins have been shown to exhibit anti-inflammatory effects by modulating the inflammatory response. This study investigated whether statin treatment could reduce the risk of TB in patients with bronchiectasis. Methods We conducted a retrospective cohort study using a nationwide population database of patients with bronchiectasis who did or did not receive statin treatment. The defined daily dose (DDD) of statin, current or past statin user and statin exposure time were measured for the impact of statin use. The primary outcome was the incidence of new-onset TB. Considering of potential immortal time bias due to stain exposure time, Cox regression models with time-dependent covariates were employed to estimate HRs with 95% CIs for TB incidence among patients with bronchiectasis. Results Patients with bronchiectasis receiving statin treatment had a decreased risk of TB. After adjusting for age, sex, income, comorbidities and Charlson Comorbidity Index, statin users had a 0.59-fold lower risk of TB incidence compared with non-statin users (95% CI 0.40 to 0.88; p=0.0087). Additionally, compared with non-statin users, statin treatment was a protective factor against TB in users with a cumulative DDD greater than 180 per year, with an HR of 0.32 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.87; p=0.0255). Conclusions Statin treatment demonstrated a dose-dependent protective effect and was associated with a reduced risk of TB in patients with bronchiectasis. These findings suggest that statins may play a role in lowering TB risk by modulating airway inflammation in this patient population. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: C.-C.

In this study, we investigated the microbial dechlorination kinetics under different TCE-Cr(Ⅲ/VI) composite pollution conditions and elucidated microbial response mechanisms based on community shift patterns and metagenomic analysis. Our results revealed that the reductive dechlorinating consortium had high resistance to Cr(III) but extreme sensitivity to Cr(VI) disturbance, resulting in a persistent inhibitory effect on subsequent dechlorination. Interestingly, the vinyl chloride-respiring organohalide-respiring bacteria (OHRB) was notably more susceptible to Cr(III/VI) exposure than the trichloroethene-respiring one, possibly due to inferior competition for growth substrates, such as electron donors. In terms of synergistic non-OHRB populations, Cr(III/VI) exposure had limited impacts on lactate fermentation but significantly interfered with H2-producing acetogenesis, leading to inhibited microbial dechlorination due to electron donor deficiencies. However, this inhibition can be effectively mitigated by the amendment of exogenous H2 supply. Furthermore, being the predominant OHRB, Dehalococcoides have inherent Cr(VI) resistance defects and collaborate with synergistic non-OHRB populations to achieve concurrent bio-detoxication of Cr(VI) and TCE.

This study achieved an anaerobic enrichment culture capable of reductively dehalogenating TBBPA to the more bioavailable bisphenol A. 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing and quantitative PCR confirmed that successive dehalogenation of four bromide ions from TBBPA was coupled with the growth of both Dehalobacter sp. and Dehalococcoides sp. with growth yields of 5.0 ± 0.4 × 108 and 8.6 ± 4.6 × 108 cells per μmol Br- released (N = 3), respectively. TBBPA dehalogenation was facilitated by solid humin and reduced humin, which possessed the highest organic radical signal intensity and reducing groups −NH2, and maintained the highest dehalogenation rate and dehalogenator copies. Genome-centric metatranscriptomic analyses revealed upregulated putative TBBPA-dehalogenating rdhA (reductive dehalogenase) genes with humin amendment, cprA-like Dhb_rdhA1 gene in Dehalobacter species, and Dhc_rdhA1/Dhc_rdhA2 genes in Dehalococcoides species. The upregulated genes of lactate fermentation, de novo corrinoid biosynthesis, and extracellular electron transport in the humin amended treatment also stimulated TBBPA dehalogenation.

Limited, Suzhou, 215003, China""]","Ethnopharmacological relevance: Bufei Huoxue capsule (BHC) as a classic Chinese patent medicine formula, has the efficacy of tonifying the lungs and activating the blood. It has been extensively used in China for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) clinically. However, its mechanism is still unclear, which hampers the applications of BHC in treating COPD. Aim of the study: The purpose of the present study was to demonstrate the protective efficacy and mechanism of BHC on COPD model rats by integrating serum metabolomics analysis and network pharmacology study. Materials and methods: A COPD rat model was established by cigarette fumigation combined with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) airway drip for 90 consecutive days. After oral administration for 30 days, the rats were placed in the body tracing box of the EMKA Small Animal Noninvasive Lung Function Test System to determine lung function related indexes. Histopathological alteration was observed by H&E staining and Masson staining. The serum levels of inflammatory cytokine, matrix metalloprotein 9, and laminin were determined by ELISA kits. Oxidative stress levels were tested by biochemical methods. UHPLC-Q-TOF/MS analysis of serum metabolomics and network pharmacology were performed to reveal the bioactive metabolites, key components and pathways for BHC treating COPD. WB and ELISA kits were used to verify the effects of BHC on key pathway. Results: BHC could improve lung function, immunity, lung histopathological changes and collagen deposition in COPD model rats. It also could significantly reduce inflammatory response in vivo, regulate oxidative stress level, reduce laminin content, and regulate protease-antiprotease balance. Metabolomics analysis found 46 biomarkers of COPD, of which BHC significantly improved the levels of 23 differential metabolites including arachidonic acid, leukotriene B4 and prostaglandin E2. Combined with the results of network pharmacology, the components of BHC, such as calycosin, oxypaeoniflora, (S)-bavachin and neobavaisoflavone could play therapeutic roles through the arachidonic acid pathway. In addition, the results of WB and ELISA indicated that BHC could suppress the expressions of COX2 and 5-LOX in lung tissues and inhibit the generation of AA and its metabolites in serum samples. Regulation of arachidonic acid metabolic pathway may be the crucial mechanism for BHC treating COPD. Conclusions: In summary, the studies indicated that BHC exhibited the protective effect on COPD model rats by anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidative properties through arachidonic acid metabolism pathway. This study provided beneficial support for the applications of BHC in treating COPD. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

However, studies addressing brownfield risks from the perspective of climate change have received limited attention. Nonetheless, the detrimental consequences of brownfield risks are intrinsically linked to strategies for mitigating and adapting to sustainable urban development, emphasizing the critical importance of their far-reaching implications. This relevance extends to concerns about environmental quality, safety, health risks, and the efficacy of chosen regeneration strategies, including potential secondary pollution risks. This comprehensive review systematically surveys pertinent articles published between 1998 and 2023. A selective analysis was conducted on 133 articles chosen for their thematic relevance. The findings reveal that: (1) Under the backdrop of the climate change process, brownfield restoration is necessitated to provide scientific and precise guidance. The integration of brownfield considerations with the dynamics of climate change has progressively evolved into a unified framework, gradually shaping a research paradigm characterized by “comprehensive + multi-scale + quantitative” methodologies; (2) Research themes coalesce into five prominent clusters: “Aggregation of Brownfield Problem Analysis”, “Precision Enhancement of Brownfield Identification through Information Technology”, “Diversification of Brownfield Reutilization Assessment”, “Process-Oriented Approaches to Brownfield Restoration Strategies”, and “Expansion of Ecological Service Functions in Brownfield Contexts”; (3) Application methodologies encompass five key facets: “Temporal and Spatial Distribution Patterns of Pollutants”, “Mechanisms and Correlations of Pollution Effects”, “Evaluation of Pollution Risks”, “Assessment of Brownfield Restoration Strategies”, and “Integration of Brownfield Regeneration with Spatial Planning”. Future brownfield research from the climate change perspective is poised to reflect characteristics such as “High-Precision Prediction, Comprehensive Dimensionality, Full-Cycle Evaluation, Low-Risk Exposure, and Commitment to Sustainable Development”. © 2024 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.

Objective: The objective of this systematic review was to investigate the role of kefir against inflammation and the main response mechanisms involved in this process in a murine model. Data Sources: The searches were searched in the PubMed, Science Direct, and LILACS databases. Only murine model studies, according to PRISMA guidelines, published in the past 10 years were included. Study Selection: Only articles about original and placebo-controlled experiments in murine models used to investigate the anti-inflammatory mechanisms of kefir were considered. Of the articles found, 349 were excluded according to the following criteria: duplicate articles (n = 99), off-Topic title and abstract (n = 157), reviews (n = 47), studies in vitro (n = 29), and studies with humans (n = 17). In total, 23 studies were included in this review. Data Extraction: Two independently working authors assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. Results: Kefir consumption had positive effects on inflammation modulation. The main mechanisms involved were the reduction of pro-inflammatory and molecular markers; reduction in inflammatory infiltrate in tissues, serum biomarkers, risk factors for chronic diseases, and parasitic infection; composition and metabolic activity change of intestinal microbiota and mycobiota; activation of humoral and cellular immunity; and modulation of oxidative stress. Conclusions: Kefir modulates the immune system in different experimental models, among other secondary outcomes, to improve overall health. The beverage reduces inflammation through the alternation between innate, Th1, and Th2 responses, reducing levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines while increasing those of anti-inflammatory ones. In addition, it also mediates immunomodulatory and protective effects through the numerous molecular biomarkers and organic acids produced and secreted by kefir in the intestinal microbiota. The health-promoting effects attributed to kefir may help in the different treatments of inflammatory, chronic, and infectious diseases in the population.  © 2023 The Author(s).

It is a material that has a low cost production and vast options of applicability, among the most explored are: recovery of soils degraded by agricultural activities and sorption of contaminants through the bioremediation of polluted areas. Thus, this material aims to demonstrate the production and characterization of biochar, and discuss its applications for soil improvement and reduction of the concentration of toxic and harmful substances, such as textile dyes and heavy metals, improperly disposed of in the environment, all this from the selection of relevant references that address clearly and consistently the application of biochar and its effects. From the analyzed works it was found that biochar exerts a high sorption power of a variety of emerging pollutants, such as: pharmaceuticals, pesticides, textile dyes and heavy metals, retaining, in some applications, up to 90% of the original concentration of the contaminant. Furthermore, biochar is one of the main alternatives for the recovery of soils exploited for long periods as cultivated or pasture areas, obtaining, for the vast majority of biochar applications, the improvement of soil properties, such as: pH, nutrient retention and carbon content. Therefore, biochar is a carbonaceous material with high productive viability and great efficiency in bioremediation processes and recovery of degraded areas. © 2024, Universidade Federal de Pernambuco.

Pars plana vitrectomy (PPV) with gas tamponade is often performed to repair primary macula-involving RRDs with a high rate of anatomical retinal reattachment. It has been advocated by some ophthalmologists that face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade helps reduce postoperative retinal displacement. Retinal displacement can cause metamorphopsia and binocular diplopia. Objectives: The primary objective of this review is to determine whether face-down positioning reduces the risk of retinal displacement following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register) (2022, Issue 11), MEDLINE (January 1946 to 28 November 2022), Embase.com (January 1947 to 28 November 2022), PubMed (1948 to 28 November 2022), Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences Literature database (1982 to 28 November 2022), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform. We did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search. We last searched the electronic databases on 28 November 2022. Selection criteria: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) in which face-down positioning was compared with no positioning or another form of positioning following PPV and gas tamponade for primary macula-involving RRDs. Data collection and analysis: We used standard Cochrane methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the prespecified outcomes using the GRADE approach. Main results: We identified three RCTs (369 eyes of 368 participants) that met the eligibility criteria. Two RCTs provided data on postoperative retinal displacement, one reported on postoperative distortion and quality of life outcomes, two on postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in logMAR, and two on postoperative ocular adverse events such as outer retinal folds. Study characteristics and risk of bias. All the trials involved predominantly male participants (range: 68% to 72%). Only one trial provided race and ethnicity information, was registered on a trial registry, and reported funding sources. Using the RoB 2 tool, we assessed the risk of bias for proportion of eyes with retinal displacement, mean change in visual acuity, objective distortion scores, quality of life assessments, and ocular adverse events, with most domains judged to be at low risk of bias. Findings. Immediate face-down positioning may result in a lower proportion of participants with postoperative retinal displacement compared with support-the-break positioning at six months (risk ratio [RR] 0.73, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.54 to 0.99; 1 RCT; 239 eyes of 239 participants; very low certainty evidence). One study found no evidence of a difference in BCVA at three months when comparing postoperative face-up with face-down positioning with or without perfluorocarbon liquid (mean difference [MD] −0.03, 95% CI −0.09 to 0.02; I2 = 0; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). Immediate face-down positioning appears to have little to no effect on postoperative distortion scores at week 26 (MD 1.80, 95% CI −1.92 to 5.52; 1 RCT; 219 eyes of 219 participants; very low certainty evidence) and postoperative quality of life assessment scores at week 26 (MD −1.80, 95% CI −5.52 to 1.92; 1 RCT; 217 eyes of 217 participants; very low certainty evidence). Adverse events. One study that enrolled 262 participants with macula-involving RRDs suggested that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may reduce the ocular adverse event of postoperative outer retinal folds at six months (RR 0.39, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) and binocular diplopia (RR 0.20, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.90; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence) compared with support-the-break positioning. Immediate face-down positioning may increase the ocular adverse event of elevated intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning (RR 1.74, 95% CI 1.11 to 2.73; 1 RCT; 262 eyes of 262 participants; very low certainty evidence). Another study found no evidence of a difference in postoperative outer retinal folds when comparing face-down versus face-up positioning at one and three months (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.50 to 2.02; RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.28 to 3.61; 1 RCT; 56 eyes of 56 participants; very low certainty evidence). No studies reported non-ocular adverse events. Authors' conclusions: Very low certainty evidence suggests that immediate face-down positioning after PPV and gas tamponade may result in a reduction in postoperative retinal displacement, outer retinal folds, and binocular diplopia, but may increase the chance of postoperative raised intraocular pressure compared with support-the-break positioning at six months. We identified two ongoing trials that compare face-down positioning with face-up positioning following PPV and gas tamponade in participants with primary macula-involving RRDs, whose results may provide relevant evidence for our stated objectives. Future trials should be rigorously designed, and investigators should analyze outcome data appropriately and report adequate information to provide evidence of high certainty. Quality of life and patient preferences should be examined in addition to clinical and adverse event outcomes.  Copyright © 2024 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This study aims to provide a comprehensive overview of biomechanical research on the treatment of intertrochanteric fractures using cephalomedullary devices. Methods: Following the PRISMA-P guidelines, a systematic literature search was performed on 31.12.2022. The databases PubMed/MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched. Scientific papers published between 01.01.2000 – 31.12.2022 were included when they reported data on implant properties related to the biomechanical stability for intertrochanteric fractures. Data extraction was undertaken using a synthesis approach, gathering data on criteria of implants, sample size, fracture type, bone material, and study results. Results: The initial search identified a total of 1459 research papers, out of which forty-three papers were considered for final analysis. Due to the heterogeneous methods and parameters used in the included studies, meta-analysis was not feasible. A comprehensive assessment of implant characteristics and outcome parameters was conducted through biomechanical analysis. Various factors such as proximal and distal locking, nail diameter and length, fracture model, and bone material were thoroughly evaluated. Conclusion: This scoping review highlights the need for standardization in biomechanical studies on intertrochanteric fractures to ensure reliable and comparable results. Strategies such as avoiding varus, maintaining a sufficient tip-apex-distance, cement augmentation, and optimizing lesser trochanteric osteosynthesis enhance construct stability. Synthetic alternatives may offer advantages over cadaveric bone. Further research and meta-analyses are required to establish standardized protocols and enhance reliability. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

Nitrous acid (HONO) is an emerging indoor pollutant, and its indoor mixing ratios are usually higher than outdoor levels, ranging from a few to tens of parts per billion (ppb). HONO exhibits adverse effects to human health due to its respiratory toxicity and mutagenicity. Additionally, HONO can easily undergo photodissociation by ultraviolet light to produce hydroxyl radicals (OH•), which in turn trigger a series of further photochemical oxidation reactions of primary or secondary pollutants. The accumulation of indoor HONO can be attributed to both direct emissions from combustion sources, such as cooking, and secondary formation resulting from enhanced heterogeneous reactions of NOx on indoor surfaces. During the day, the primary sink of indoor HONO is photolysis to OH• and NO. Moreover, adsorption and/or reaction on indoor surfaces, and diffusion to the outside atmosphere contribute to HONO loss both during the day and at night. The level of indoor HONO is also affected by human occupancy, which can influence household factors such as temperature, humidity, light irradiation, and indoor surfaces. This comprehensive review article summarized the research progress on indoor HONO pollution based on indoor air measurements, laboratory studies, and model simulations.

Jindal Global University, Haryana, Sonipat, 131001, India","Surging incidents of air quality-related public health hazards, and environmental degradation, have prompted the global authorities to seek newer avenues of air quality monitoring, especially in developing economies, where the situation appears most alarming besides difficulties around ‘adequate’ deployment of air quality sensors. In the present narrative, we adopt a systematic review methodology (PRISMA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) around recent global literature (2002–2022), around moss-based passive biomonitoring approaches which might offer the regulatory authorities a complementary means to fill ‘gaps’ in existing air quality records. Following the 4-phased search procedure under PRISMA, total of 123 documents were selected for review. A wealth of research demonstrates how passive biomonitoring, with strategic use of mosses, could become an invaluable regulatory (and research) tool to monitor atmospheric deposition patterns and help identifying the main drivers of air quality changes (e.g., anthropogenic and/or natural). Besides individual studies, we briefly reflect on the European Moss Survey, underway since 1990, which aptly showcases mosses as ‘naturally occurring’ sensors of ambient air quality for a slew of metals (heavy and trace) and persistent organic pollutants, and help assessing spatio-temporal changes therein. To that end, we urge the global research community to conduct targeted research around various pollutant uptake mechanisms by mosses (e.g., species-specific interactions, environmental conditions, land management practices). Of late, mosses have found various environmental applications as well, such as in epidemiological investigations, identification of pollutant sources and transport mechanisms, assessment of air quality in diverse and complex urban ecosystems, and even detecting short-term changes in ambient air quality (e.g., COVID-19 Lockdown), each being critical for the authorities to develop informed and strategic regulatory measures. To that end, we review current literature and highlight to the regulatory authorities how to extend moss-based observations, by integrating them with a wide range of ecological indicators to assess regional environmental vulnerability/risk due to degrading air quality. Overall, an underlying motive behind this narrative was to broaden the current regulatory outlook and purview, to bolster and diversify existing air quality monitoring initiatives, by coupling the moss-based outputs with the traditional, sensor-based datasets, and attain improved spatial representation. However, we also make a strong case of conducting more targeted research to fill in the ‘gaps’ in our current understanding of moss-based passive biomonitoring details, with increased case studies. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature B.V. 2023.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: S.

Owing to their favorable attributes, including uncomplicated isolation protocols, ethical compliance, and ease of procurement, MSCs have become a focal point of inquiry in the domains of regenerative medicine and tissue engineering. As age increases or ex vivo cultivation is prolonged, the functionality of MSCs decreases and their stemness gradually diminishes, thereby limiting their potential therapeutic applications. Despite the existence of several uncertainties surrounding the comprehension of MSC stemness, considerable advancements have been achieved in the clarification of the potential mechanisms that lead to stemness loss, as well as the associated strategies for stemness maintenance. This comprehensive review provides a systematic overview of the factors influencing the preservation of MSC stemness, the molecular mechanisms governing it, the strategies for its maintenance, and the therapeutic potential associated with stemness. Finally, we underscore the obstacles and prospective avenues in present investigations, providing innovative perspectives and opportunities for the preservation and therapeutic utilization of MSC stemness.

Many metals and toxic elements, along with poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) are known to induce immunomodulation and have previously been linked to increased pathogen prevalence and infectious disease severity. In this study, the house sparrow (Passer domesticus) was investigated at the coast of Helgeland in northern Norway. This population is commonly infected with the parasitic nematode “gapeworm” (Syngamus trachea), with a prevalence of 40–60 % during summer months. Gapeworm induces severe respiratory disease in birds and has been previously demonstrated to decrease survival and reproductive success in wild house sparrows. The aim of this study was to investigate whether a higher exposure to pollution with PFASs, metals and other elements influences gapeworm infection in wild house sparrows. We conducted PFASs and elemental analysis on whole blood from 52 house sparrows from Helgeland, including analyses of highly toxic metals such as lead (Pb), mercury (Hg) and arsenic (As). In addition, we studied gapeworm infection load by counting the parasite eggs in faeces from each individual. We also studied the expression of microRNA 155 (miR155) as a key regulator in the immune system. Elevated blood concentrations of Pb were found to be associated with an increased prevalence of gapeworm infection in the house sparrow. The expression of miR155 in the plasma of the house sparrow was only weakly associated with Pb. In contrast, we found relatively low PFASs concentrations in the house sparrow blood (∑ PFASs 0.00048–354 μg/L) and PFASs were not associated to miR155 nor infection rate. The current study highlights the potential threat posed by Pb as an immunotoxic pollutant in small songbirds. © 2024","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: E.A.

Thus, it is paramount to explore remediation technologies aimed at decomposing and complete elimination of the toxic contaminants from pharmaceutical wastewater. The review aims to explore the utilization of metal-oxide nanoparticles (MONPs) and graphitic carbon nitrides (g-C3N4) in photocatalytic degradation of sulfonamides from wastewater. Recent advances in oxidation techniques such as photocatalytic degradation are being exploited in the elimination of the sulfonamides from wastewater. MONP and g-C3N4 are commonly evolved nano substances with intrinsic properties. They possessed nano-scale structure, considerable porosity semi-conducting properties, responsible for decomposing wide range of water pollutants. They are widely applied for photocatalytic degradation of organic and inorganic substances which continue to evolve due to the low-cost, efficiency, less toxicity, and more environmentally friendliness of the materials.

Since the opioid epidemic there is an interest in determining the opioid misuse potential in these patients. Therefore, the primary objective of this study is to determine the rates of opioid misuse among patients with SCD by assessing the rate of unexpected drug screening results in a sickle cell disease clinic. Methods: This was a retrospective chart review study conducted at the outpatient sickle cell disease clinic. The primary independent variables were the prescribed opioid medications while the primary dependent variable was the collected opioid metabolite. Descriptive statistics, linear regression and multivariate logistic regression analysis were conducted using SPSS version 24. Results: A total of 100 participants were recruited from July 1, 2018, to June 30, 2020 with 71 included in the analysis. The total mean of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) for all participants was 71.1±104.9 with 71% of participants having a daily calculated MME of <90MME. The odds of misusing an opioid were 6.72 times higher (P<.02) if a participant used marijuana compared to a participant who didn’t. In addition, the odds of misusing an opioid were 2.47 times higher (P<.04) if the patient was prescribed an opioid daily dose greater than 90 MME as opposed to a daily dose less than 90 MME. Conclusion: Participants who consumed greater than 90 MME’s per day and utilized marijuana were more likely to misuse opioids. © The Author(s) 2022.",Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; CODEN: JPPRE,10.1177/08971900221128335,"opioid misuse;pain management;sickle cell disease;Acute Pain;Analgesics, Opioid;Anemia, Sickle Cell;Cannabis;Endrin;Humans;Opioid-Related Disorders;Pain Management;Retrospective Studies;glutamine;hemoglobin beta chain;hemoglobin S;hydroxyurea;ibuprofen;morphine;naproxen;opiate;voxelotor;cannabis;endrin;MME;narcotic analgesic agent;adult;analgesia;Article;buccal swab;drug misuse;drug urine level;epidemic;ethnicity;female;genotype;human;insurance;major clinical study;male;morphine equivalent dose;opiate addiction;pain;prescription;retrospective study;sickle cell anemia;sickle cell crisis;urban area;procedures",NA,,rates of opioid misuse amongst patients receiving pain management for sickle cell disease in an urban setting

As the control of conventional PFASs, fluoroalkylether substances (ether-PFASs) as alternatives are constantly emerging. Subsequently, the three representative ether-PFASs, chlorinated polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic acid (F-53B), hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA), and 4,8-Dioxa-3H-perfluorononanoicacid (ADONA) are discovered and have received more attention in the environment and ecosystem. But their security is now also being challenged. This review systematically assesses their security from six dimensions including environmental occurrence in water, soil and atmosphere, as well as bioaccumulation and risk in plants, animals and humans. High substitution level is observed for F-53B, whether in environment or living things. Like PFOS or even more extreme, F-53B exhibits high biomagnification ability, transmission efficiency from maternal to infant, and various biological toxicity effects. HFPO-DA still has a relatively low substitution level for PFOA, but its use has emerged in Europe. Although it is less detected in human bodies and has a higher metabolic rate than PFOA, the strong migration ability of HFPO-DA in plants may pose dietary safety concerns for humans. Research on ADONA is limited, and currently, it is detected in Germany frequently while remaining at trace levels globally. Evidently, F-53B has shown increasing risk both in occurrence and toxicity compared to PFOS, and HFPO-DA is relatively safe based on available data. There are still knowledge gaps on security of alternatives that need to be addressed. © 2024","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

Despite WWTPs' efforts to mitigate PFAS impact through physicochemical and biological means, concerns persist regarding PFAS retention in generated biosolids. While numerous review studies have explored the fate of these compounds within WWTPs, no study has critically reviewed their presence, transformation mechanisms, and partitioning within the sludge. Therefore, the current study has been specifically designed to investigate these aspects. Studies show variations in PFAS concentrations across WWTPs, highlighting the importance of aqueous-to-solid partitioning, with sludge from PFOS and PFOA-rich wastewater showing higher concentrations. Research suggests biological mechanisms such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenase, transamine metabolism, and beta-oxidation are involved in PFAS biotransformation, though the effects of precursor changes require further study. Carbon chain length significantly affects PFAS partitioning, with longer chains leading to greater adsorption in sludge. The wastewater's organic and inorganic content is crucial for PFAS adsorption; for instance, higher sludge protein content and divalent cations like calcium and magnesium promote adsorption, while monovalent cations like sodium impede it. In conclusion, these discoveries shed light on the complex interactions among factors affecting PFAS behavior in biosolids. They underscore the necessity for thorough considerations in managing PFAS presence and its impact on environmental systems. © 2024 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: A.

The remarkable neoantigen intratumor heterogeneity observed in metastases is associated with decreased T cell reactivity, resulting from disruptions to neoantigen presentation. We identify somatic copy number alterations as highly selected events driving metastasis. Subclones without Wnt mutations show a stronger selective advantage for metastasis than those with Wnt mutations and are characterized by a microenvironment rich in activated fibroblasts favoring a pro-metastatic phenotype.

However, PFC as a temporary tamponade agent has been limited due to its high potential for toxicity. Main body: We conducted a scoping review regarding the use of PFC in vitreoretinal surgery as a temporary tamponade in subjects with severe ocular trauma or severe retinal detachment who received a therapeutic intervention (vitrectomy via posterior approach with the use of PFC as a temporary tamponade), compared to vitrectomy without the use of PFC as a temporary tamponade. Outcomes of interest were retinal reattachment, visual acuity (VA), postoperative complications and retinal toxicity. The search was performed in Medline, Medline In-Process & Other Non-Indexed Citations, Medline Daily Update, Embase databases. Reference lists from relevant review articles were also included. Two hundred thirty-eight studies were found, with no duplicate entries. In the first selection, 230 articles were eliminated; in the second selection, 6 additional articles were discarded. In total, 8 articles were obtained in this review. Two selected articles corresponded to animal studies and 6 to studies in humans. Regarding study design, 5 were case series, and 1 was a cohort study. Conclusion: PFC as a short-term tamponade had high rates of reapplication, improved VA, and the most frequent adverse effects were reversible after PFC withdrawal. Nonetheless, the quality of the studies was poor.

While government-initiated population-level interventions are fundamental in addressing this issue, their full potential remains to be explored. This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness of such interventions in reducing inappropriate antibiotic use among antibiotic providers and users in healthcare and community settings. Methods We will conduct a systematic literature search across multiple databases and grey literature sources. We will include studies which evaluate the effectiveness of population-level interventions to reduce inappropriate antibiotic use in healthcare and community settings in both high-income and low- and middle-income countries. This includes government-initiated measures targeting antibiotic use through education, restriction, incentivization, coercion, training, persuasion, context modification, behavior modeling, or barrier reduction. Two reviewers will independently perform screening to select eligible studies, followed by data extraction. The outcomes of interest are various measures of antibiotic prescription and consumption, such as Defined Daily Dose (DDD) or number of prescriptions per year. We anticipate including a broad range of study designs and outcome measures. Therefore, we will narratively synthesize results using the categories of the population-level policy interventions of the Behavior Change Wheel Framework. We will organize outcome data by economic contexts, target populations, and implementation settings. Discussion This review will strengthen the evidence base for the use of population-level interventions to address inappropriate antibiotic use. Drawing lessons from global experiences, the findings will provide valuable guidance to health policymakers, public health authorities, and researchers on tailoring interventions to specific economic contexts, populations, and settings, thereby enhancing their capacity to drive substantial improvement in appropriate antibiotic use. © 2024 Wu et al.

The usual recommendation for the selection of the lowest instrumented vertebra (LIV) for double major or thoracolumbar/lumbar (TL/L) curves falls on L3 or L4. The aim of the present study is to assess if the spinal fusion with LIV selection of L3 or L4 in AIS patients has a clinical or radiological impact in terms of degenerative disc disease (DDD) in distal unfused segments at long-term follow-up. Methods: A systematic search of electronic databases from eligible articles was conducted. Only studies regarding long-term follow-up of AIS patients treated with spinal fusion were included. Clinical and radiographic outcomes were extracted and summarized. Meta-analysis on long-term follow-up MRI studies was performed. p value < 0.05 was considered significant. Results: Fourteen studies were included, for a total of 1264 patients. Clinical assessment of included patients showed a slight tendency to have worse clinical outcomes if spinal fusion is extended to L4 rather than L3. Despite that, meta-analysis could not be performed on clinical parameters because of heterogeneity of evaluated PROMs in included studies. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluation at long-term follow-up showed no significant difference in terms of disc degeneration rate at overall meta-analysis (p = 0.916) between patients fused to L3 and L4. Conclusion: The LIV selection of L3 rather than L4, according to current literature, does not prevent disc degeneration in distal unfused segments over the long term.

The large amount of fluorine flue gas produced by it contributes to tremendous pressure on the environment. When the concentration of PFCs in the environment reaches a certain value, it will cause damage to the central nervous system and liver of human body. The treatment method of perfluorocarbon (PFCs) is mainly based on source or end-of-pipe control, with the former having low emissions and low energy consumption and the latter having high removal rate. However, reviews of the formation mechanism and influencing factors of PFCs has seldom been conducted. Therefore, it is very important to comprehensively understand the formation mechanism and treatment status of PFCs, finding effective and rational processing technologies in the electrolytic aluminum industry for realizing effective control. This paper provides a more systematic review of the micro-formation mechanism of PFCs, pollutant source management, and ultimate pollution and carbon reduction.

Among the bioassay endpoints, (anti)oestrogenic and (anti)androgenic activities were selected because are the most studied endocrine activities. A total of 24 articles were ultimately included in this review. Despite evidences are still scarce, the results showed that PM can induce oestrogenic, antioestrogenic, androgenic and antiandrogenic effects, suggesting that PM has an endocrine disrupting potential that should be considered because it could represent a further source of exposure to EDs. Although it is difficult to estimate how much inhalation can contribute to the total burden of EDs, endocrine activity of PM may increase the human health risk. Finally, the results pointed out that the overall endocrine activity is difficult to predict from the concentrations of individual pollutants, so the assessment using bioassays could be a valuable additional tool to quantify the health risk posed by EDs in air. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

Design/methodology/approach: Pollutants and pollution levels are becoming an increasing cause for concern within the LAC region, primarily because of the rapid increase in urbanization and the use of fossil fuels. The rise in indoor and outdoor air pollutants impacts public health, and there are limited regional studies on the impact of these pollutants and how they affect public health. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, EBSCOhost, Web of Science and ScienceDirect databases. Significant search terms included “indoor air pollution,” “outdoor air pollution,” “pollution,” “Latin America,” “Central America,” “South America” and “Caribbean was used.” The systematic review utilized the Rayyan systematic software for uploading and sorting study references. Findings: Database searches produced 1,674 results, of which, after using the inclusion–exclusion criteria and assessing for bias, 16 studies were included and used for the systematic review. These studies covered both indoor and outdoor pollution. Various indoor and outdoor air pollutants linked to low birth weight, asthma, cancer and DNA impairment were reported in this review. Even though only some intervention programs are available within the region to mitigate the harmful effects of pollution, these programs need to be robust and appropriately implemented, causing possible threats to public health. Significant gaps in the research were identified, especially in the Caribbean. Research limitations/implications: Limitations of the study include limited available research done within LAC, with most of the research quantifying pollutants rather than addressing their impacts. Additionally, most studies focus on air pollution but neglect water and land pollution’s effects on public health. For this reason, the 16 studies included limited robustness of the review. Originality/value: Although available studies quantifying pollution threats in LAC were identified in this review, research on the adverse impacts of pollution, especially concerning public health, is limited. LAC countries should explore making cities more energy-efficient, compact and green while improving the transportation sector by utilizing clean power generation. In order to properly lessen the effects of pollution on public health, more research needs to be done and implemented programs that are working need to be strengthened and expanded. © 2023, Danladi Chiroma Husaini, Kemberly Manzur and Jorge Medrano.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: D.C.

On 9 November 2022, Tufts University's Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy and the school's Food and Nutrition Innovation Institute hosted a 1-d meeting to explore the evidence and evidence gaps regarding the relationships between food, nutrition, and fertility. Topics addressed included male fertility, female fertility and gestation, and intergenerational effects. This meeting report summarizes the presentations and deliberations from the meeting. Regarding male fertility, a positive association exists with a healthy dietary pattern, with high-quality evidence for semen quality and lower quality evidence for clinical outcomes. Folic acid and zinc supplementation have been found to not impact male fertility. In females, body weight status and other nutrition-related factors are linked to nearly half of all ovulation disorders, a leading cause of female infertility. Females with obesity have worse fertility treatment, pregnancy-related, and birth outcomes. Environmental contaminants found in food, water, or its packaging, including lead, perfluorinated alkyl substances, phthalates, and phenols, adversely impact female reproductive outcomes. Epigenetic research has found that maternal and paternal dietary-related factors can impact outcomes for future generations. Priority evidence gaps identified by meeting participants relate to the effects of nutrition and dietary patterns on fertility, gaps in communication regarding fertility optimization through changes in nutritional and environmental exposures, and interventions impacting germ cell mechanisms through dietary effects. Participants developed research proposals to address the priority evidence gaps. The workshop findings serve as a foundation for future prioritization of scientific research to address evidence gaps related to food, nutrition, and fertility. © 2023","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: D.

Foam fractionation has emerged as a viable method for removing and concentrating PFAS from aqueous matrices. The method exploits the surface-active nature of the PFAS to adsorb at the air-liquid interfaces of rising air bubbles, resulting in foam formation at the top of a foam fractionator. The removal of PFAS is then achieved through foam harvesting. Foam fractionation has gained increasing attention owing to its inherent advantages, including simplicity and low operational costs. The coupling of foam fractionation with destructive technologies could potentially serve as a comprehensive treatment train for future PFAS management in aqueous matrices. The PFAS-enriched foam, which has a smaller volume, can be directed to subsequent destructive treatment technologies. In this review, we delve into previous experiences with foam fractionation for PFAS removal from various aqueous matrices and critically analyse their key findings. Then, the recent industry advancements and commercial projects that utilise this technology are identified.

These impacts include the infiltration of organic contaminants into soil, water, and air, posing a threat to the environment and public health. Polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), heavy metals, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are increasingly released as waste, endangering the environment. In countries like Ghana, where regulations are weakly enforced, industrial waste is released uncontrollably, posing threats to public health, environmental integrity, and food systems. This study systematically evaluated existing literature on PBDEs, heavy metals, PAHs, and organic contaminant exposure in Ghana and proposes a roadmap for achieving food safety and protecting the environment and human health. The research identified high mobility of specific heavy metals and risks associated with PBDEs and PAHs in sediments, dumpsites, and various food items. Unregulated dumping of electronic waste with PBDEs raised environmental concerns. An integrated approach is needed to address the multifaceted impact of organic pollutants on public health and ecosystems. Urgent implementation of effective environmental management strategies and regulatory measures is crucial. The study proposed short- to mid-term priorities emphasising the need to foster collaboration and implementing global measures. The mid- to long-term strategy includes a national information surveillance system, local monitoring capacity development, and integrating land contamination controls with food safety legislation. These measures would mitigate risks, ensure sustainable practices, and improve overall food safety management in Ghana, serving as a model for regions facing similar challenges with diverse pollutants. © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2024.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: O.E.

An increasing number of studies have suggested that the occurrence of chronic noncommunicable diseases is affected by both environmental exposures and genetic factors. Research has also shown that environmental pollution may increase the risk of MAFLD and promote its occurrence and development. However, the relationship between these concepts, as well as the underlying exposure effects and mechanism, remains incompletely understood. Lipidomics, a branch of metabolomics that studies lipid disorders, can help researchers investigate abnormal lipid metabolites in various disease states. Lipidome-exposome wide association studies are a promising paradigm for investigating the health effects of cumulative environmental exposures on biological responses, and could provide new ideas for determining the associations between metabolic and lipid changes and disease risk caused by chemical-pollutant exposure. Hence, in this study, targeted exposomics and nontargeted lipidomics studies based on ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) were used to characterize exogenous chemical pollutants and endogenous lipid metabolites in the sera of patients with MAFLD and healthy subjects. The results demonstrated that fipronil sulfone, malathion dicarboxylic acid, and monocyclohexyl phthalate may be positively associated with the disease risk of patients diagnosed as simple fatty liver disease (hereafter referred to as MAFLD(0)). Moreover, fipronil sulfone, acesulfame potassium, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA), 4-hydroxybenzophenone, and 3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzoic acid (DBPOB) may be positively associated with the disease risk of patients diagnosed as fatty liver complicated by single or multiple metabolic disorders. Association analysis was carried out to explore the lipid metabolites induced by chemical residues. Triglyceride (TG) and diglyceride (DG) were significantly increased in MAFLD and MAFLD(0). The numbers of carbons of significantly changed DGs and TGs were mainly in the ranges of 32-40 and 35-60, respectively, and both were mainly characterized by changes in polyunsaturated lipids. Most of the lipid-effect markers were positively correlated with chemical residues and associated with increased disease risk.

Concerted efforts have been made by relevant organizations utilizing legislative laws to ban their production and get rid of them completely for the sake of public health. However, they have remained refractive in different compartments of the environment. Their bioavailability is majorly a function of different anthropogenic activities. Landfilling and incineration are among the earliest classical means of environmental remediation of waste; however, they are not sustainable due to the seepage of contaminants in landfills, the release of toxic gases into the atmosphere and energy requirements during incineration. Other advanced waste destruction technologies have been explored for the degradation of these recalcitrant pollutants; although, some are efficient, but are limited by high amounts of energy consumption, the use of organic solvents and hazardous chemicals, high capital and operational cost, and lack of public trust. Thus, this study has systematically reviewed different contaminant degradation technologies, their efficiency, and feasibility.

Pesticide applicators in the U.S. encounter a statement on pesticide labels, which coarsely indicate which products dissipate over the course of an evening. There is reason to suspect that these statements may not align with residual toxicity data, given previous findings. Without a complete database of residual toxicity estimates; however, it is not possible to determine whether the residual toxicity components of statements on pesticide labels similarly diverge from published studies. We compiled 50 studies on residual toxicity trials with formulated pesticides and calculated the residual time to 25% mortality (RT25) of each assay for three different bee species (Apis mellifera, Nomia melanderi, and Megachile rotundata). Our findings were compared to a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published database of RT25 values. Of the RT25 values that we could compare, we found that over 90% of the values support a similar conclusion to the EPA. Next, we compared our values and the EPA’s values to the statements on 155 EPA registered pesticide product labels. Of these labels, a little less than a third presented their residual toxicity in a manner inconsistent with their calculated RT25 and current EPA labeling guidelines. Moreover, over a third of labels contained an active ingredient which was neither listed under the EPA’s RT25 database nor had a published study to estimate this value. We provide the first evidence that many pesticide labels may convey residual toxicity information to applicators that is not correct and could lead to bees being exposed to toxic residues on plants.

Recent evidence has emphasized the critical role of microRNA (miRNA)-mRNA networks in various chronic wounds, including DFU. In this study, we aimed to clarify the miRNA-mRNA axes associated with the occurrence of DFU. Methods: Expression profiles of miRNAs and mRNAs were extracted from the Gene Expression Omnibus. Differentially expressed genes and differentially expressed miRNAs were identified, and miRNA-mRNA regulatory axes were constructed through integrated bioinformatics analyses. We validated the miRNA-mRNA axes using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) and dual-luciferase reporter assays. We conducted an immune infiltration analysis and confirmed the bioinformatics results using immunofluorescence staining. Single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) was used to analyze the metabolic mechanisms. Results: miR-182-5p-CHL1/MITF and miR-338-3p-NOVA1 interactions were identified using in silico analysis. The qPCR results showed apparent dysregulation of these miRNA-mRNA axes in DFU. The dual-luciferase reporter assay confirmed that miR-182-5p targeted CHL1 and MITF, and miR-338-3p targeted NOVA1. We conducted an immune infiltration analysis and observed that key genes correlated with decreased infiltration of M1 macrophages and resting mast cells in DFU. Immunofluorescence staining verified the co-localization of CHL1 and tryptase, while MITF and CD68 showed weak positive correlations. Metabolic pathways related to these three genes were identified using ssGSEA. Conclusions: In summary, the miR-182-5p-CHL1/MITF and miR-338-3p-NOVA1 pathway interactions and decreased infiltration of M1 macrophages and resting mast cells may provide novel clues to the pathogenesis of DFU.

One of the significant ways for MPs to enter the aquatic environment is through the effluent discharge of wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs). In this study, first, the concentration and characteristics of MPs in secondary wastewater effluent, and the influential variables related to the coagulation process, for MPs removal were identified using systematic reviews of previous studies. Then, the most proper MPs characterization and coagulation variables were chosen by experts’ opinions using a fuzzy Delphi method. Therefore, the experiment tested in conditions close to the full-scale wastewater treatments. Finally, in the laboratory removal of MPs by coagulation of polyamide (PA), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene (PE), < 125 and 300–600 μm in size, was tested by a jar test applying Al2(SO4)3 in doses of 5 to 100 mg/L plus 15 mg/L polyacrylamide as a coagulant aid. Using R and Excel software, the results were analyzed statistically. It was concluded that the maximum and minimum removal efficiency was 74.7 and 1.39% for small PA and large PE, respectively. Smaller MPs were found to have higher removal efficiency. The MPs type PA achieved greater removal efficiency than PS, while PE had the least removal efficiency. © 2023, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: R.N.

The acute response involves changes in blood and tissue biomarkers and in cardiac in vivo imaging acquired with ultrasound, magnetic resonance and positron emission tomography. Longitudinal follow up using in vivo imaging, histochemistry, protein and proteomics analyses evidences a continued metabolic reprogramming of the heart towards metabolic malfunction, eventually leading to irreversible damage in cardiac function and structure.

Methods The literatures about the application of ERAS in pediatric congenital choledochal cyst were searched in Chinese and English databases including Wanfang Medical Network, CNKI, PubMed, Web of Science and EBSCO. Only Chinese and English literatures were searched from January 1, 2000 to August 31, 2021. English and Chinese keywords included enhanced recovery after surgery, fast track surgery, ERAS, FTS, choledochal cysts, choledochocyst, bile duct cyst, biliary dilatation and surgery. Two researchers were selected to complete data entry, including case load, perioperative interventional measures, initial postoperative exhaust and defecation time, postoperative length of stay and complications. Meta-analysis was performed with Stata 13.0 software. And 12 test was utilized for examining the heterogeneity between the eligible studies. And fixed/random-effect model was employed according to the test results. Publication bias was assessed by Begg's test. Sensitivity analysis was performed for initial postoperative defecation time and postoperative hospitalization stay. Results Seven articles with a total of 478 cases were retrieved. As compared with conventional group, ERAS group had significantly shorter initial postoperative defecation (SMD: 1. 19, 95 % CI:0. 86-1. 52, P< 0.001) and postoperative length of hospitalization stay (SMD: 1. 97, 95%CI: 1. 55-2. 38, P<0.001). ERAS group had a lower incidence of postoperative incision infection (OR: 0. 32, 95%CI:0. 10-0. 98, P<0.05), postoperative anastomotic leakage (OR: 0. 16, 95% CI: 0.03-0. 91, P<0.05) and postoperative respiratory tract infection (OR: O. 19, 95%CJ:0.06-0. 60, P<0.05). Conclusions For children with choledochal cyst, application of ERAS concept in perioperative period is both safe and feasible.

The review was completed in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and included a review of almost 1000 peer-reviewed publications. In total, 26 articles were found to report half-lives in humans, with the majority of data coming from studies performed in North America on individuals suspected to have been exposed to PCBs. Terminology for reporting PCB half-lives was inconsistent, so we have attempted to consolidate this and recommend using either “apparent half-life” or “intrinsic half-life” in future studies. Within the literature, values for reported half-lives varied considerably for different PCBs. Less chlorinated PCBs generally have shorter half-lives than more chlorinated PCBs. It was interesting to note the large variability of half-lives reported for the same PCB. For example, the reported half-life for PCB 180 varied by nearly 3 orders of magnitude (0.34 years–300 years). Our review identified that the half-lives estimated were largely dependent on the studied cohort. We discuss the importance of PCB body burden, degree of chlorination and PCB structure, gender, age, breastfeeding, BMI, and smoking status on half-life estimations. We also identified significantly shorter half-lives for some PCBs in occupationally exposed individuals compared to results reported from the general population. PCB half-lives are not the same for every PCB or every individual. Therefore, careful consideration is needed when these values are used in human exposure studies. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: C.D.

Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) are major groups of chemical stressors. For example, dioxin-like polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are closely associated with the incidence of inflammatory diseases. The pathology of environmental chemical-mediated inflammatory diseases is complex and may involve disturbances in multiple organs, including the gut, liver, brain, vascular tissues, and immune systems. Recent studies suggested that diet-derived nutrients (e.g., phytochemicals, vitamins, unsaturated fatty acids, dietary fibers) could modulate environmental insults and affect disease development, progression, and outcome. In this article, mechanisms of environmental pollutant-induced inflammation and cardiometabolic diseases are reviewed, focusing on multi-organ interplays and highlighting recent advances in nutritional strategies to improve the outcome of cardiometabolic diseases associated with environmental exposures. In addition, advanced system biology approaches are discussed, which present unique opportunities to unveil the complex interactions among multiple organs and to fuel the development of precision intervention strategies in exposed individuals. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: P.

More than 29% of the vegetable samples (1577) were contaminated with pesticide residue; among the contaminated samples (458), most cases (73%) exceeded the maximum residue limits (MRLs). The pesticide-contaminated vegetables were cucumber (51%), tomato (41%), cauliflower (31%), miscellaneous vegetables (36%), eggplant (29%), beans (23%), cabbage (18%), and gourds (16%). Among the pesticide-contaminated samples, vegetables with above MRL were gourds (100%), beans (92), tomato (78%), eggplant (73%), miscellaneous vegetables (69%), cucumber (62%), cabbage (50%), cauliflower (50%) (p < 0.05). It was also observed that a single vegetable was often contaminated with multiple pesticides, and farmers did not follow a proper withdrawal period while using pesticides. Hazard quotation (HQ>1) was observed in adolescents and adults in tomato, eggplant, beans, cauliflower, cabbage, cucumber, lady's finger, lettuce, and coriander. There was no health risk observed (HQ<1) in gourds, potato, carrot, onion, red chilli, red amaranth, spinach, and okra. The highest acute and chronic HQ (aHQ, cHQ) was observed for cypermethrin (bean) in adolescents (aHQ=255, cHQ= 510) and adults (aHQ=131, cHQ=263). It was also observed that these pesticides harmed air, soil, water, and non-target organisms. Nevertheless, the review will help the government develop policies that reduce pesticide use and raise people's awareness of its harmful effects. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: P.

In this exploratory study, we examined associations between agricultural use of 22 individual active ingredients and 13 chemical groups and HL incidence. Methods: We used data from three agricultural cohorts participating in the AGRICOH consortium: the French Agriculture and Cancer Cohort (2005–2009), Cancer in the Norwegian Agricultural Population (1993–2011), and the US Agricultural Health Study (1993–2011). Lifetime pesticide use was estimated from crop-exposure matrices or self-report. Cohort-specific covariate-adjusted overall and age-specific (< 40 or ≥ 40 years) hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox regression and combined using random effects meta-analysis. Results: Among 316 270 farmers (75% male) accumulating 3 574 815 person-years at risk, 91 incident cases of HL occurred. We did not observe statistically significant associations for any of the active ingredients or chemical groups studied. The highest risks of HL overall were observed for the pyrethroids deltamethrin (meta-HR = 1.86, 95% CI 0.76–4.52) and esfenvalerate (1.86, 0.78–4.43), and inverse associations of similar magnitude were observed for parathion and glyphosate. Risk of HL at ≥ 40 years of age was highest for ever-use of dicamba (2.04, 0.93–4.50) and lowest for glyphosate (0.46, 0.20–1.07). Conclusion: We report the largest prospective investigation of these associations. Nonetheless, low statistical power, a mixture of histological subtypes and a lack of information on tumour EBV status complicate the interpretability of the results. Most HL cases occurred at older ages, thus we could not explore associations with adolescent or young adult HL. Furthermore, estimates may be attenuated due to non-differential exposure misclassification. Future work should aim to extend follow-up and refine both exposure and outcome classification. © 2023, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

However, its toxic effects on vegetable growth during agricultural production have not been reported. In this study, we investigated the response mechanisms of hydroponic lettuce to DBDPE accumulation, antioxidant stress, cell structure damage, and metabolic pathways after exposure to DBDPE. The concentration of DBDPE in the root of lettuce was significantly higher than that in the aboveground part. DBDPE induced oxidative stress on lettuce, which stimulated the defense of the antioxidative system of lettuce cells, and the cell structure produced slight plasma-wall separation. In terms of metabolism, metabolic pathway disorders were caused, which are mainly manifested as inhibiting amino acid biosynthesis and metabolism-related pathways, interfering with the biosyntheses of amino acids, organic acids, fatty acids, carbohydrates, and other substances, and ultimately manifested as decreased total chlorophyll content and root activity. In turn, metabolic regulation alleviated antioxidant stress. The mechanisms of the antioxidative reaction of lettuce to DBDPE were elucidated by IBR, PLS-PM analysis, and molecular docking.

Our experimental outcomes were compared to previous studies using meta-analysis. Coincident with the introduction of salmon, the PCB and DDE burden of resident trout significantly increased. However, we did not observe changes in total mercury (Hg). Two years after the salmon addition experiment concluded, resident trout POP concentrations had returned to pre-addition levels, with no difference between the treatment and control reaches. Analysis of effect sizes suggested that the contaminant response observed in our experiment is consistent with field survey observations. Our study suggested that the consumption of salmon eggs drove the increase in POP burden of resident trout while Hg bioaccumulation was influenced by watershed sources.

Many of the persistent pollutants found in industrial effluents cannot be effectively removed by conventional treatment procedures. Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) have emerged as a promising solution, offering versatile and effective means of pollutant removal and mineralization. This comprehensive review explores the application of various AOP strategies in industrial wastewater treatment, focusing on their mechanisms and effectiveness. Ozonation (O3): Ozonation, leveraging ozone (O3), represents a well-established AOP for industrial waste water treatment. Ozone's formidable oxidative potential enables the breakdown of a broad spectrum of organic and inorganic contaminants. This paper provides an in-depth examination of ozone reactions, practical applications, and considerations involved in implementing ozonation. UV/Hydrogen Peroxide (UV/H2O2): The combination of ultraviolet (UV) light and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) has gained prominence as an AOP due to its ability to generate hydroxyl radicals (ȮH), highly efficient in pollutant degradation. The review explores factors influencing the efficiency of UV/H2O2 processes, including H2O2 dosage and UV radiation intensity. Fenton and Photo-Fenton Processes: Fenton's reagent and Photo-Fenton processes employ iron ions and hydrogen peroxide to generate hydroxyl radicals for pollutant oxidation. The paper delves into the mechanisms, catalyst selection, and the role of photoactivation in enhancing degradation rates within the context of industrial wastewater treatment. Electrochemical Advanced Oxidation Processes (EAOPs): EAOPs encompass a range of techniques, such as electro-Fenton and anodic oxidation, which employ electrode reactions to produce ȮH radicals. This review explores the electrochemical principles, electrode materials, and operational parameters critical for optimizing EAOPs in industrial wastewater treatment. TiO2 Photocatalysis (UV/TiO2): Titanium dioxide (TiO2) photocatalysis, driven by UV light, is examined for its potential in industrial wastewater treatment. The review investigates TiO2 catalyst properties, reaction mechanisms, and the influence of parameters like catalyst loading and UV intensity on pollutant removal. Sonolysis (Ultrasonic Irradiation): High-frequency ultrasound-induced sonolysis represents a unique AOP, generating ȮH radicals during the formation and collapse of cavitation bubbles. This paper delves into the physics of cavitation, sonolytic reactions, and optimization strategies for industrial wastewater treatment. This review offers a critical assessment of the applicability, advantages, and limitations of these AOP strategies in addressing the diverse challenges posed by industrial wastewater. It emphasizes the importance of selecting AOPs tailored to the specific characteristics of industrial effluents and outlines potential directions for future research and practical implementation. The integrated use of these AOPs, when appropriately adapted, holds the potential to achieve sustainable and efficient treatment of industrial wastewater, contributing significantly to environmental preservation and regulatory compliance. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: B.

Currently, rodent-based risk assessment studies cannot adequately capture neurodegenerative effects of pesticides due to a lack of human-relevant endpoints targeted at neurodegeneration. Thus, there is a need for improvement of the risk assessment guidelines. Specifically, a mechanistic assessment strategy, based on human physiology and (patho)biology is needed, which can be applied in next generation risk assessment. The Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework is particularly well-suited to provide the mechanistic basis for such a strategy. Here, we conducted a semi-systematic review in Embase and MEDLINE, focused on neurodegeneration and pesticides, to develop an AOP network for parkinsonian motor symptoms. Articles were labelled and included/excluded using the online platform Sysrev. Only primary articles, written in English, focused on effects of pesticides or PD model compounds in models for the brain were included. A total of 66 articles, out of the 1700 screened, was included. PD symptoms are caused by loss of function and ultimately death of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Our literature review highlights that a unique feature of these cells that increases their vulnerability is their reliance on continuous low-level influx of calcium. As such, excess intracellular calcium was identified as a central early Key Event (KE). This KE can lead to death of dopaminergic neurons of the SN, and eventually parkinsonian motor symptoms, via four distinct pathways: 1) activation of calpains, 2) endoplasmic reticulum stress, 3) impairment of protein degradation, and 4) oxidative damage. Several receptors have been identified that may serve as molecular initiating events (MIEs) to trigger one or more of these pathways. The proposed AOP network provides the biological basis that can be used to develop a mechanistic testing strategy that captures neurodegenerative effects of pesticides. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: H.J.

Unraveling the phytotoxic mechanisms of POPs in crops is critical for evaluating their environmental risks. Herein, the molecular mechanism of POP-induced phytotoxicity in rice (Oryza sativa L.) was analyzed using metabolic profile, enzyme activity, and gene expression as linkages, including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, polychlorinated biphenyls, and phthalate esters. Despite no observable changes in phenotypic traits (e.g., biomass and length of aboveground), the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were promoted under stresses of the tested POPs, particularly 2,2′,4,4′-tetrabromodiphenyl ether (BDE-47), dibutyl phthalate (DBP), and di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP). Metabolomics analysis revealed that ROS contents positively correlated with metabolic perturbation levels (r = 0.83), among which the galactose metabolism was significantly inhibited when exposed to DBP, DEHP, or BDE-47. The α-Galactosidase (α-Gal) involved in galactose metabolism was targeted as the key enzyme for the phytotoxicity of DBP, DEHP, and BDE-47, which was revealed by the inhibition of saccharide levels (45.5−82.1%), the catalytic activity of α-Gal (18.5−24.3%), and the gene expression (28.5−34.5%). Molecular docking simulation suggested that the three POPs occupied the active sites of α-Gal and formed a stable protein-ligand complex, thus inhibiting the catalytic activity of α-Gal. Partial least-squares regression analysis indicated that α-Gal activity was negatively associated with hydrogen bond acceptor, rotatable bond, and topological polar surface area of POPs. The results offered novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of phytotoxicity of POPs and provided important information for evaluating the environmental risk of POPs. © 2023","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: L.

However, the functional components of these two species responsible for the treatment efficacy are yet not clear. In order to explore the therapeutic material basis of Lilii Bulbus, we selected L. davidii var. willmottiae (LD) only used for food as the control group to analyze the differences between LD and the other two (LB and LL). Methods: Metabolome and transcriptome were carried out to investigate the differences of active components in LD vs LB and LD vs LL. Data of metabolome and transcriptome was analysed using various analysis methods, such as principal component analysis (PCA), hierarchical cluster analysis (HCH) analysis, and so on. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched through KEGG and GO enrichment analysis. Results: The PCA and HCH analysis of the metabolome indicated the metabolites were clearly separated and varied greatly in LL and LB contrasted with LD. There were 318 significantly differential metabolites (SDMs) in LD vs LB group and 298 SDMs in LD vs LL group. Compared with LD group, the significant up-regulation of steroidal saponins and steroidal alkaloids were detected both in LB and LL groups, especially in LB group. The HCH analysis of transcriptome indicated that there was significant difference in LB vs LD group, while the difference between LL and LD varied slightly. Additionally, 47 540 DEGs in LD vs LB group and 18 958 DEGs in LD vs LL group were identified. Notably, CYP450s involving in the biosynthesis of steroidal saponins and steroidal alkaloids were detected, and comparing with LD, CYP724, CYP710A, and CYP734A1 in LB and CYP90B in LL were all up-regulated.

Because of their environmental persistence, long-range transport potential, bioaccumulation potential, and biotoxicity, SCCPs pose a significant threat to human health. In this study, metabolomics technology was applied to reveal the metabolomic interference in human normal hepatic (L02) cells after exposure to low (1µg/L), moderate (10µg/L), and high (100100µg) doses of SCCPs. Principal component analysis (PCA) and metabolic effect level index(MELI) values showed that all three SCCP doses caused notable metabolic perturbations in L02 cells. A total of 72 metabolites that were annotated by MS/MS and matched with the experimental spectra in the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) or validated by commercially available standards were selected as differential metabolites (DMs) across all groups. The low-dose exposure group shared 33 and 36 DMs with the moderate- and high-dose exposure groups, respectively. The moderate-dose exposure group shared 46 DMs with the high-dose exposure group. In addition, 33 DMs were shared among the three exposure groups. Among the 72 DMs, 9, 9, and 45 metabolites participated in the amino acid, nucleotide, and lipid metabolism pathways, respectively. The results of pathway enrichment analysis showed that the most relevant metabolic pathways affected by SCCPs were the lipid metabolism, fatty acid $\beta$-oxidation, and nucleotide metabolism pathways, and that compared with low-dose exposure, moderate- and high-dose SCCP exposures caused more notable perturbations of these metabolic pathways in L02 cells. Exposure to SCCPs perturbed glycerophospholipid and sphingolipid metabolism. Significant alterations in the levels of phosphatidylcholines, phosphatidylethanolamines, and sphingomyelins indicated SCCP-induced biomembrane damage. SCCPs inhibited fatty acid ß-oxidation by decreasing the levels of short- and medium-chain acylcarnitines in L02 cells, indicating that the energy supplied by fatty acid oxidation was reduced in these cells. Furthermore, compared with low- and moderate-dose SCCPs, high-dose SCCPs produced a significantly stronger inhibition of fatty acid $\beta$-oxidation. In addition, SCCPs perturbed nucleotide metabolism. The higher hypoxanthine levels observed in L02 cells after SCCP exposures indicate that SCCPs may induce several adverse effects, including hypoxia, reactive oxygen species production, and mutagenesis in L02 cells. © (2024), (Zhongguo Kexueyuan - Chinese Academy of Sciences).

However, the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Our study aimed to investigate PFBS exposure effects during pregnancy and lactation on rat offspring lipid profiles and the possible underlying mechanisms. Although the biochemical index difference including total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), alanine amino transaminase (ALT), aspartate amino transferase (AST), and fasting blood glucose between exposed groups and the control group was not significant, transcriptome analyses showed that the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the 50 mg/kg/day PFBS exposure group were significantly related to protein digestion and absorption, peroxisome proliferator activated-receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway, xenobiotic metabolism by cytochrome P450, glycine, serine and threonine metabolism, β-alanine metabolism, bile secretion, unsaturated fatty acid (FA) biosynthesis, and alanine, aspartate and glutamate metabolism. Untargeted metabolomics analyses identified 17 differential metabolites in the 50 mg/kg/day PFBS exposure group. Among these, phosphatidylserine [PS (18:0/22:6(4Z,7Z,10Z,13Z,16Z,19Z))], lysoPE (18:1(11Z)/0:0), and PS (14:0/20:4(5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z)) were significantly correlated with phospholipid metabolism disorders. Correlation analysis indicated the DEGs, including FA binding protein (Fabp4), spermine oxidase (Smox), Fabp2, acyl-CoA thioesterase 5 (Acot5), sarcosine dehydrogenase (Sardh), and amine oxidase, copper-containing 3 (Aoc3) that significantly enriched in xenobiotic metabolism by cytochrome P450 and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism signaling pathways were highly related to the differential metabolite pantetheine 4’−phosphate. Pantetheine 4′-phosphate was significantly negatively associated with non-high-density lipoprotein (non-HDL) and TC levels.

In 2016, the first international consortium paper on cigarette smoking during pregnancy and offspring DNA methylation identified extensive, reproducible exposure signals. This finding raised expectations for epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of other exposures. OBJECTIVE: We review the current state-of-the-science for DNA methylation associations across prenatal exposures in humans and provide future recommendations. METHODS: We reviewed 134 prenatal environmental EWAS of DNA methylation in newborns, focusing on 51 epidemiological studies with meta-analysis or replication testing. Exposures spanned cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, air pollution, dietary factors, psychosocial stress, metals, other chemicals, and other exogenous factors. Of the reproducible DNA methylation signatures, we examined implementation as exposure biomarkers. RESULTS: Only 19 (14%) of these prenatal EWAS were conducted in cohorts of 1,000 or more individuals, reflecting the still early stage of the field. To date, the largest perinatal EWAS sample size was 6,685 participants. For comparison, the most recent genome-wide association study for birth weight included more than 300,000 individuals. Replication, at some level, was successful with exposures to cigarette smoking, folate, dietary glycemic index, particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter <10 lm and <2:5 lm, nitrogen dioxide, mercury, cadmium, arsenic, electronic waste, PFAS, and DDT. Reproducible effects of a more limited set of prenatal exposures (smoking, folate) enabled robust methylation biomarker creation. DISCUSSION: Current evidence demonstrates the scientific premise for reproducible DNA methylation exposure signatures. Better powered EWAS could identify signatures across many exposures and enable comprehensive biomarker development. Whether methylation biomarkers of exposures themselves cause health effects remains unclear. We expect that larger EWAS with enhanced coverage of epigenome and exposome, along with improved single-cell technologies and evolving methods for integrative multi-omics analyses and causal inference, will expand mechanistic under-standing of causal links between environmental exposures, the epigenome, and health outcomes throughout the life course. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP12956. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Metabolomics is a rapidly developing discipline that deals with the metabolites as the final products of all genetically controlled biochemical pathways, highly influenced by external and internal changes. The aim of this paper was to review the published studies whose results suggest or deny a possible association between the fine regulation of the metabolome and PPD, enabling conclusions about whether metabolomics could be a useful tool in defining the biochemical pathways directly involved in the etiology, diagnosis and course of PPD. Beside numerous hormonal changes, a lot of different metabolic pathways have been discovered to be affected in women with PPD or associated with its development, including alterations in the energy metabolism, tryptophan and amino acid metabolism, steroid metabolism, purine cycle, as well as neurotransmitter metabolism. Additionally, metabolomics helped in defining the association between PPD and the exposure to various endocrine disrupting metabolites during pregnancy. Finally, metabolome reflects different PPD therapies and exposure of fetus or breastfed infants to pharmacotherapy prescribed to a mother suffering from PPD.

Currently, no systematic monitoring of PFAS levels in the general Danish population has been conducted. Objective: To study temporal trends of PFAS concentrations in the Danish population. Materials and methods: In August 2023, we performed a search for original peer-reviewed reports in PubMed using combinations of search terms for PFAS and Denmark. Reports were included if they comprised a Danish study population and direct measurements of PFAS in serum or plasma samples. Scatter plots of medians presented in the reports were used to visualize time-trends of PFAS concentrations among Danish individuals. Results: We included 29 reports based on a total of 18,231 individuals from 19 Danish study populations. A total of 24 PFAS measured in serum or plasma were presented in the reports, the most frequent being PFOS, PFOA, PFDA, PFNA, PFHpA, PFHpS, and PFHxS. Median concentrations of PFOS ranged from 4.0 ng/mL to 44.5 ng/mL, PFOA ranged from 0.8 ng/mL to 9.7 ng/mL, while lower concentrations were presented for the other PFAS. Median concentrations of PFOS and PFOA increased from 1988 until the late 1990s followed by a decrease until 2021. A less clear time-trend were observed for the other PFAS. Conclusion: Blood concentrations of PFOS and PFOA in the Danish population have declined substantially from the late 1990s until 2021 reflecting a phase-out of the production and regulation of the use of these PFAS. Time-trends for PFDA, PFNA, PFHpA, PFHpS, and PFHxS were less evident, yet a tendency toward a decline was observed. As only some of the compounds are measured, it is not possible to determine if the decrease in some PFAS is outweighed by an increase in others. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: S.D.

Legacy, such as organochlorine pesticides, and emerging contaminants, like microplastics and pharmaceuticals, may have effects on marine mammals' health at individual and population levels. Therefore, the evaluation of the risks associated with pollutants in this group is of great importance. The aim of this review is to provide information on the occurrence of legacy and emerging contaminants in marine mammals that inhabit Argentine waters. Also, to identify knowledge gaps and suggest best practices for future research. Reports of legacy contaminants referring to organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls were found in five species of cetaceans and two of pinnipeds. With respect to emerging pollutants, the presence of plastics was only evaluated in three species. Reported data was from at least a decade ago. Therefore, it is necessary to update existing information and conduct continuous monitoring to assess temporary trends in pollutants. All the studies were carried out in the province of Buenos Aires and Northern Patagonia indicating a knowledge gap in the southern zone of the Argentine Sea. In addition, pollutants of global environmental concern that have not been studied in Argentina are discussed. Future studies should fill these gaps and a greater effort to understand the relationships between pollutants and their effects on marine mammals is suggested. This issue will make it possible to determine thresholds for all the substances and species evaluated in order to carry out more detailed risk assessments and make decisions for the conservation of marine mammals in Argentine waters. © 2023 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.B.

In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we examined the association between PFAS exposure, particularly Perfluorooctanoic Acid (PFOA), and Perfluorooctane Sulfonic Acid (PFOS), and risk of kidney, liver, and testicular cancer. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed to identify cohort and case-control studies reported after the Monograph of the International Agency for Research on Cancer and the Toxicological Profile of the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry. We assessed the quality of the studies by using a modified version of the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS). Forest relative risk (RR) plots were constructed for liver, kidney, and testicular cancer. We conducted stratified analyses by geographic region, study design, quality score, outcome, years of publication, exposure source, and PFAS type. A random-effects model was used to address heterogeneity between studies. Results: Fifteen studies, including ten cohort studies, three case-control studies nested in a cohort, and two case-control studies were included after removing duplicate and irrelevant reports. We found an association between overall PFAS exposure and the risk of kidney cancers (RR=1.18, 95% CI =1.05-1.32; I =52.8%, 11 studies). Also, we showed an association between high-level exposure to PFAS and kidney cancer (RR=1.74, 95% CI =1.23-2.47; p=0.005) and testicular cancer (RR=2.22, 95% CI =1.12-4.39; p=0.057). There was no association with liver cancer. We found no heterogeneity by geographical region, PFAS type, study design, outcome, quality score, year of publication, or exposure source. Only two studies reported results among women. Conclusions: We detected an association between overall PFAS exposure and kidney cancer and high doses of PFAS with testicular cancer. However, bias and confounding cannot be excluded, precluding a conclusion in terms of causality. © 2023, Mattioli 1885.

Materials and methods: Observational studies or clinical trials were included if measured 25(OH)D serum levels in pregnant women and/or in their children (up to 3 years old) and evaluated the occurrence of DDD in the primary dentition of offspring associated with the low 25(OH)D levels. Literature reviews, case reports, laboratory and/or animals’ studies, conference abstracts, letters to the editor, book chapters and clinical protocols were excluded. Searches were carried out in 6 electronic databases and in the gray literature until March 2023, without restrictions. The study quality was assessed by the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale and the certainty of the evidence by GRADE. Data were descriptively synthesized considering the association between DDD and 25(OH)D levels. Results: Seven studies were included. Only developmental enamel defects (DED) were observed after examination of 6651 children. The incidence of DED ranged from 8.9% to 66%. Six studies found no association between low levels of 25(OH)D and DED. However, one reported correlation between hypomineralization of the primary second molar (HSMD) and low levels of 25(OH)D at birth. Methodological flaws were observed in all studies and the certainty of the evidence was very low. Conclusion: Although HSMD was the only DDD associated with low levels of 25(OH)D in children, the available evidence is still not conclusive. More robust studies are needed to endorse the biological plausibility of DDD in primary teeth due to low serum levels of 25(OH)D in pregnant women or in their children.

Methods: A thorough search was performed in PubMed and Web of Science databases up to February 2023 to identify biomonitoring studies on human exposure and levels in the GCC region. Two independent reviewers assessed study eligibility, conducted data extraction and risk of bias assessment. The NIH Quality Assessment Tools and PRISMA guidelines were utilized for quality evaluation and reporting of results. Results: A total of 38 eligible articles were included in this systematic review out of 662 articles screened. The majority of the publications were from Saudi Arabia (n = 24) and Kuwait (n = 10), while limited representation was found from Qatar (n = 3) and the UAE (n = 1). No articles were identified from Oman and Bahrain. The studies focused on metals, organohalogen compounds, pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and phthalates. The findings revealed elevated levels of metals and established correlations between metal exposure and adverse health effects, including infant neurodevelopmental issues, vitamin D deficiency, and oxidative stress. The presence of organohalogen compounds and pesticides was prevalent in the GCC region, with significant associations between exposure to these compounds and negative health outcomes. Notably, high levels of perchlorate were observed in the Kuwaiti population, and a study from Saudi Arabia found an association between per- and polyfluorinated substances and increased odds of osteoporosis. Conclusions: This review emphasizes the need to address environmental health challenges in the GCC region through improved HBM research methods and strategies. Implementing biomonitoring programs, conducting cohort studies, investing in tools and expertise, promoting collaboration, and engaging the community are crucial for reliable HBM data in the GCC. © 2023 The Author(s)","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: K.

Direct chalcogenation of C-H bonds has evolved as a step- and atom-economical method for the synthesis of chalcogen-bearing compounds. Nevertheless, direct C-H chalcogenation severely lags behind C-C, C-N and C-O bond formations. Moreover, compared with the C-H monochalcogenation, reports of selective mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive dichalcogenation of C-H bonds are relatively scarce. The past decade has witnessed significant advancements in selective mono-/dichalcogenation and exclusive dichalcogenation of various C(sp2)-H and C(sp3)-H bonds via transition-metal-catalyzed/mediated, photocatalytic, electrochemical or metal-free approaches. In light of the significance of both mono- and dichalcogen-containing compounds in various fields of chemical science and the critical issue of chemoselectivity in organic synthesis, the present review systematically summarizes the advances in these research fields, with a special focus on elucidating scopes and mechanistic aspects. Moreover, the synthetic limitations, applications of some of these processes, the current challenges and our own perspectives on these highly active research fields are also discussed. Based on the substrate types and C-H bonds being chalcogenated, the present review is organized into four sections: (1) transition-metal-catalyzed/mediated chelation-assisted selective C-H mono-/dichalcogenation or exclusive dichalcogenation of (hetero)arenes; (2) directing group-free selective C-H mono-/dichalcogenation or exclusive dichalcogenation of electron-rich (hetero)arenes; (3) C(sp3)-H dichalcogenation; (4) dichalcogenation of both C(sp2)-H and C(sp3)-H bonds.

In this context, activated carbon (AC) has emerged as a highly promising adsorbent, offering significant advantages over conventional forms. For instance, AC has demonstrated remarkable adsorption capabilities, as evidenced by the successful removal of atrazine and ibuprofen using KOH and KOH–CO2-activated char, achieving impressive adsorption rates of 90% and 95%, respectively, at an initial dosage of 10 mg L-1. Moreover, AC can effectively adsorb aromatic compounds through π-π stacking interactions. The aromatic rings in organic molecules can align and interact with the carbon atoms in AC's structure, leading to effective adsorption. In this review, by employing a systematic analysis of recent research findings (majorly from 2015 to 2023), an in-depth exploration of AC's evolution and its wide-ranging applications in adsorbing and remediating emerging pollutants, including dyes, organic contaminants, and hazardous gases and mitigating the adverse impacts of such emerging pollutants on ecosystems have been discussed.

However, their gastrointestinal biology (lack of stomach) has limited their acid-peptic digestion, acid lysis of plants and invertebrate tissues, and phosphorus uptake. This review presents data from 118 articles on the use of plant-based feed additives (PFAs) in Cyprinus carpio (common carp). Our review shows that most PFA research in carp is focused on improving feed and nutrient utilization efficiency along various levels (in vivo digestibility, metabolizability to in situ nutrient loading), while other half is focused on ensuring animal welfare standards (biomass, immunity, welfare). Several reviewed plant-based additives however tend to do both. The PFAs include essential oils (EOs), plant-part extracts (PPEs), medicinal plants (herbs) and spices. The effective inclusion rate of EOs is lower (0.5%–0.75%). Whereas PPEs, herbs and spices work at a generic inclusion rate of 2%–5% in carp feeds. Even at an optimum inclusion rate, there are factors controlling PFAs efficacy such as methods of preparation (reviewed). PFAs like lemon beebrush, geranium, dill, Rosemary pepper and common mallow with/without certain pre-conditions are better to avoid in cyprinid diets. Although certain PFAs may potentially alter organoleptic qualities of carp flesh or might assist in training carp immunity, information on these aspects is limited. The review also provides a quick guide to researchers and feed companies interested in exploring the potential of PFAs in C. carpio aquaculture. Potential PFAs that could be valuable for cyprinids, but not yet explored are also listed. © 2023 The Authors.

A total of 86 published papers were retrieved by this method and analyzed. Only nine studies of this total concerned PAH elasmobranch contamination, assessed in 10 shark species and one ray species, with only one study calculating human health risks.

Although the impact of biological contaminants on children's health is acknowledged, the long-term effects of these and emerging contaminants on young children may be underestimated. To map the existing evidence on health impacts of water contaminated with chemicals on young children (<5 years), we conducted a scoping review to select and organize relevant literature. Of the 98 studies in the review, 24 revealed that the hazard ratio of arsenic, nitrates, cadmium, and fluoride (all of which are on the World Health Organisation's list of 10 chemicals of public health concern) was higher in very young children than in older age groups. Anthropogenic activities (textile manufacturing, waste disposal, and intensified agriculture) are leading contributors to the release of chemicals to groundwater used for drinking. Three major pathways for chemical contamination exposure in young children were confirmed: maternal transmission during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and early school years. Children exhibited acute and chronic disruptions to their neurological, skeletal, reproductive, and endocrine systems, as well as cumulative carcinogenic risks, amongst other life-altering consequences. The lack of research on emerging contaminants' effects on young children in low-income countries is worrisome, as their increased use may compound the issues caused by the existing problem of “legacy chemicals.” Precautionary principle should regulate the operation of industries producing these chemicals in a robust manner. Evidence from major producers and exporters in high-income countries is sufficient to warrant action, even without waiting for direct harm to be observed in low-income countries. Literature recommends prioritising prevention of contamination over demand side treatment or finding alternative water sources, especially in water-scarce areas affected by climate change. Local and transnational efforts are required to enforce safer industry practices and prevent further water quality deterioration in low-income countries. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.C.

Allium cepa is a well-established plant model for toxicological studies. The aim of this scoping review was to investigate the recent application of the comet assay in Allium cepa root cells to assess the genotoxicity. To explore the literature a search was performed selecting articles published between January 2015 and February 2023 from Web of Science, PubMed, and Scopus databases using the combined search terms “Comet assay” and “Allium cepa”. All the original articles that applied the comet assay to Allium cepa root cells were included. Of the 334 records initially found, 79 articles were identified as meeting the inclusion criteria. Some studies reported results for two or more toxicants. In these cases, the data for each toxicant were treated separately. Thus, the number of analyzed toxicants (such as chemicals, new materials, and environmental matrices) was higher than the number of selected papers and reached 90. The current use of the Allium-comet assay seems to be directed towards two types of approach: the direct study of the genotoxicity of compounds, mainly biocides (20% of analyzed compounds) and nano- and microparticles (17%), and assessing a treatment's ability to reduce or eliminate genotoxicity of known genotoxicants (19%). Although the genotoxicity identified by the Allium-comet assay is only one piece of a larger puzzle, this method could be considered a useful tool for screening the genotoxic potential of compounds released into the environment. © 2023 The Authors.

Biodegradation represents a potentially crucial pathway to dissipate TC contamination. However, few efficient TC-degrading bacteria have been isolated and a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying TC degradation is still lacking. In this study, a novel TC-degrading bacterium, designated as Sphingobacterium sp. WM1, was successfully isolated from activated sludge. Strain WM1 exhibited a remarkable performance in degrading 50 mg/L TC within 1 day under co-metabolic conditions. Genomic analysis of the strain WM1 unveiled the presence of three functional tetX genes. Unraveling the complex molecular mechanisms, transcriptome analysis highlighted the role of upregulated transmembrane transport and accelerated electron transport in facilitating TC degradation. Proteomics confirmed the up-regulation of proteins involved in cellular biosynthesis/metabolism and ribosomal processes. Crucially, the tetX gene-encoding protein showed a significant upregulation, indicating its role in TC degradation. Heterologous expression of the tetX gene resulted in TC dissipation from an initial 51.9 mg/L to 4.2 mg/L within 24 h. The degradation pathway encompassed TC hydroxylation, transforming into TP461 and subsequent metabolites, which effectively depleted TC's inhibitory activity. Notably, the tetX genes in strain WM1 showed limited potential for horizontal gene transfer. Collectively, strain WM1′s potent TC degradation capacity signals a promise for enhancing TC clean-up strategies. © 2023 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: S.

MGD is characterized by a reduction in meibum secretion and/or a change in meibum composition that results in the disruption of the tear film lipid layer and an increase in the tear film evaporation rate. Excessive evaporation causes tear film instability, desiccation, tear hyperosmolarity, inflammation, and apoptosis of ocular surface cells, resulting in a continuous cycle of DED. The primary treatment goal for DED associated with MGD is to restore the tear film lipid layer and decrease evaporation, thereby reducing ocular signs and symptoms. The management of MGD includes home care options (eyelid hygiene, warming eye masks, ocular lubricants) and office-based treatments (manual expression, microblepharoexfoliation, thermal pulsation, intense pulsed light, intraductal probing). Topical ophthalmic prescription medications attempt to alter various factors that may contribute to DED (e.g., inflammation, bacterial growth, inadequate tear production). In this review, clinical evidence regarding available treatments and emerging therapies from randomized studies in patients with DED associated with MGD is summarized. Although some treatment modalities have been evaluated specifically for DED patients with MGD, large-scale randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm efficacy and safety in this patient population. Currently, there are no approved prescription pharmacologic treatments specifically indicated for DED associated with MGD, and those medications approved for the treatment of DED do not target the key driver of the disease (i.e., excessive evaporation).

It is traditionally used as an antipyretic, antirheumatic, antidiabetic and for the treatment of ulcers and parasite skin diseases. It also has a range of pharmacological effects, such as anti-inflammatory, anti-tumor, antioxidant, and antibacterial effects. However, there are no reports on the phytochemical profile and efficacy of its leaves extract to modulate dexamethasone induced pancreatic damage. Aim of the study: The present study was performed to annotate the phytoconstituents of Salix babylonica leaf extract and explore whether and how it could modulate dexamethasone-induced pancreatic damage and the role of oxidative stress and autophagy in mediating its protective effects. Materials and methods: Wistar rats were used for this study. Salix babylonica in two dose levels (100 and 200 mg/kg) or metformin (50 mg/kg) was given by oral gavage concurrently with dexamethasone which was injected SC in a dose of 10 mg/kg for 4 consecutive days. Results: LC-MS analysis furnished 84 secondary metabolites belonging to phenolic acids, salicinoids, proanthocyanidins, flavonoids, cyclohexanediol glycosides, and hydroxy fatty acids. S. babylonica at both dose levels and metformin decreased the elevated pancreatic beclin while elevated the decreased pancreatic P62/SQSTM1 content compared to dexamethasone. These effects were associated with improved histopathological changes, glycemic and lipid parameters indicating that there might be a connection between autophagy and dexamethasone-induced pancreatic damage. Given that the level of GSH was negatively correlated with the levels of beclin and positively correlated with P62/SQSTM1, while both MDA and NO levels were positively correlated with beclin and negatively correlated with P62/SQSTM1, it seems that dexamethasone induced autophagy may be attributed to dexamethasone induced pancreatic oxidative stress. Conclusion: Our results indicate that S. babylonica protects pancreatic tissues against dexamethasone-induced damage by decreasing oxidative stress and its associated autophagy. Our study reveals a new mechanism for dexamethasone effects on pancreas and shows the potential therapeutic role of S. babylonica in mitigating dexamethasone adverse effects on pancreas and establishes the groundwork for future clinical applications. © 2023","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: M.F.

Given that policy makers raise the high cost of remediation and of substituting PFAS with safer alternatives in consumer products as barriers to confronting adverse health outcomes associated with PFAS exposure, it is important to document the costs of inaction even in the presence of uncertainty. We therefore quantified disease burdens and related economic costs due to legacy PFAS exposures in the US in 2018. We leveraged systematic reviews and used meta-analytic inputs whenever possible, identified previously published exposure–response relationships, and calculated PFOA- and PFOS-attributable increases in 13 conditions. These increments were then applied to census data to determine total annual PFOA- and PFOS-attributable cases of disease, from which we calculated economic costs due to medical care and lost productivity using previously published cost-of-illness data. We identified PFAS-attributable disease costs in the US of $5.52 billion across five primary disease endpoints shown to be associated with PFAS exposure in meta-analyses. This estimate represented the lower bound, with sensitivity analyses revealing as much as $62.6 billion in overall costs. While further work is needed to assess probability of causation and establish with greater certainty effects of the broader category of PFAS, the results confirm further that public health and policy interventions are still necessary to reduce exposure to PFOA and PFOS and their endocrine-disrupting effects. This study demonstrates the large potential economic implications of regulatory inaction. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 20; Correspondence Address: L.

However, our understanding of the associations among rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microorganisms, and POPs degradation in different plant growth stages is limited. We combined stable-isotope probing (SIP), high-throughput sequencing, and metabolomics to analyze changes in rhizospheric soil metabolites, functional microbes, and BaP biodegradation in the early growth stages (tillering, jointing) and later stage (booting) of ryegrass. Microbial community structures differed significantly among growth stages. Metabolisms such as benzenoids and carboxylic acids tended to be enriched in the early growth stage, while lipids and organic heterocyclic compounds dominated in the later stage. From SIP, eight BaP-degrading microbes were identified, and most of which such as Ilumatobacter and Singulisphaera were first linked with BaP biodegradation. Notably, the relationship between the differential metabolites and BaP degradation efficiency further suggested that BaP-degrading microbes might metabolize BaP directly to produce benzenoid metabolites (3-hydroxybenzo[a]pyrene), or utilize benzenoids (phyllodulcin) to stimulate the co-metabolism of BaP in early growth stage; some lipids and organic acids, e.g. 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, might provide nutrients for the degraders to promote BaP metabolism in later stage. Accordingly, we determined that certain rhizospheric metabolites might regulate the rhizospheric microbial communities at different growth stages, and shift the composition and diversity of BaP-degrading bacteria, thereby enhancing in situ BaP degradation.

The initial stage of the surgeon’s and anaesthetist’s acquaintance with the patient is very important, as communication and rational presentation of information using illustrative and video material helps the patient understand the disease, consciously choose the proposed method of treatment, reduces anxiety, increases the role of the surgical team in treatment and satisfaction with its outcome, reduces the risk of dissatisfaction from false expectations (duration of the perioperative period, pain, changes in nutrition and mobility, sutures, etc.). The introduction of evidence-based medicine into the practice of operative gynaecology restructures classical approaches and principles of patient treatment, raises awareness of doctors and heads of surgical departments, and also contributes to the improvement of the outcome of operations. © Ján Užík, Olha Yeremenko, Natalia Sidelnyk, Tetyana Koriahinа, Mykola Mormul, 2023.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: S.

Objectives: The purpose of this review is to outline the role of sex hormones, particularly estrogen, in the pathogenesis of degenerative disc disease (DDD). Methods: A narrative review of studies discussing sex hormones and intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration was conducted through a search of bibliographic databases to identify various mechanisms involved in effectuating DDD. Results: Estrogen-deficient states negatively impact various aspects of IVD function. These internal hormone environments reflect routine changes that commonly arise with physiologic aging and can compromise IVD structural integrity through a host of processes. Additionally, allosteric molecules such as micro-RNAs (mi-RNAs) and G protein-coupled estrogen receptors (GPER) antagonists can bind to estrogen receptors and inhibit protective downstream effects with estrogen receptor signaling. Furthermore, cursory studies have observed chondrogenic effects with testosterone supplementation, although the specific mechanism remains unclear. Conclusions: Regulation of sex hormones, namely estrogen and testosterone, significantly impacts the structural integrity and function of IVDs. Uncovering underlying interactions driving these regulatory processes can facilitate development of novel, clinical therapies to treat DDD. © The Author(s) 2023.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: E.S.

The toxicity of florfenicol (FF) and polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) on rice seedlings was investigated. FF and PS-MPs caused colloidal agglomeration, which changed the environmental behavior of FF. FF inhibited rice growth and altered antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) activities, leading to membrane lipid peroxidation; impaired photosynthetic systems, decreased photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b, and carotene), chlorophyll precursors (Proto IX, Mg-Proto IX, and Pchlide), photosynthetic and respiratory rates. The key photosynthesis related genes (PsaA, PsaB, PsbA, PsbB, PsbC, and PsbD) were significantly down-regulated. The ultrastructure of mesophyll cells was destroyed with chloroplast swelling, membrane surface blurring, irregular thylakoid lamellar structure, and number of peroxisomes increased. PS-MPs mitigated FF toxicity, and the IBR index values showed that 10 mg∙L−1 PS-MPs were more effective. Metabolomic analysis revealed that the abundance of metabolites and metabolic pathways were altered by FF, was greater than the combined “MPs-FF” contamination.

Bacteria play vital role in the degradation and biotransformation of such persistent organic and harmful pollutants. In this experiment, Acinetobacter towneri NTA1-2A and Acinetobacter guillouiae TAT1-6A were used to degrade indole. Indole-degradated metabolites were analyzed by metabolomics analysis of fermentation broth of these strains using LC-MS/MS. The metabolomics analysis showed indole-5-carbonitrile 3-benzoyl (C16H10N2O), dimethyl sulfoxide (C2H6OS), deoxyguanosine (C10H13N5O4), Leu (C6H13NO2), and N-nitroso-pyrrolidine were indole-degradated metabolites formed by A. towneri NTA1-2A while neurine (C5H13NO) and norvaline (C5H11NO2) are common metabolites of both strains. The two strains' degradation metabolites differed from those reported in other studies, demonstrating the diversity of the distinct microbial strains approach to the metabolism of indolic compounds. Extracellular enzymes released to culture medium by these bacteria were also identified. In conclusion, the two bacterial strains have a potential of converting notorious indole compound to non-toxic intermediates mediated by enzymes. Hence, future study should focus on biochemical pathway and genetic basis for indole-degradated metabolites in the two strains. © 2023, Pleiades Publishing, Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: T.A.

Coroners have a duty to report cases where action should be taken to prevent future deaths, but dissemination of their findings remains poor. Objective: To identify preventable fall-related deaths, classify coroner concerns and explore organisational responses. Design: A retrospective systematic case series of coroners' Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports, from July 2013 (inception) to November 2022. Setting: England and Wales. Methods: Reproducible data collection methods were used to web-scrape and read PFD reports. Demographic information, coroner concerns and responses from organisations were extracted and descriptive statistics used to synthesise data. Results: Five hundred and twenty-seven PFDs (12.5% of PFDs) involved a fall that contributed to death. These deaths predominantly affected older people (median 82 years) in the community (72%), with subsequent death in hospital (70.8%). A high proportion of cases experienced fractures (51.6%), major bleeding (35.9%) or head injury (38.7%). Coroners frequently raised concerns regarding falls risks assessments (20.9%), failures in communication (20.3%) and documentation issues (17.5%). Only 56.7% of PFDs received a response from organisations to whom they were addressed. Organisations tended to produce new protocols (58.5%), improve training (44.6%) and commence audits (34.3%) in response to PFDs. Conclusions: One in eight preventable deaths in England and Wales involved a fall. Addressing concerns raised by coroners should improve falls prevention and care following falls especially for older adults, but the poor response rate may indicate that lessons are not being learned.

FTIR confirmed the presence of Si-O, Si-Al, Al-O, and metal oxygen bonds. SEM/EDX revealed a cubic morphology with some bigger particles that are mono dispersed and partially spherical, along with different compositions of the elements present. XRD showed a face-centered cubic (FCC) structure with 25.73 nm lattice, while XRF confirmed the presence of SiO2, Al2 O3 as well as with different major and trace metal oxides.

The main way to deal with this insect is to use insecticides. Due to the resistance from insecticides, the fight against house flies has been hampered. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies worldwide. Methods: This study was conducted via a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies. Accordingly, by searching the databases of Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Proquest, Bioone, and Embase, all published articles were extracted, and reviewed until the end of May 2022. Statistical data analysis was performed using the random-effects model in the meta-analysis, meta-regression, and I2 index. Results: Nine studies entered the meta-analysis process. Based on this, the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticide in house flies was estimated to be 49.1%. Meta-regression showed that the prevalence of knockdown resistance increased with increasing years of study but decreased with increasing sample size. Conclusion: According to the findings, about 50% of house flies have knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticide. As a result, it is necessary to adopt effective and combined methods to combat this insect to control it and prevent the transmission of diseases caused by it. © 2023","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: M.D. Moemenbellah-Fard; Research Center for Health Sciences, Institute of Health, Dept. of Biology and Control of Disease Vectors, School of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; email: momenbf@sums.ac.ir",10.1016/j.parepi.2023.e00310,Housefly;Knockdown resistance;Musca domestica;Organochlorine insecticide;organochlorine insecticide;allele;data base;gene;genetic association;house fly;insecticide resistance;kdr gene;nonhuman;prevalence;Review;sample size;vector control,NA,,organochlorine knockdownresistance kdr association in housefly musca domestica a systematic review and metaanalysis

Strategies to monitor this stress hormone and its correlation to food quality and security have been studied in fish farming and the livestock industry. This review discusses studies on monitoring cortisol in the food industry for the first time. The impact of cortisol on animal production, quality, and the security of food products, and the analytical procedures commonly implemented for sample pre-concentration and quantification by liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry, are reviewed and discussed according to the results published in the period 2012–2022. Aquaculture, or fish farming, is the leading agri-food sector, where cortisol’s impact and usefulness are better known than in livestock. The determination of cortisol in fish not only allows for an increase in the production rate, but also the ability to monitor the water quality, enhancing the sustainable development of this industry. In cattle, further studies are needed since it has mainly been used to detect the administration of illicit substances.

In this research, the combined toxicity of polyvinyl chloride (PVC) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) to Microcystis aeruginosa was investigated. The results indicated that the combination of these pollutants inhibited the growth of M. aeruginosa and promoted the synthesis and release of Microcystin-LR (MC-LR). Individual and combined exposure caused different responses to cellular oxidative stress. Under the Individual exposure of PFOA, when the concentration was greater than 20.0 mg/L, the catalase (CAT) activity increased significantly, and when it was greater than 100.0 mg/L, the malondialdehyde (MDA) content increased significantly, but there is no significant change under combined exposure. PVC and PFOA exposure also caused physical damage to the algal cells and reduced the content of extracellular polymer substances (EPS) based on analysis of cell morphology.

Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) play an important role in releasing MPs to the environment. Therefore, understanding the occurrence, fate, and removal mechanism of MPs in WWTPs is of great importance towards microplastie control. In this review, the occurrence characteristics and removal rates of MPs in 78 WWTPs from 57 studies were discussed based on Metaanalysis. Specifically, the key aspects regarding MPs removal in WWTPs, such as wastewater treatment processes and MPs shapes, sizes, and polymer compositions were analyzed and compared. The results showed that; CD the abundances of MPs in the influent and effluent were 1.56×10-2-3.14 ×10-4n·L-1and 1.70×10-3-3.09×102n·L-1, respectively. The abundance of MPs in the sludge ranged from 1. 80 × 10-1to 9.38 × 103n·g-1. (2) The total removal rate (>90% ) of MPs by WWTPs using oxidation ditch, biofilm, and conventional activated sludge treatment processes was higher than that using sequencing batch activated sludge, anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic, and anoxic-aerobic processes. (3) The removal rate of MPs in primary, secondary, and tertiary treatment process were 62.87%, 55.78%, and 58.45%, respectively. The combination process of ""grid + sedimentation tank + primary sedimentation tank"" had the highest removal rate towards MPs in primary treatment processes, and the membrane bioreactor had the highest one beyond other secondary treatment processes. Filtration was the best process in tertiary treatment. (4) The film, foam, and fragment MPs were easier to remove (>90% ) than fiber and spherical (<90%) MPs by WWTPs.

Case report: A 79-year-old woman was admitted to the emergency department a poorly defined with symptoms of fever, dysuria, hematuria, and pain and swelling in her right knee. Microbiological studies indicated the presence of Escherichia coli in blood cultures, urine cultures, and synovial fluid cultures of the right knee. A computed tomography scan revealed nonspecific bladder thickening, which was further confirmed by a cystoscopy. A poorly defined lesion in the trigone was resected, and subsequent pathological examination revealed the presence of malacoplakia without evidence of malignancy. The patient was treated with antibiotic therapy, and the hematuria eventually resolved. Systematic review: We conducted a comprehensive search in the Medline, EMBASE, and WoS databases from January 1, 1993, to January 1, 2023, for articles that focused on Malacoplakia, involved human subjects. Were included 32 articles reporting on 35 cases of urinary bladder malacoplakia. The majority of those diagnosed with bladder malacoplakia were women under the age of 50, with recurrent urinary tract infections and immunosuppressive conditions as frequent comorbidities. Positive cultures showed Escherichia coli (E. coli) in 72% of cases. Successful outcomes were achieved in 26 cases (74.3%). Discussion: Malacoplakia is triggered by an inadequate immune system response to lower urinary tract infections. Diagnosis requires prior biopsies before resection or more aggressive treatments. Appropriate treatment of urinary tract infections with antibiotics targeted at gram-negative bacteria is essential for treating malacoplakia. © 2023 Sociedad Mexicana de Urologia.

The economies of many cocoa producing nations, particularly those in the developing world, are supported by cocoa export revenue. To ensure satisfactory yields, however, the plant is usually intensely treated with pesticides because it is vulnerable to disease and pest attacks. Even though pesticides help protect the cocoa plant, unintended environmental contamination is also likely. Honey, produced from nectar obtained by honeybees from flowers while foraging, can serve as a good indicator for the level of pesticide residues and environmental pesticide build-up in landscapes. Here, we use a systematic literature review to quantify the extent of research on residues of pesticides used in cocoa cultivation in honey. In 81% of the 104 studies examined for this analysis, 169 distinct compounds were detected. Imidacloprid was the most frequently detected pesticide, making neonicotinoids the most frequently found class of pesticides overall. However, in cocoa producing countries, organophosphates, organochlorines, and pyrethroids were the most frequently detected pesticides. Interestingly, only 19% of studies were carried out in cocoa producing countries. We recommend prioritizing more research in the countries that produce cocoa to help to understand the potential impact of pesticide residues linked with cocoa cultivation in honey and the environment more generally to inform better pesticide usage, human health, and environmental policies. © 2023 Boakye et al.

We combine the model with two Constraint-Based Reconstruction and Analysis (COBRA) methods that use transcriptomics data to predict growth rates and fluxes: E-Flux2 and SPOT (Simplified Pearson Correlation with Transcriptomic data). Growth rates are best predicted by E-Flux2. Flux profiles are more accurately predicted by E-Flux2 than flux balance analysis (FBA) and parsimonious FBA (pFBA), when compared to 44 central carbon fluxes measured by 13C-Metabolic Flux Analysis (13C-MFA). Under glucose-fed conditions, E-Flux2 presents an R2 value of 0.54, while predictions based on pFBA had an inferior R2 of 0.28. We attribute this improved performance to the extra activity information provided by the transcriptomics data. For phenol-fed metabolism, in which the substrate first enters the TCA cycle, E-Flux2's flux predictions display a high R2 of 0.96 while pFBA showed an R2 of 0.93. We also show that glucose metabolism and phenol metabolism function with similar relative ATP maintenance costs.

Malaria was previously hyperendemic in Hainan Province. Due to large-scale anti-malarial intervention, malaria elimination in the province was achieved in 2019. This paper reviews the literature on the ecology, bionomics, and control of malaria vectors in Hainan from 1951 to 2021. We searched PubMed, and the China national knowledge infrastructure (CNKI) database for relevant articles published and included three other important books published in Chinese or English in order to summarize research on species, distribution, vectorial capacity, ecology, the resistance of malaria vectors to insecticides, and malaria vector control in Hainan Province. A total of 239 references were identified, 79 of which met the criteria for inclusion in our review. A total of six references dealt with the salivary gland infection of Anophelines, six with vectorial capacity, 41 with mosquito species and distribution, seven with seasonality, three with blood preference, four with nocturnal activity, two with flight distance, 13 with resistance to insecticides, and 14 with vector control. Only 16 published papers met the criteria of addressing malaria vectors in Hainan over the last 10 years (2012–2021). Anopheles dirus and Anopheles minimus are primary malaria vectors, mainly distributed in the southern and central areas of Hainan. Indoor residual spraying with DDT and the use of ITNs with pyrethroid insecticides were the main interventions taken for malaria control. Previous studies on ecology, bionomics, and resistance of vectors provided scientific evidence for optimizing malaria vector control and contributed to malaria elimination in Hainan Province. We hope our study will contribute to preventing malaria reestablishment caused by imported malaria in Hainan. Research on malaria vectors should be updated to provide scientific evidence for malaria vector control strategies post-elimination as the ecology, bionomics, and resistance of vectors to insecticides may change with changes in the environment. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: Y.

The presence of PFAS in ground and surface water can create a route for PFAS to enter the soil, exposing ecosystems (including agroecosystems), where they will move through the food web via biomagnification. The toxicity of PFAS to plants, particularly in agricultural ecosystems, is of emerging concern due to the application of biosolids that are often contaminated with PFAS. Nevertheless, due to the low concentrations of PFAS in most agricultural soils, the direct impact of PFAS on plant health is not well understood. We used 1H-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to explore the effects of exposure of two key PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism. We found that Arabidopsis exhibited an accumulation of multiple metabolites, including soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose), multiple amino acids, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, suggesting that PFAS exposure impacts the metabolism of plants by causing an accumulation of stress-related amino acids and soluble sugars that drives increased activity of the TCA cycle. The present study shows that 1H-NMR metabolomics is a viable tool for investigating changes in the metabolic profile of plants exposed to PFAS and can be used to illuminate the stress response of plants in a high-throughput, nonbiased manner.

Acinetobacter baumannii is a nosocomial pathogen that has emerged as a global threat because of its high levels of resistance to many antibiotics, particularly those considered as last-resort antibiotics, such as carbapenems. Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) play an important role in the dissemination and expression of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs), including the mobilization of ARGs within and between species. We conducted an in-depth, systematic investigation of the occurrence and dissemination of ARGs associated with MGEs in A. baumannii. We focused on a cross-sectoral approach that integrates humans, animals, and environments. Four strategies for the prevention of ARG dissemination through MGEs have been discussed: prevention of airborne transmission of ARGs using semi-permeable membrane-covered thermophilic composting; application of nanomaterials for the removal of emerging pollutants (antibiotics) and pathogens; tertiary treatment technologies for controlling ARGs and MGEs in wastewater treatment plants; and the removal of ARGs by advanced oxidation techniques. This review contemplates and evaluates the major drivers involved in the transmission of ARGs from the cross-sectoral perspective and ARG-transfer prevention processes. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 14; Correspondence Address: S.H.

Our researchers assess the quality of the included studies and their risk of bias using the recommended method and tool. This study uses meta-analyses of the random effects of each exposure and outcome to estimate combined odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We found that the risk of hyperuricemia was strongly associated with three perfluorinated compounds, PFNA, PFOA, and PFOS, with the OR(95%CI) of 1.26 (1.07–1.47), 1.44(1.15–1.79), and 1.23(1.01–1.50) respectively. We also found a weak association between two other perfluorinated compounds, PFDA and PFHxS. Other than that, the summary ORs (95% CIs) of incident hyperuricemia were 2.34 (1.79–3.08) for DDT, 3.25(2.40–4.39) for DDE, 2.57 (1.37–4.81) for PCBs and 3.05(2.22–4.19) in trans-nonanchlor. Therefore, DDT and its breakdown product, DDE, PCBs, and trans-nonanchlor have also been linked with an increased risk of hyperuricemia in humans. This study finds that persistent organic pollutant is a critical factor for hyperuricemia, and further studies in specific regions will be considered in the future. © 2023 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: Y.

A two-phase study with an epidemiological and an ecological assessment was performed. The epidemiological phase was carried out with a descriptive cross-sectional study among citizens from Mexico City and the metropolitan area using an electronic survey applied to 719 subjects aimed to assess practices in which pharmaceutical products are disposed. The ecological phase included a review of scientific reports. The results show that nearly 83.5% of those surveyed use inappropriate practices for disposal medicines, the main ones are through the municipal dump or directly in the drain. The ecological approach was carried out by a systematic literature review of original reports published between 2013 to 2023; information about the class of drugs, active substance, environmental compartments, location, and concentration was extracted and presented. Fifty-one different types of pharmaceutical residues were detected in wastewater in Mexico City in the last decade.

Articles between the years 2000 and 2020 were collected. Two different reviewers performed a blind selection of the studies using the Rayyan QCRI web app. Post-completion, the selected articles were extracted and analyzed via the RedCap platform. Our review resulted in 2719 articles, of which 51 were included in the meta-analysis, resulting in an overall OR of 1.27 (95% CI 1.04–1.55). Furthermore, it was observed that the main occupation associated with the increased risk of NHL was that in which workers are exposed to pesticides.

We determined whether specific metabolites, oxidative stress indicators, enzyme activity, and fatty acid (FA) profiles in milk can serve as indicators of negative EB. Forty-two multiparous Holstein dairy cows were divided at calving into 2 groups: one was milked 3 times daily and the other, twice a day for the first 30 d in milk (DIM). Cows were classified retrospectively as being in either negative EB (NEB, n = 19; the mean EB during the first 21 DIM were less than the overall median of −2.8 Mcal/d), or in positive EB (PEB, n = 21; the mean EB was ≥−2.8 Mcal/d). The daily milk yield, feed intake, and body weight were recorded individually. Blood samples were analyzed for metabolites and stress biomarkers. Milk samples were taken twice weekly from 5 to 45 DIM to analyze the milk solids, the FA profile, glucose, glucose-6-P (G6P), G6P-dehydrogenase (G6PDH) activity, malic and lactic acids, malondialdehyde (MDA), and oxygen radical antioxidant capacity (ORAC). The NEB cows produced 10.5% more milk, and consumed 7.6% less dry matter than the PEB cows. The plasma glucose concentration was greater and β-hydroxybutyrate was lower in the PEB vs. the NEB cows. The average concentrations of milk glucose, G6P, malic and lactic acids, and MDA did not differ between groups; however, the G6PDH activity was higher and ORAC tended to be higher in the milk of NEB vs. the PEB cows. The correlation between milk G6PDH activity and EB was significant (r = −0.39). The percentages of oleic acid and total unsaturated FA in milk were higher for the NEB vs. the PEB cows. These findings indicate that G6PDH activity in milk is associated with NEB and that it can serve as a non-invasive candidate biomarker of NEB in postpartum cows, that should be validated in future studies. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.

However, due to the limitations concerning the use of the developed materials and the applied photodegradation conditions, the research on photoremediation using TiO2 often stays behind the lab door. The challenge is to convert the basic research into a successful innovation, leading to the implementation of this process into wastewater treatment. For this purpose, the most active materials and optimal photodegradation conditions must be chosen. This article collects and compares the studies on photocatalytic degradation of an emerging pollutant – sulfamethoxazole, an antibacterial drug – and attempts to find the best approaches to be successfully applied on an industrial scale. Various types of TiO2-based photocatalysts are compared, including different nanoforms, doped or polymer-based composites, composites with graphene, activated carbon, dyes or natural compounds, as well as possible supporting materials for TiO2. The paper covers the impact of the irradiation source (natural sunlight, LED, mercury or xenon lamps) and water matrix on the photodegradation process, considering the ecological and economic sustainability of the process. Emphasis is put on the stability, ease of separation and reuse of the photocatalyst, power and safety of the irradiation source, identification of photodegradation intermediates and toxicity assays.

Therefore, we aimed to study the relationship between PFAS exposure during pregnancy and ADHD and ASD in offspring based on meta-analyses. Online databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science, were searched comprehensively for eligible studies conducted before July 2021. Eleven studies (up to 8493 participants) were included in this analysis.

Negative associations were observed between perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and ADHD/ASD, including between perfluorononanoate (PFNA) and ASD. There were no associations found between total PFAS concentration groups and neurobehavioral problems. The trial sequential analyses showed unstable results.

OBJECTIVES: The objective of this meta-analysis was to summarize associations between PFAS and blood lipids in adults. METHODS: A literature search was conducted on PubMed and Web of Science for articles published through 13 May 2022 that examined associations between PFAS and blood lipids, including total cholesterol (TC), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and triacylglycerols (TGs). Inclusion criteria included the presence of associations between five PFAS (PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFDA, and PFNA) and four blood lipid measures (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C, and TGs) in adults. Data on study characteristics and PFAS–lipid associations were extracted. Assessments of individual study quality were performed. Associations of changes of blood lipid levels corresponding to 1 interquartile range (IQR)-unit increase of blood PFAS levels were pooled using random effects models. Dose–response relationships were examined. RESULTS: Twenty-nine publications were included in the present analyses. Every IQR increase of PFOA was significantly associated with a 2:1-mg=dL increase in TC (95% CI: 1.2, 3.0), a 1:3-mg=dL increase in TGs (95% CI: 0.1, 2.4), and a 1:4-mg=dL increase in LDL-C (95% CI: 0.6, 2.2). PFOS was also significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels, and the corresponding values were 2.6 (95% CI: 1.5, 3.6) and 1.9 (95% CI: 0.9, 3.0), respectively. Associations of PFOS and PFOA with HDL-C levels were largely null. For minor PFAS species, PFHxS was significantly associated with higher levels of HDL-C [0.8 (95% CI: 0.5, 1.2)]. Inverse associations were observed between PFDA and TGs [−5:0 (95% CI: −8:1, −1:9)] and between PFNA and TGs [−1:7 (95% CI: −3:5, −0:02)], whereas a positive association was observed between PFDA and HDL-C [1.4 (95% CI: 0.1, 2.7)]. Nonsignificant nonlinear dose–response relationships were identified for associations of PFOA and PFOS with certain blood lipids. DISCUSSION: PFOA and PFOS were significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels in adults. Whether these findings may translate into an elevated cardiovascular disease risk associated with PFAS exposure warrants further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11840. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Because limited information about the disposition of PCBs following inhalation exposure is available, this study investigated the disposition of 2,2′,5,5′-tetrachlorobiphenyl (PCB52) and its metabolites in rats following acute, nose-only inhalation of PCB52. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (50-58 days of age, 210 ± 27 g; n = 6) were exposed for 4 h by inhalation to approximately 14 or 23 μg/kg body weight of PCB52 using a nose-only exposure system. Sham animals (n = 6) were exposed to filtered lab air. Based on gas chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS), PCB52 was present in adipose, brain, intestinal content, lung, liver, and serum. 2,2′,5,5′-Tetrachlorobiphenyl-4-ol (4-OH-PCB52) and one unknown monohydroxylated metabolite were detected in these compartments except for the brain. Liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) analysis identified several metabolites, including sulfated, methoxylated, and dechlorinated PCB52 metabolites. These metabolites were primarily found in the liver (7 metabolites), lung (9 metabolites), and serum (9 metabolites) due to the short exposure time. These results demonstrate for the first time that complex mixtures of sulfated, methoxylated, and dechlorinated PCB52 metabolites are formed in adolescent rats following PCB52 inhalation, laying the groundwork for future animal studies of the adverse effects of inhaled PCB52. © 2024 The Authors.

However, the metabolic pathways linking PFAS exposure and human disease are unclear. OBJECTIVE: We examined associations of PFAS mixtures with alterations in metabolic pathways in independent cohorts of adolescents and young adults. METHODS: Three hundred twelve overweight/obese adolescents from the Study of Latino Adolescents at Risk (SOLAR) and 137 young adults from the Southern California Children’s Health Study (CHS) were included in the analysis. Plasma PFAS and the metabolome were determined using liquid-chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry. A metabolome-wide association study was performed on log-transformed metabolites using Bayesian regression with a g-prior specification and g-computation for modeling exposure mixtures to estimate the impact of exposure to a mixture of six ubiquitous PFAS (PFOS, PFHxS, PFHpS, PFOA, PFNA, and PFDA). Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Mummichog and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Significance across cohorts was determined using weighted Z-tests. RESULTS: In the SOLAR and CHS cohorts, PFAS exposure was associated with alterations in tyrosine metabolism (meta-analysis p = 0:00002) and de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (p = 0:03), among others. For example, when increasing all PFAS in the mixture from low (∼ 30th percentile) to high (∼ 70th percentile), thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone related to tyrosine metabolism, increased by 0.72 standard deviations (SDs; equivalent to a standardized mean difference) in the SOLAR cohort (95% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 0.00, 1.20) and 1.60 SD in the CHS cohort (95% BCI: 0.39, 2.80). Similarly, when going from low to high PFAS exposure, arachidonic acid increased by 0.81 SD in the SOLAR cohort (95% BCI: 0.37, 1.30) and 0.67 SD in the CHS cohort (95% BCI: 0.00, 1.50). In general, no individual PFAS appeared to drive the observed associations. DISCUSSION: Exposure to PFAS is associated with alterations in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in adolescents and young adults. https:// doi.org/10.1289/EHP11372. © 2023, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Currently, most of the reviewed literatures mainly focus on the distribution in various environmental media, adsorption mechanisms with different pollutants, and characterization of MPs. Therefore, the present review mainly highlights the characterization techniques of MPs and the underlying mechanisms of their combination with conventional coexisting substances (heavy metals, organic pollutants, and nutrients). We observed that massive MP pollution has been found in many areas, especially in Africa, Asia, India, South Africa, North America and Europe. The separation methods of MPs in different environmental media are basically similar, including sampling, pre-treatment, flotation, filtration and digestion. The combination of multiple characterization technologies can more precisely identify the shape, abundance, colour, and particle size of MPs. Notably, although recent reports have confirmed that MPs can act as carriers of heavy metals and carry them into organisms to cause harm, MPs have different adsorption and desorption characteristics for various heavy metals. The adsorption capacity of organic pollutants onto MPs is closely related to their hydrophobicity, specific surface area and functional group characteristics. The relative abundance of MPs in sediments and lakes had a significantly positive correlation with the mass concentration of total nitrogen in lake water, but this finding still needs to be further verified. Based on current research, we suggest that future MP research should focus on characterization technology, environmental migration, ecological effects, health risks and degradation methods. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 23; Correspondence Address: X.

In order to develop new photocatalytic materials with strong activity, good visible light absorption performance, and high stability, and achieve efficient degradation of PFOA in water, research progress in the preparation of photocatalytic degradation materials of PFOA in the past twenty years was systematically reviewed. The degradation characteristics and existing problems of different photocatalytic degradation materials were comprehensively analyzed. The reaction mechanism and activity enhancement mechanism of photocatalytic degradation materials were summarized, combined with the existing materials of photocatalytic degradation of PFOA, and eventually the photocatalytic degradation pathway of PFOA was clarified. © 2023 Journal of Central South University (Medical Sciences).

However, the phases of Fe-based catalysts in such a process are highly dynamic and complex, and conventional characterizations cannot capture the accurate real-time information in the pretreatment reaction. Therefore, it is necessary and desired to apply various in-situ characterizations in this process, because they can obtain the dynamic changes of phase, morphology, surface structure and properties of the catalyst. And then a relationship between the pretreatment process and the subsequent catalytic performance of FTS will be effectively and reasonably established. This review presents a systematic summary of the experimental and data processing methods in in-situ characterizations of X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, infrared spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy during the pretreatment of Fe-based FTS catalysts. These characterizations can clarify the complex structure and surface property changes of catalyst precursors and thus will facilitate the design and development of more efficient Fe-based FTS catalysts. © 2023 Science Press.

Objective: We evaluated the association between modifiable and non-modifiable gestational and prenatal risk factors that affect the AD prevalence in children. Methods: We performed the systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies (n=27) in PubMed and EMBASE (2000~2021). A meta-analysis was performed using random-effects models to estimate pooled odds ratios (OR) or hazard ratio (HR). We performed a systematic review according to Preferred Reporting Item for Systematic Review and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines and summarized cohort studies investigating gestational and prenatal risk factor those predispose to AD in off spring. Leading modifiable and non-modifiable were identified through ORs. Meta-analysis using the random effect model was also conducted to provide an overall estimate for several significant factors. Results: Among the non-modifiable risk factors gestational diabetes (7.2, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.4~34.5), maternal history of allergy (2.14, 95% CI: 1.54~2.97) and prenatal history of eczema (2.46, 95% CI: 1.0~5.8) were found as major determining risk factors in early manifestation of AD in children. Further, maternal exposure to industrial products (1.89, 95% CI: 1.10~3.16), exposure to antibiotics during pregnancy (3.59, 95% CI: 1.19~10.85) and passive smoking during pregnancy (2.60, 95% CI: 1.11~6.1) are leading causes of early AD manifestation. Conclusion: Conclusively, both genetic and environmental factors play a pivotal role in early manifestation of AD.

Objective: To investigate the potential mediating role of neonatal metabolites in the relationship between prenatal PFAS exposure and childhood adiposity trajectories in the first four years of life. Methods: We analyzed the data for 1671 mother-child pairs from the Shanghai Birth Cohort study. We included those with PFAS exposure information in early pregnancy, neonatal metabolites data and at least three child anthropometric measurements at 6, 12, 24 and/or 48 months. Body mass index (BMI) z-score trajectories were identified using latent class growth mixture modeling. The associations between PFAS concentrations and trajectory classes were assessed using multinomial logistic regression. Screening and penalization-based selection was used to identify neonatal amino acids and acylcarnitines with significant mediation effects. Results: Three BMI z-score trajectories in early childhood were identified: a persistent increase trajectory (Class 1, 2.2 %), a stable trajectory (Class 2, 66 %), and a transient increase trajectory (Class 3, 32 %). Increased odds of being in Class 1 were observed in association with one log-unit increase in concentrations of perfluorooctane sulfonate (odds ratio [OR], 1.76 [95 % CI, 0.96–3.23], Class 2 as reference; OR, 2.36 [95 % CI, 1.27–4.40], Class 3 as reference), perfluorononanoic acid (OR, 1.90 [95 % CI, 0.97–3.72], Class 2 as reference; OR, 2.23 [95 % CI, 1.12–4.42], Class 3 as reference) and perfluorodecanoic acid (OR, 1.95 [95 % CI, 1.12–3.38], Class 2 as reference; OR, 2.14 [95 % CI, 1.22–3.76], Class 3 as reference). The effect of prenatal PFAS exposure on being in Class 1 was significantly but partly mediated by octanoylcarnitine (2.64 % for perfluorononanoic acid and 3.70 % for sum of 10 PFAS). Conclusions: In utero PFAS exposure is a risk factor for persistent growth in BMI z-score in early childhood.

It functions to provide passage of light, be a viscoelastic dampener, and hold the retina in place. Vitreous liquefaction causes retinal detachment and retinal tears requiring pars plana vitrectomy for vitreous substitution. An ideal vitreous substitute should display similar mechanical, chemical, and rheological properties to the natural vitreous. Currently used vitreous substitutes such as silicone oil, perfluorocarbon liquids, and gases cannot be used long-term due to adverse effects such as poor retention time, cytotoxicity, and cataract formation. Long-term, experimental vitreous substitutes composed of natural, modified and synthetic polymers are currently being studied. This review discusses current long- and short-term vitreous substitutes and the disadvantages of these that have highlighted the need for an ideal vitreous substitute. The review subsequently focuses specifically on currently used polysaccharide- and synthetic polymer-based vitreous substitutes, which may be modified or functionalised, or employed as the derivative, and discusses experimental vitreous substitutes in these classes. The advantages and challenges associated with the use of polymeric substitutes are discussed.

It has recently been classified as a hematopoietic tumour, and the cases of ECD reported in the literature has dramatically increased during the last 15 years. (2) Methods: We describe the case of a 57-year-old male patient with severe gynecomastia, with a detailed description of his diagnostic iter and consequent surgical operation. We provide the first systematic review of the literature of breast involvement in ECD, following PRISMA guidelines, including 13 studies and 16 patients. (3) Results: Our report resulted to be the first case of gynecomastia as a single clinical and imaging feature of ECD described in English literature. A total of 81.3% of patients included were female. Among them, 76.9% had unilateral and nodular presentation, while male patients presented bilateral heterogeneous breast enlargement. Globally, 87.5% expressed breast alterations as their first manifestations of ECD. Only 50% presented skeletal involvement. (4) Conclusion: The reported case represents a unique addition to the literature. We found two different patterns in ECD-related breast involvement between male and female patients, an unusual M/F ratio, and a lower rate of bone involvement. Breast involvement is frequently the first clinical feature; therefore, breast caregivers should be aware of this dangerous and most likely underestimated condition. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: F.R.

Experimental and epidemiological studies have shown potential links between exposure to environmental toxicants and poor male fertility. Some environmental exposures in utero can disrupt fetal testicular function and result in cryptorchidism, low semen quality, low serum testosterone levels, and low fertility. Environmental exposure in childhood and adulthood can also adversely affect germ cells, Sertoli cells, Leydig cells, or the hypothalamic-pituitary-testicular axis, resulting in impaired male fertility. In this review, we report the latest results from human studies that investigated the role of endocrine disrupting chemicals, heavy metals, tobacco smoking, alcohol drinking, and use of marijuana in low semen quality and impaired male fertility.

Studies on MP-sorbed organic pollutants lack methodological standardization, resulting in a low comparability and replicability. In this work, we reviewed 40 field studies of MP-sorbed organic contaminants using PRISMA guidelines for acquiring information on sampling and analytical protocols. The papers were also scored for their reliability on the basis of 7 criteria, from 0 (minimum) to 21 (maximum). Our results showed a great heterogeneity of the methods used for the sample collection, MPs extraction, and instruments for chemicals’ identification. Measures for cross-contamination control during MPs analysis were strictly applied only in 13% of the studies, indicating a need for quality control in MPs-related research. The most frequently detected MP-sorbed chemicals were polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). Most of the studies showed a good reliability (>75% of the total score), with 32 papers scoring 16 or higher. On the basis of the collected information, a standardizable protocol for the detection of MPs and MP-sorbed chemicals has been suggested for improving the reliability of MPs monitoring studies. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: A.

In addition to their role in vascular homeostasis, extracellular vesicles also appear to play an important role in atherogenesis, including monocyte transmigration and foam cell formation, SMC proliferation and migration, leukocyte transmigration, and thrombosis. Peripheral arterial disease, a major form of peripheral vascular disease, is characterized by structural or functional impairment of peripheral arterial supply, often secondary to atherosclerosis. Elevated levels of extracellular vesicles have been demonstrated in patients with peripheral arterial disease and implicated in the development of atherosclerosis within peripheral vascular beds. However, extracellular vesicles also appear capable of delivering cargo with atheroprotective effects. This capability has been exploited in vesicles engineered to carry content capable of neovascularization, suggesting potential for therapeutic angiogenesis. This dual capacity holds substantial promise for diagnosis and therapy, including possibly limb- and life-saving options for peripheral arterial disease management. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: P.A.

We also performed review the literature (n=2253) as regards to clinicopathological and radiological features, treatment received, survival outcomes and prognostic factors. Median time from diagnosis of EOC to CNS metastasis was 27 months (range: 0 to 101 months). 33(80.5%) patients had FIGO stage III-IV at baseline and serous carcinoma (75.6%) was common pathology subtype. Thirteen (31.7%) patients had isolated CNS metastasis and 28 (68.3%) had intra-abdominal disease in addition. Nineteen (46.3%) patients achieved complete response post treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy.

To fill this gap, we investigated the variation of trichloroethylene (TCE) biodehalogenation activity in response to indigenous microbial community succession in EK-Bio by both column and batch experiments. For a 195 day EK-Bio column (∼1 V/cm, electrolyte circulation, lactate addition), biodehalogenation activity occurred first near the cathode (<60 days) and then spread to the anode (>90 days), which was controlled by electron acceptor (i.e., Fe(III)) competition and microbe succession.

Highly differentiated cells and multiple hormonal and molecular pathways are involved in this remodeling process that is unavoidably affected by normal aging. Apart from aging, several factors such as geographic variation, climate conditions, nutritional status, socioeconomic status, culture, pollution, and endocrine disruptors have been suggested to have a direct or indirect impact on bone metabolism and influence bone health. Τhe positive or negative effect of each one of these factors on bone health depends on many variables such as age of exposure, duration of exposure, and intensity of exposure but also on the combined effects of other cofactors. The pathogenetic mechanisms and the molecular pathways by which bone metabolism is affected have not always been clarified. Therefore, in this chapter, we aim to summarize the current literature on the influence of environmental factors on bone metabolism and disease and to review any recent updates in research about the impact of endocrine disruptors on bone health. © 2023, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.

Soil physical and chemical properties can indicate soil quality because they affect soil microbial activity. This study used an exploratory observational method to analyze the diversity and abundance of microbes in the soil microbiome of pesticide paddy fields (PPF) and non-pesticide paddy fields (PF). The PPF samples were taken from Purwosari Village, Mijen Subdistrict, Semarang City, while the PF samples were taken from Tambangan Village, Mijen Subdistrict, Semarang City. Soil samples were taken for chemical and metagenomic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene marker region V3-V4. The results showed that microbial PPF diversity was higher than PF's based on the Shannon and Simpson index. The PPF microbiome is dominated by 3 bacterial phyla, namely Proteobacteria (26.61%), Actinobacteriota (15.13%) and Acidobacteriota (11.44%). Meanwhile, the PF microbiome was dominated by Proteobacteria (28.73%), Acidobacteriota (12.80%), and Chloroflexi (11.41%). The Archaea phylum that dominates PPF are Halobacterota (62.78%), Euryarchaeota (20.82%), and Crenarchaeota (10.89%), while in PF it is dominated by Halobacterota (80.43%), Crenarchaeota (11.03%) and Euryarchaeota (5.04%). The phylum that plays an important role in the biodegradation of organochlorine pesticides is Actinobacteria, which dominates in PPF; low abundance of Nitrospirota in PPF as a bioindicator of organochlorine pesticide contamination. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Anaerobic DCM-dechlorinating bacteria use the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, yet dechlorination reaction mechanisms remain unclear and the enzyme(s) responsible for carbon-chlorine bond cleavage have not been definitively identified. Of the three bacterial taxa known to carry out anaerobic dechlorination of DCM, ‘Candidatus Formimonas warabiya’ strain DCMF is the only organism that can also ferment non-chlorinated substrates, including quaternary amines (i.e., choline and glycine betaine) and methanol. Strain DCMF is present within enrichment culture DFE, which was derived from an organochlorine-contaminated aquifer. We utilized the metabolic versatility of strain DCMF to carry out comparative metaproteomics of cultures grown with DCM or glycine betaine. This revealed differential abundance of numerous proteins, including a methyltransferase gene cluster (the mec cassette) that was significantly more abundant during DCM degradation, as well as highly conserved amongst anaerobic DCM-degrading bacteria. This lends strong support to its involvement in DCM dechlorination. A putative glycine betaine methyltransferase was also discovered, adding to the limited knowledge about the fate of this widespread osmolyte in anoxic subsurface environments. Furthermore, the metagenome of enrichment culture DFE was assembled, resulting in five high quality and two low quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes. Metaproteogenomic analysis did not reveal any genes or proteins for utilization of DCM or glycine betaine in the cohabiting bacteria, supporting the previously held idea that they persist via necromass utilization.

In the present study, a sensitive and rapid high-performance thin-layer chromatography method was developed for the simultaneous determination of marmelosin, umbelliferone, and psoralen from the four different aerial parts of A. marmelos. The method uses HPTLC silica gel 60 RP-18 W plates as stationary phase, and acetonitrile: 0.1% orthophosphoric acid in water (1:1 v/v) as solvent system. The developed method is validated for specificity, precision, repeatability, and accuracy in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Further, the estimation of heavy metal suggested that the A. marmelos bark sample was highly contaminated with cadmium (3.8 ± 0.7 µg/g) which was far from the permissible range as described by World Health Organization (WHO). The observed chromium concentration was higher in the bark and the fruit than the normal range recorded in the plants. Arsenic and lead content was within the permissible range, while mercury was not detected in any of the tested samples. Studied samples were further tested for the presence of organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticides, as well as organophosphate and carbamates. Results suggested that gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) was more prominent and detected in the bark and the young twig samples. Carbamates were not detected in any of the samples.

This study aimed to analyze the literature concerning the immunohistological and ultrastructural features of DFs. It also related these features to the histogenesis of these lesions. Methods: This study included a PubMed literature search for studies addressing the clinicopathological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical features of DFs. It also presented some current cases of CD34-negative DFs and a subset of these lesions with aberrant expression of this protein. Results: Analysis of the PubMed literature revealed that DFs with an aberrant expression of CD34 are rare tumors that commonly affect the extremities of adult females. Separating these tumors from dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP, CD34-positive tumors) requires using a large panel of immunostains. Ultrastructurally, DFs are composed of diverse cell types, including cells with histiocytic, myofibroblastic, and fibroblastic features. An analysis of the DFs described by this study revealed that cases with an aberrant expression of CD34 protein had slightly high mean age and male sex predominance when compared to CD34-negative cases. The former commonly affected the extremities. There was no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis on follow-up.

The complexity results from transboundary interactions and reservoir nature that accumulates all forms of terrestrial washouts, marine and atmospheric pollutants such as dissolved and suspended organic, inorganic, and emerging pollutants. The aquatic ecosystem remains a gigantic habitat, transportation route, economic source, and strong buffer for all-natural and anthropogenic environmental turnovers, yet UNEP studies indicate that about 68% of “the environment-related sustainable development goal indicators” have data shortages to evaluate their progress. Therefore, sustainable access to informed data, accurate predictions, and aquatic pollution decisions presents an environmental challenge requiring global intervention. Thus, the availability of continuous, dynamic, and verifiable information supplements diverse, massive, and complex data flow for monitoring the state of the aquatic ecosystem. Storage of these big data requires volumes greater than terabytes, through computation methods that enable high speed and accuracy in accessing varieties of analytical information in real time. Big data presents a new era that gathers all resources, time-based information, and meta- and deeper analysis.

Zeno 35/39, Pisa, 56127, Italy","Background and Objective: Marine environments can be contaminated by various anthropogenic persistent organic pollutants, such as petroleum-related (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs), industrial (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyl, PCBs), and agriculture-related (e.g., organochlorine pesticides, OCPs) chemicals. Moreover, microplastic (MPs, particles < 5 mm) pollution of seawater is increasing in recent years and they can behave as a vehicle of chemicals acquired from the surrounding environment. Such MPs role is relevant from a public health perspective, increasing the exposure of beachgoers to harmful chemicals. In this paper, 40 field studies of MPs-sorbed organic pollutants were reviewed with the aim to understand the level of chemical contamination of MPs in the marine compartments. Methods: The literature search was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The keywords included microplastic in combination with the organic contaminants that could be adsorbed by MPs. Results: The methodology used for MPs-sorbed chemicals detection showed great differences among the studies, from sampling to analytical techniques. The most frequently searched chemicals were PCBs (55% of the reviewed papers) followed by PAHs (47.5%), and OCPs (42.5%). When such chemicals were searched, they were detected in almost one of the sampling sites included in each study. Overall, PCBs level showed a median concentration of 290 ng/g. The median PAH concentration was 3,595 ng/g, with an extremely high amount of 120,000 ng/g found in MPs from Chinese seawater. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was the most frequently detected OCP, with a median of 126.9 ng/g. Conclusion: This paper revealed that MPs can accumulate high level of chemicals in the marine environment, thus increasing the human exposure during swimming or rest on the beach. Despite the public health relevance of such human exposure, this topic is still little explored as demonstrated by the lack of standardized method for MPs collection and chemical analysis. © (2023), (European Publishing).

In this review article, we summarize the current literature on these roles before discussing the function of FPRs in the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis (OA), degenerative disc disease (DDD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, we discuss the potential diagnostic and therapeutic roles of FPRs in these domains. Methods: PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE searches were performed from 1965 through March 2022. Keywords included “FPR, tissue expression, inflammation, infection, musculoskeletal disorder, bone, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, mitochondria.” Results: Sixty-nine studies were included in this review article. FPRs appear to be ubiquitous in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of common musculoskeletal disorders. They can potentially be utilized for the earlier diagnosis of OA and DDD. They may be employed with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to reverse OA and DDD pathologies. With anti-inflammatory, anti-osteolytic, and pro-angiogenic functions, they may broaden treatment options in RA. Conclusions: FPRs appear to be heavily involved in the pathogenesis of common musculoskeletal conditions, including arthritis, degenerative disc disease, and rheumatoid arthritis.

The efficacy of Moringa oleifera biosorbent has been investigated in diverse research work using various techniques, including its adsorption capacity kinetic, thermodynamic evaluation, adsorbent modifications, and mechanism behind the adsorption process. The Langmuir isotherm provided the most remarkable experimental data fit for batch adsorption investigations, whereas the best fit was obtained with the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Furthermore, only a few papers that combined batch adsorption with fixed-bed column investigations were examined. In the latter articles, the scientists modified the adsorbent to increase the material’s adsorption capacity as determined by analytical methods, including IR spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). However, the raw material can show appreciable adsorption capacity values, proving moringa’s potency as a biosorbent. Hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, and van der Waals forces were the main processes in the found and reported adsorbent-adsorbate interactions. These mechanisms could change depending on the physiochemical nature of adsorption. Although frequently employed for heavy metal ions and dye adsorption, Moringa oleifera can still be explored in pesticide and medication adsorption investigations due to the few publications in this comprehensive review.

Some of the metals can have an adverse impact on the aquatic environment, even present in a lower concentration. The present study investigates the concentration of the selected heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As, and T-Hg) in Faunus ater (Mollusca, Gastropoda) that was collected from the rivers surrounding Universiti Malaysia Terengganu area. At each station, 25 individuals were collected. A total of 100 individuals of F. ater were collected at four different stations. The Teflon bomb digestion method was used to digest the samples after mixing them with 1.5 mL of suprapur nitric acid. Heavy metal concentration is analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), model Perkin Elmer Elan 9000, and the pollution status is evaluated by Pollution Load Index (PLI). The concentration of heavy metal is varied within the stations. The average concentration of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As, and T-Hg in F. ater was 29.7±1.29 μg/g dry wt., 42.1±7.77 μg/g dry wt., 0.26±0.04 μg/g dry wt., 0.58±0.08 μg/g dry wt., 2.17±021 μg/g dry wt. and 0.19±0.04 μg/g dry wt., respectively. One-way ANOVA test shows that for metal Cu, Zn, Pb, and As, there is no statistically significant difference in all stations (p > 0.05). A positive correlation of Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb is observed with the size of F. ater, suggesting that the bioaccumulation process occurs in the F. ater. For metal and metal correlation, only Zn-Cd shows a moderate correlation compared to other metals and indicates that metals from the study area come from different sources of pollutants. The PLI value in the study area was recorded below 50, which indicated no detailed survey is needed.

Here, glucose turnover is of special interest, as proinflammatory immune cells mainly utilize glycolysis to meet their energy needs. Noninvasive approaches to monitor both processes would help elucidate this interwoven relationship to identify new therapeutic targets and diagnostic opportunities. Methods: For induction of defined inflammatory hotspots, LPS-doped Matrigel plugs were implanted into the neck of C57BL/6J mice. Subsequently, 1H/19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to track the recruitment of 19F-loaded immune cells to the inflammatory focus and deuterium (2H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to monitor the metabolic fate of [6,6-2H2]glucose within the affected tissue. Histology and flow cytometry were used to validate the in vivo data. Results: After plug implantation and intravenous administration of the 19F-containing contrast agent, 1H/19F MRI confirmed the infiltration of 19F-labeled immune cells into LPS-doped plugs while no 19F signal was observed in PBS-containing control plugs. Identification of the inflammatory focus was followed by i.p. bolus injection of deuterated glucose and continuous 2H MRS. Inflammation-induced alterations in metabolic fluxes could be tracked with an excellent temporal resolution of 2 min up to approximately 60 min after injection and demonstrated a more anaerobic glucose utilization in the initial phase of immune cell recruitment. Conclusion: 1H/2H/19F MRI/MRS was successfully employed for noninvasive monitoring of metabolic alterations in an inflammatory environment, paving the way for simultaneous in vivo registration of immunometabolic data in basic research and patients.

In addition, it is suspected of having carcinogenic properties. BPA is used in the manufacture of several everyday products and, as a result, its discharge into the environment is expected. Thus, it is found in surface water, groundwater, and seawater at concentrations ranging from 5 to 200ng/L, which are potentially harmful to humans and wildlife. Therefore, the removal of BPA from industrial wastewater to avoid BPA environmental pollution is a matter of serious worldwide concern. The conventional wastewater treatment processes are costly and inefficient for the removal of BPA. This has driven the search for alternative methods such as those based on oxidative enzymes. In this context, laccases are attracting increasing interest in the last decades due to their broad substrate specificity and the fact that they only need molecular oxygen to exert their catalytic action producing water as the only by-product. This approach is believed to be a promising technology since it is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and does not produce sludge. Detailed characterization of the intermediates and metabolites produced during enzymatic degradation of BPA as well as toxicity studies are of great importance to assess the effectiveness of the biodegradation process. This review reports the metabolites found by different researchers in the degradation of BPA by laccase enzymes. © 2023 Elsevier Inc.

Although they are considered as reactive proliferations, their exact pathophysiology remains unknown and, therefore, they lack a specific treatment. Aims: The aim of this study is to review the evidence on cases of histiocytosis treated with UVB and/or UVA and to report a new case of relapsing group C histiocytosis that has been successfully treated with PUVA therapy. Materials & Methods: We have conducted a review of the literature published over the last 40 years on the treatment of histiocytosis with phototherapy in the online PubMed database. We also describe a new case of successful treatment of histiocytosis with PUVA therapy. Results: Our patient was a 27-year-old man with persistent outbreaks of cutaneous histiocytosis over the previous 8 years. He responded successfully to PUVA therapy, and no relapse has been detected after one year of follow-up. Discussion: Self-involution is usual in group C histiocytosis, so conservative management is usually the first approach. Relapsing cases pose a therapeutic challenge. Reported treatment options for these patients include isotretinoin, cryotherapy, immunosuppressants, low-dose chemotherapy, CO2 laser, radiotherapy, and surgery. Phototherapy and photochemotherapy have been used in a small number of patients with considerable success. The main limitation to provide firm recommendations on histiocytosis therapy is the absence of solid evidence, as the articles published are mainly case reports with a short follow-up. In our patient, despite the short follow-up we have considered photochemotherapy to be effective since no spontaneous remission had been achieved in the previous 8 years. Conclusion: PUVA therapy could be a safe and effective option to treat persistent cutaneous manifestations in patients with histiocytosis, although more evidence is required to support this statement. © 2022 John Wiley & Sons A/S.

In this research, we used this fish as a potential tool for the identification of EDCs that have a significant impact on human health. We conducted an electronic search in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) using the search terms, Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, and endocrine disruptions, and sorted 205 articles consisting of 128 chemicals that showed potential effects on estrogen–androgen–thyroid–steroidogenesis (EATS) pathways of Japanese medaka. From these chemicals, 14 compounds, namely, 17β-estradiol (E2), ethinylestradiol (EE2), tamoxifen (TAM), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), 17β-trenbolone (TRB), flutamide (FLU), vinclozolin (VIN), triiodothyronine (T3), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), terephthalic acid (TPA), trifloxystrobin (TRF), ketoconazole (KTC), and prochloraz (PCZ), were selected as references and used for the identification of apical endpoints within the EATS modalities. Among these endpoints, during classification, priorities are given to sex reversal (masculinization of females and feminization of males), gonad histology (testis–ova or ovotestis), secondary sex characteristics (anal fin papillae of males), plasma and liver vitellogenin (VTG) contents in males, swim bladder inflation during larval development, hepatic vitellogenin (vtg) and choriogenin (chg) genes in the liver of males, and several genes, including estrogen–androgen–thyroid receptors in the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad/thyroid axis (HPG/T). After reviewing 205 articles, we identified 108 (52.68%), 46 (22.43%), 19 (9.26%), 22 (17.18%), and 26 (12.68%) papers that represented studies on estrogen endocrine disruptors (EEDs), androgen endocrine disruptors (AEDs), thyroid endocrine disruptors (TEDs), and/or steroidogenesis modulators (MOS), respectively. Most importantly, among 128 EDCs, 32 (25%), 22 (17.18%), 15 (11.8%), and 14 (10.93%) chemicals were classified as EEDs, AEDs, TEDs, and MOS, respectively. We also identified 43 (33.59%) chemicals as high-priority candidates for tier 2 tests, and 13 chemicals (10.15%) show enough potential to be considered EDCs without any further tier-based studies. Although our literature search was unable to identify the EATS targets of 45 chemicals (35%) studied in 60 (29.26%) of the 205 articles, our approach has sufficient potential to further move the laboratory-based research data on Japanese medaka for applications in regulatory risk assessments in humans.

Blood and urine are traditionally used as human biomonitoring tools for internal exposure of environmental pollutants, while human hair, as an alternative matrix, has been seen as an attractive biomonitoring substrate because of the convenient and noninvasively collection, with minimal cost, and easy storage and transport for laboratory analysis. Also, hair sampling reflects fairly long-term exposure and may pinpoint the actual time of an acute exposure, as compared to routine biomonitoring tools. Owing to the advantages, an increasing number of studies have devoted to developing hair analysis in the past decades. However, concerns have still been raised regarding the appropriateness for assessing the internal dose by hair analysis so far. From two aspects of heavy metals and organic contaminants, this review summaries the research progress on analytical methodologies, exposure assessment, associations with internal/external indicators, distinction between endogenous and exogenous sources, health effects, and health-based reference values of environmental pollutants in human hair. It is indicated that cleaning is a key step in the methods of hair analysis. Pollutants in hair derived from both endogenous and exogenous contamination. Besides the incorporation in hair through the bloodstream (internal dose), pollutants may also be present in hair due to external exposure from air, dust, etc. Washing procedures for collected hair samples prior to analysis has been showed to be the most effective way to remove exogenous contamination, particularly for heavy metals. Organic solvent, surfactant, and deionized water are the most frequently used washing methods for hair analysis of organic pollutants; however, the applicability for the variety of organic pollutants is still questioned. Until now, extensive studies have reported the occurrence of environmental pollutants in human hair, but the lack of standard analytical methods makes it difficult for the information comparison. Another disadvantage is the limited evidence for the association between hair and body burden of pollutants. Although relevance between hair and environmental matrix, e.g., dust, air, and water have been indicated, inconsistent results were reported between hair and other internal indicators, e.g., blood, serum, and urine, except for arsenic (As) and selenium (Se), which have reached consensus for the correlations between hair and traditional indicators to some degree. Compared to heavy metals, relatively few studies have investigated the associations of organic pollutants between hair and endogenous tissues, which focused mainly on organohalogenated pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and other persistent organic pollutants. Besides the varied results on the significance of correlations between hair and blood, the correlation coefficients were generally low for most of the reported organic pollutants. These observations were commonly attributed to exogenous pollution, which highlight the importance of identifying internal and external sources of contaminants. In recent years, composition patterns, chiral signatures, and specific metabolites were successfully used to distinguish between the internal and external exposure sources of organic pollutants in hair. Nevertheless, the limitations of these methods implied that the internal and external sources of hair pollutants remain a controversial issue. Many studies, as yet, have assessed the health effects of heavy metals in hair, whereas the establishment of health-based reference values, except for As and mercury (Hg), is rather difficult since confounding factors impose restrictions on the interpretation of individual results. Meanwhile, no study, as far as we know, has investigated the health effects, nor yet reference values, of novel organic pollutants in human hair. The general consensus is that some scientific issues should be resolved before human hair can be accepted as a useful tool in evaluating internal exposure to environmental pollutants. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on hair analysis should focus on the elucidation of transport mechanisms of pollutants into hair and associations of pollutants between hair and blood/urine. It is necessary to undertake epidemiological studies based on hair analysis of organic pollutants as well as the formulation of health-based reference values. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Bioaccumulation and toxicity of pesticides have raised environmental concerns, highlighting the need for effective removal techniques by using nanomaterials. The ability of hybrid nitrogen incorporated bismuth oxide with stannous oxide (N-Bi2O3@SnO2) were utilized for the removal of Ethion (ET) and Toxaphene (TP) pesticides. Leaves of A. indica (commonly found plant in India) employed as a natural surfactant and deionised water as a greener solvent. The purity and crystallinity of the deformed spherical nanoparticle (10–80 nm) were ensured by the sharp peaks acquired by PXRD. Subsequently, N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite was investigated for the elimination of pesticides at discrete reaction parameters (pollutant: 2–10 mgL−1; catalyst: 15–35 mg; pH: 3–11, dark-sunlight). N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite showed maximum degradation (ET:96 % and TP:90 %) with 30 mg catalytic dosage, at initial concentration of pesticide (2 mgL−1) at neutral pH under sunlight irradiation. Larger surface area (75 m2g−1), more negative value of zeta potential (–23.4 mV), and lower bandgap (2.1 eV) supported the effective photocatalytic efficiency of N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite. The presence of holes, O2, and OH radicals were responsible for the breakdown of the complex structure of ET and TP, confirmed by scavenger analysis. Safer metabolites formed after degradation confirmed by GC–MS analysis. Conclusively, by virtues greater efficiency of reusability (n = 8), stability, and greater charge separation, hybrid N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite may prove as an alternative catalyst for industrial application with intense scope. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: M.

With the rising incidence of these injuries, they are expected to double by 2050. Incidence rates are higher in females than males and in white patients than black African patients. Osteoporosis weakens the local trochanteric anatomic support leading to an increased susceptibility to fractures. Disruption of the posteromedial calcar region results in fracture instability. Optimal lag screw position and fracture reduction are significant determinants for postoperative outcomes. The tip apex distance and reduction criteria determine lag screw cut-out risk and fracture reduction quality, respectively. A calcar-referenced tip apex distance is comparable if not better than the tip apex distance in predicting cut-out risk. Optimal reduction is in slight valgus, a positive medial cortex apposition and smooth anterior cortex apposition. High mortality rates are observed with non-surgical treatment. Surgical management is therefore the gold standard for intertrochanteric fractures. Treatment options are categorised into extramedullary fixation, intramedullary fixation and proximal femur replacement. They include the dynamic hip screw (DHS), cephalomedullary nails (CMN) and arthroplasty. Although still in use, the proximal femur locking plate is falling out of favour due to high complication rates. Fracture stability and pattern influence the treatment choice. There is, however, a growing use of CMNs which has been attributed to surgical training background. Modification of older CMN designs has improved treatment outcomes. Systematic meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) do not show superiority of one treatment option over another; therefore, there is no consensus on the best treatment choice. The proximal femur nail antirotation (PFNA) has better outcomes compared to other fixation options with respect to intraoperative blood loss and Harris hip scores. As a group, CMNs have a better 120-day postoperative quality of life compared to the DHS. No significant difference in complications has been found between treatment options. In light of the anticipated increased incidence of intertrochanteric fracture, more work is needed in planning national resource allocation, devising preventative methods and improving clinical interventions in South Africa. © 2023 Sukati FM.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: F.M.

Biomonitoring has been increasingly used to characterize exposure of firefighting forces to contaminants. However, available data are dispersed and information on the most relevant and promising biomarkers in this context of firefighting is missing. This review presents a comprehensive summary and critical appraisal of existing biomarkers of exposure including volatile organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, several other persistent other organic pollutants as well as heavy metals and metalloids detected in biological fluids of firefighters attending different fire scenarios. Urine was the most characterized matrix, followed by blood. Firefighters exhaled breath and saliva were poorly evaluated. Overall, biological levels of compounds were predominantly increased in firefighters after participation in firefighting activities. Biomonitoring studies combining different biomarkers of exposure and of effect are currently limited but exploratory findings are of high interest. However, biomonitoring still has some unresolved major limitations since reference or recommended values are not yet established for most biomarkers. In addition, half-lives values for most of the biomarkers have thus far not been defined, which significantly hampers the design of studies.

Methods: We searched 13 electronic databases and Google scholar, conducted citation searching and a review of reference lists to find studies which investigated the relationship of alcohol with clinical outcome of pesticide self-poisoning in different countries. Thirteen studies, including 11 case series/reports and two cohort studies were considered for inclusion. Results: Meta-analysis showed that alcohol co-ingestion in pesticide self-poisoning was associated with increased risk of death [odds ratio (OR) 4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-8.2 P<0.0001] and that alcohol co-ingested group required intubation eight times more often than non-co-ingested group in organophosphorus insecticide self-poisoning (OR 8.0, 95% CI 4.9-13.0 P<0.0001). Cases who co-ingested alcohol were older than non-alcohol group in two studies. One cohort study demonstrated that alcohol co-ingestion was associated with larger pesticide ingestions but did not itself affect the outcome.

A comparison of serially CCasp3 immunolabeled and H&E-stained sections revealed that mechanisms of hepatocellular death cannot be clearly discerned in H&E-stained liver sections alone as several examples of putatively necrotic cells were positive for CCasp3. Published whole genome transcriptomic data were also reevaluated for enrichment of various forms of hepatocellular death in response to HFPO-DA, which revealed enrichment of apoptosis and autophagy, but not ferroptosis, pyroptosis, or necroptosis. These morphological and molecular findings are consistent with transcriptomic evidence for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling in HFPO-DA exposed mice. © The Author(s) 2023.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: C.M.

Ever since perfluorooctane sulfonate and perfluorooctanoic acid were recognized by the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants, the public has become increasingly concerned about potential contamination and the environmental risks associated with PFASs. Ubiquitous PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and sediment has been detected, especially in areas with rapid industrial and economic development. Its accumulation in living organisms and foods has accentuated the importance of investigations into aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, as the stability and integrity of the food web as well as the population quantity and structure of the aquatic ecosystem may be affected. This review provides a comprehensive summary of the toxic and toxicity-related effects of PFASs on aquatic plankton, aquatic invertebrates and microorganisms, the characteristics of different target aquatic organisms in toxicity investigations, and a feasibility evaluation of PFAS substitutes to provide valuable suggestions for further utilization and regulation of PFASs and their substitutes. © 2022 by the authors.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: T.

This review aims to examine the prevalence of DDD amongst different populations. A systematic review protocol was developed before literature searching. Original articles were drawn from three electronic databases and included only studies where prevalence rates of DDD were assessed by standardized diagnostic tools. A narrative synthesis was conducted. Twenty-three papers were identified and categorized into three groups of participants: general population, mixed in/outpatient samples, and patients with specific disorders. The prevalence rates ranged from 0% to 1.9% amongst the general population, 5–20% in outpatients and 17.5–41.9% in inpatients. In studies of patients with specific disorders, prevalence rates varied: 1.8–5.9% (substance abuse), 3.3–20.2% (anxiety), 3.7–20.4% (other dissociative disorders), 16.3% (schizophrenia), 17% (borderline personality disorder), ~50% (depression). The highest rates were found in people who experienced interpersonal abuse (25–53.8%). The prevalence rate of DDD is around 1% in the general population, consistent with previous findings. DDD is more prevalent amongst adolescents and young adults as well as in patients with mental disorders. There is also a possible relationship between interpersonal abuse and DDD, which merits further research. © 2022 The Author(s).

Objective: This study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impacts of OP pesticides on semen quality and male reproductive hormones. Methods: This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocols. Strategic search was conducted using combined text words as search terms. The eligibility criteria were developed based on Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, and Study designs (PECOS) framework. Relevant data were extracted, risk of bias was evaluated by The Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) tool, and certainty of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group guidelines. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed by using Review Manager. Results: A total of 766 male subjects (349 exposed to OP pesticides and 417 unexposed controls) were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in the ejaculate volume, seminal fluid volume, sperm multiple anomaly index, sperm, and leukocytes levels of the OP-exposed subjects compared to the control. In addition, OP pesticides exposure did not significantly affect serum concentrations of FSH, LH, and testosterone in subjects who were exposed to OP pesticides compared to their unexposed counterparts. However, we found a significant reduction in the sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive sperm motility, total sperm motility, and normal sperm morphology of OP pesticides-exposed subjects compared to the unexposed subjects. However, after subtype and sensitivity analyses, exposure to OP pesticides did not reduce sperm count. Also, after sensitivity analysis, OP pesticides exposure did not alter progressive sperm motility. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that OP pesticides exposure reduced sperm count, concentration, total and progressive motility, and normal sperm morphology, possibly via a testosterone-independent mechanism.

However, there is currently a lack of clinical diagnostic methods for rapid metabolite detection in EB samples and metabolomic data processing. In this project, we develop a method that uses a collecting device to efficiently collect exhaled breath samples on perfluoroethylene propylene (FEP) modified silicon nanowires (SiNWs). The sample chips are directly detected by nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS), and the mass spectrometry (MS) results are collected as a dataset and analyzed by machine learning techniques. FEP@SiNWs chips improved metabolite trapping efficiency and laser desorption/ionization efficiency during sample collection and mass spectrometry detection, enabling rapid metabolomic analysis with good stability and detection repeatability. Through machine learning technology, the MS information of metabolites in EB samples of patients with pulmonary nodules and healthy people was processed, the characteristic peaks were selected, and the prediction accuracy (>95.4 %) and sensitivity (92.6 - 98.5 %) of the machine learning model were tested.

Many epidemiological studies have found that PFAS exposure is associated with hypertension risk, but others possess a different opinion. Overall, the relationship between PFASs and hypertension risk remains controversial. We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between PFAS exposure and human risk of hypertension. We conducted a meta-analysis based on population-involving studies published from 1975 to 2023, which we collected from Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases. The odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD), with their 95% confidence interval (CI), were used to assess the risk of hypertension with PFAS exposure. The statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the Q-test and I2 statistics. Research publications related to our meta-analysis topic were systematically reviewed. Fourteen studies involving 71,663 participants, in which 26,281 suffered hypertension, met the inclusion criteria. Our analyses suggest that exposure to general PFAS (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04-1.14) or PFOS (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05-1.30) is associated with hypertension risk. Specifically, elevated levels of general PFAS (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.08-0.42), PFHxS (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.07-0.27), and PFDA (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.02-0.13) are associated with a high risk of hypertension. Our meta-analysis indicates that PFAS exposure is a risk factor for hypertension, and increased hypertension risk is associated with higher PFAS levels. Further study may eventually provide a better and more comprehensive elucidation of the potential mechanism of this association. © 2023, International Heart Journal Association.

If they follow a similar course of action as other, more thoroughly investigated particulates, MNPs may penetrate epithelial barriers, potentially triggering a cascade of signaling events leading to cell damage and inflammation. Inflammasomes are intracellular multiprotein complexes and stimulus-induced sensors critical for mounting inflammatory responses upon recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns. Among these, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most studied in terms of activation via particulates. However, studies delineating the ability of MNPs to affect NLRP3 inflammasome activation are still rare. In this review, we address the issue of MNPs source and fate, highlight the main concepts of inflammasome activation via particulates, and explore recent advances in using inflammasome activation for assessment of MNP immunotoxicity. We also discuss the impact of co-exposure and MNP complex chemistry in potential inflammasome activation. Development of robust biological sensors is crucial in order to maximize global efforts to effectively address and mitigate risks that MNPs pose for human health.

The possible toxic effects of plastic particles are due to their potential toxicity, often combined with that of leachable additives and adsorbed contaminants. Conclusions: Unless the plastic value chain is transformed over the next two decades, the risks to species, marine ecosystems, climate, health, economy, and communities will be unmanageable. However, along with these risks are the unique opportunities to help transition to a more sustainable world. © 2023 Codon Publications.

These fish are extensively utilized in experimental studies to simulate carcinogenic, mutagenic, and general toxic effects. The literature search was conducted using Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and eLIBRARY.RU databases following the PRISMA 2020 recommendations. A total of 613 articles were identified, out of which 14 were selected for detailed analysis. Among them, 11 focused on assessing the impact of PCB exposure on the reproductive system of Danio rerio. Additionally, 8 articles reported on the results of studying the effects of parental exposure to PCBs on the viability and postembryonic development of their offspring. The adverse effects of PCBs, either alone or in combination with other POPs, have been studied to a lesser extent in male Danio rerio compared to females. Furthermore, the transmission of morphological and functional disorders to subsequent generations resulting from separate parental exposure to PCBs in both sexes, as well as the dose-response relationship, have not been adequately assessed based on the published works. Moreover, developmental disorders in offspring have mostly been studied for the first generation following parental exposure to mixtures of POPs and PCBs. The lack of such information hinders a proper evaluation of the transgenerational risk inheritance phenomenon, specifically regarding the transmission of morphological and functional disorders associated with progenitor exposure to PCBs and other environmental endocrine-disrupting pollutants. The findings of this analysis can be used for planning experimental quantitative assessments, predicting, and preventing impairments to human reproductive health, and safeguarding the well-being of future generations. © Eco-Vector, 2023.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: D.A.

Objective: Our purpose was to summarize the results of studies discussing the association between pesticides and male fertility. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was performed through MEDLINE via PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Only human studies were considered. Semen parameters and DNA integrity were considered to evaluate the effect of pesticides on men. Results: A total of 64 studies that investigated their impact in terms of semen parameters (51 studies) and chromatin and DNA integrity (25 studies) were included. The most frequently affected parameters were total sperm count, sperm motility, and sperm morphology, although a reduction in ejaculate volume and concentration occur in several cases. A tangible worsening of semen quality was associated with organochlorines and organophosphates. Furthermore, pesticide exposure, especially pyrethroids, was related to a higher DNA fragmentation index and chromosome aneuploidy in most articles. Conclusion: The epidemiological evidence supports the association between pesticides and male fertility for workers and the exposed population in terms of semen quality, DNA fragmentation, and chromosome aneuploidy. © 2022 The Authors.

Modification methods such as elemental doping, composite formation, and morphological modification have been highlighted. Using these modification methods, the catalytic activity of zinc ferrite toward the photocatalytic degradation of organic pollutants in water has been enhanced. Biosynthesis is regarded as a promising preparation method that uses biological materials instead of chemical materials to achieve the large-scale preparation of zinc ferrite using low cost, energy efficient, and environmentally friendly processes.

However, there are also local sources of pollution. Our study was focused on possible pollution in the Finnish Lapland, transferred from the Pechenganikel industrial complex located in the borders of Russia, Finland and Norway. Local food items and blood samples of pregnant women from the Inari municipality were collected and organochlorine compounds (OCs) and metal(oid)s analyzed. Most of the examined food samples showed detectable levels of these compounds. The mean concentrations of DDTs and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) were higher in fish (0.18–0.32 ng/g and 0.34–0.64 ng/g, respectively), than in the other food groups (0.027–0.047 ng/g and 0.11–0.20 ng/g, respectively). PCBs were found at the highest concentrations in blood samples of the pregnant women, and congeners 153 and 118 were dominant. The mean concentration of PCB153, 0.29 μg/kg serum lipid, was lower than those described in many other studies. Concerning DDTs, the 4,4′-DDT/4,4′-DDE ratio, 0.092, in the blood samples was lower than that observed in the food items, 0.25–0.71, reflecting old uses of the DDT pesticide. None of the observed levels of selected potentially toxic elements in blood samples and in food items exceeded the known safe limits. Higher concentrations of PCB52 and γ-HCH were observed in the serum of pregnant women who consumed greater amounts of meat, and berries and mushrooms, respectively. The OC concentrations from the pregnant women currently studied were lower than those observed fourteen years ago with pregnant women from the same municipality. Compounds whose occurrence is likely related to a long-distance transport showed clear decreases, e.g., 63% for PCBs, and for those from pesticides, decreases were 93% and 97% for 4,4′-DDE and β-HCH, respectively.

However, a growing body of literature has recognized that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may play an important role in this global trend, but the association has not yet been fully established. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: EDCs can interfere with normal hormone function and metabolism and play a role in pubertal onset. We aimed to systematically identify and evaluate the current evidence on the timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys following prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs. SEARCH METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in the PubMed database through a block search approach using a combination of index MeSH and free text search terms. Publications were considered if they covered biomarkers of prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs (European Commission's list of category 1 EDCs) measured in maternal or child biospecimen and pubertal onset defined by the progression of the following milestones (and assessed in terms of the following measures): menarche (age), thelarche (Tanner staging) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in girls, and genital stage (Tanner staging), testicular volume (ml) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in boys. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 703 references, of which we identified 52 publications fulfilling the eligibility criteria for the qualitative trend synthesis and 23 publications for the meta-analysis. The qualitative trend synthesis provided data on 103 combinations of associations between prenatal or postnatal exposure to EDC compounds groups and puberty outcomes and the meta-analysis enabled 18 summary risk estimates of meta-associations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Statistically significant associations in the qualitative trend synthesis suggested that postnatal exposure to phthalates may be associated with earlier thelarche and later pubarche. However, we did not find consistent evidence in the meta-analysis for associations between timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys and exposures to any of the studied xenobiotic EDCs. We were not able to identify specific pre- or postnatal windows of exposure as particularly critical and susceptible for effects of EDCs. Current evidence is subject to several methodological challenges and inconsistencies and evidence on specific exposure-outcome associations remains too scarce to firmly confirm EDC exposure as a risk factor for changes in age of pubertal onset in the general child population. To create a more uniform foundation for future comparison of evidence and to strengthen pooled studies, we recommend the use of more standardized approaches in the choice of statistical analyses, with exposure transformations, and in the definitions and assessments of puberty outcomes. The impact of mixtures of EDC exposures on the association also remains unestablished and would be valuable to elucidate for prenatal and postnatal windows of exposure. Future large, longitudinal epidemiological studies are needed to clarify the overall association.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the three products, namely {[Cu(phen)(L2)] ⋅ 1.25H2O} (1) (teal acicula, KPI = 60.6%), {[Cu(phen)(L2)]⋅ H2O⋅DMF}n(2) (sapphire blue plate, KPI = 65.6%) and {[Cu(phen)(L2)]⋅0.31H2O}n (3) (cool grey plate, KPI = 66.8%) are 1-D supramolecular Cu(II) coordination polymers. Both 1 and 2 are composed of 1-D zigzag chains with 1 contains heterochiral Cu(II) (Λ- and Δ- alternatively) centres in the same chain and 2 contains homochiral Cu(II) (Λ- or Δ-) centres in the same chain, while 3, containing homochiral Cu(II) (Λ- or Δ-) centres, has a helical structure along a axis, with a rectangular channel of a size 19.61 × 16.61 Å2. Each helical turn spans 10.74 Å, composed of two [Cu(L2)(Phen)] units. With the largest KPI (∼66.3%), the highest thermal stability, highest formation energy from DFT calculations and lowest hygroscopicity, 3 can be obtained as the only product at higher temperature (95°C) and/or higher ratio of water (DMF/water (v/v) = 20:6), which implies that it is the thermodynamic product. 2 can be obtained at mediate temperature (60 ∼ 80°C) as the only product or co-exist with other products, while 1 only appeared at low temperature (60 and 70 °C) in the solvents of DMF/water (v/v) = 20:2 or 20:3 at a very small amount. The chromotropism of the three isomers was examined using UV-Vis spectroscopic technique, and the coordination geometry of Cu(II) was examined with Hathaway's tetragonality analysis and Continuous Shape Measures Calculation using SHAPE 2.1 programme. Linear correlations between the solid-state UV-Vis absorption maxima of the three isomers against the tetragonality (T) or the distortion percentage of the coordination geometry of Cu(II) from a perfect octahedral (Doct) were observed. The three complexes were also analyzed by FT IR, TGA and DFT formation energy calculations. The thermodynamic stability and the thermal stability of the three isomer increases in order of 1 < 2 < 3, supported by the analysis of the metal-ligand coordination bonds and the intermolecular interactions, the study of chromotropism and crystal fields, the effects of solvent polarity and temperature to the formation of isomers, the close-packing theory (KPI calculations), the DFT calculations and the TGA analysis. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: R.

To compare the hepatotoxicity of H-PFMO2OSA with legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), male adult mice were exposed to 0.2, 1, or 5 mg/kg/d of each chemical for 28 days. Results showed that, although H-PFMO2OSA liver and serum concentrations were lower than those of PFOS, the relative liver weight in the H-PFMO2OSA groups was significantly higher than that in the corresponding PFOS groups. In addition, the increase in alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase activity was greater in the H-PFMO2OSA groups than in the PFOS groups. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione reductase activity in the liver increased in the 1 and 5 mg/kg/d H-PFMO2OSA groups and in the 5 mg/kg/d PFOS group. Liver quantitative proteome analysis demonstrated that, similar to PFOS, H-PFMO2OSA caused lipid metabolism disorder, and most lipid metabolism-related differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Additionally, KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted changes in the GSH metabolism pathway after PFOS and H-PFMO2OSA exposure. Then, there were eight DEPs involved in the GSH metabolism pathway that mostly were upregulated after exposure to H-PFMO2OSA but not after exposure to PFOS. In conclusion, H-PFMO2OSA induced higher levels of liver damage and more serious GSH metabolism dysregulation compared to PFOS. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

In this study, the sub-lethal toxicity effects of oxybenzone were studied at the environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.6 and 5.2 µg/L (including 0.01% DMSO as the solvent control). An integrative in vivo and in silico experimental approach was taken to study the effects of exposure on the metabolic physiology of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) after 7 days of exposure (from 2 to 9 days post fertilization). The use of whole-organism respirometry showed a statistically significant ∼2x increase in metabolic rate for the 0.6 µg/L treatment group, with no significant differences between the solvent control versus 5.2 µg/L oxybenzone treatment level. The analysis of whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing data showed functional categories related to metabolism (metabolic enzymes) and biological regulation (genome regulation, cell signaling) to be highly dysregulated. The transcriptomics changes for metabolic enzyme genes were used to parameterize in silico stoichiometric metabolic models for each treatment group. Flux balance analysis (FBA) simulations for each metabolic model revealed glycerolipid metabolism to be highly affected under the low dose oxybenzone exposure. The further analysis of core metabolic pathways revealed elevated flux through the esterification reactions of glycerolipid metabolism, producing triglycerides. The elevated in vivo metabolic rate observed for 0.6 µg/L oxybenzone is explainable by the elevated catalytic activities of the esterification reactions. Furthermore, the disruption of glycerolipid metabolism predicted by our in silico analysis agrees with the results of non-targeted metabolomics studies performed by other authors, and which demonstrate oxybenzone exposure to cause dyslipidemia and affect glycerophospholipid metabolism. Therefore, the methods of our study provide a framework for integrated biological pathways-based toxicological analysis. © 2022 The Author(s)","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: D.

In stress periods, however, proteostasis and survival depend on the strongly conserved Clp/Hsp100 family. Currently, the targets of ATP-powered unfoldases/disaggregases ClpB and ClpX and of peptidase ClpP heptameric rings are still unclear. Trapping experiments and proteome profiling in multiple organisms triggered confusion, so we analyzed the consistency of ClpP-trap targets in bacteria. We also provide meta-analyses of protein interactions in humans, to elucidate where Clp family members are enriched. Furthermore, meta-analyses of mouse complexomics are provided. Genotype–phenotype correlations confirmed our concept. Trapping, proteome, and complexome data retrieved consistent coaccumulation of CLPXP with GFM1 and TUFM orthologs. CLPX shows broad interaction selectivity encompassing mitochondrial translation elongation, RNA granules, and nucleoids. CLPB preferentially attaches to mitochondrial RNA granules and translation initiation components; CLPP is enriched with them all and associates with release/recycling factors. Mutations in CLPP cause Perrault syndrome, with phenotypes similar to defects in mtDNA/mtRNA. Thus, we propose that CLPB and CLPXP are crucial to counteract misfolded insoluble protein assemblies that contain nucleotides.

Indeed, LC is relatively easy to couple with the soft electrospray ionization. As a consequence, many tools have been developed for the structural annotation of tandem mass spectra. However, it is sometimes difficult to do data-dependent acquisition (DDA), especially when developing new methods that stray from the classical LC-MS workflow. Objective: An old tool from petroleomics that has recently gained popularity in metabolomics, the Van Krevelen diagram, is adapted for an overview of the molecular diversity profile in lichens through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Methods: A new method is benchmarked against the state-of-the-art classification tool ClassyFire using a database containing most known lichen metabolites (n ≈ 2,000). Four lichens known for their contrasted chemical composition were selected, and extractions with apolar, aprotic polar, and protic polar solvents were performed to cover a wide range of polarities. Extracts were analyzed with direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DI-ESI-MS) and atmospheric solids analysis probe mass spectrometry (ASAP-MS) techniques to be compared with the chemical composition described in the literature. Results: The most common lichen metabolites were efficiently classified, with more than 90% of the molecules in some classes being matched with ClassyFire. Results from this method are consistent with the various extraction protocols in the present case study. Conclusion: This approach is a rapid and efficient tool to gain structural insight regarding lichen metabolites analyzed by HRMS without relying on DDA by LC-MS/MS analysis. It may notably be of use during the development phase of novel MS-based metabolomic approaches. © 2022 The Authors.

Dioxin and Dioxin-related compounds are a set of hazardous chemicals that are ubiquitously distributed. Polychlorinated dioxins are introduced into our surroundings by both spontaneous and induced activities like combustion, incineration of waste, recycling of e-waste, and paper and pesticide manufacturing. They are chloroaromatic compounds that are found to be lethal and possess carcinogenic properties and are one of the primary examples of persistent environmental pollutants (POP). Removal of these compounds from the environment is very challenging due to their recalcitrant nature. An alternative technique is the use of microbial technology which includes the use of bacteria and fungi to detoxify the dioxins that are considered to be a more effective, economical, and environmentally sustainable alternative. Different microbial interactions were studied for their degradation potential. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and furans (PCDD/F) are found to be degraded by bacteria by adopting either aerobic or anaerobic pathways and the details regarding the diversity, distribution, bioremediation potential, metabolic pathway have been analyzed. This review provides an overview of the source of contamination, its potential toxicity assessment, and various bioremediation techniques that are employed are discussed in detail.

Design A systematic search was conducted in four databases and the grey literature. The risk of bias of the studies was analyzed with the aid of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A quantitative synthesis was performed through meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each result using the Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: Thirteen studies (seven cross-sectional, two cohort and four case-control studies) were included in the qualitative analysis and eleven were included in the meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were conducted considering general DDE (regardless of the type of defect), hypoplasia, molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) and hypomineralized primary second molars (HPSM). Subgroups based on the type of dentition were also analyzed. Children of mothers who had GDM presented a greater likelihood of general DDE (OR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.66–4.44), MIH (OR = 3.14; 95% CI: 1.20–8.25) and hypoplasia (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.36–3.46). No association was found between HPSM and GDM (OR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.17–2.20). An association was found between GDM and DDE in the permanent dentition.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were con-sidered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for “legacy” PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SEM highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The previously isolated phenanthrene-degrading bacterial consortium (PDMC) consists of the genera Sphingobium and Pseudomonas and can degrade a wide range of PAHs. To identify the degradation mechanism of PAHs in the consortium PDMC, metagenomic binning was conducted and a Sphingomonadales assembly genome with 100% completeness was obtained. Additionally, Sphingobium sp. SHPJ-2, an efficient degrader of PAHs, was successfully isolated from the consortium PDMC. Strain SHPJ-2 has powerful degrading abilities and various degradation pathways of high-molecular-weight PAHs, including fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, and chrysene. Two ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases, five cytochrome P450s, and a pair of electron transfer chains associated with PAH degradation in strain SHPJ-2, which share 83.0%–99.0% similarity with their corresponding homologous proteins, were identified by a combination of Sphingomonadales assembly genome annotation, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and heterologous expression. Furthermore, when coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with the appropriate electron transfer chain, PhnA1B1 could effectively degrade chrysene and benzo[a]anthracene, while PhnA2B2 degrade fluoranthene. Altogether, these results provide a comprehensive assessment of strain SHPJ-2 and contribute to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism responsible for the PAH degradation. © 2022 The Authors. mLife published by John Wiley & Sons Australia, Ltd. on behalf of Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: H.

These release a mix of potentially hazardous chemicals, which is an important public health concern. These chemicals include polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), used as flame retardants in electronic parts, which are persistent in nature and show bioaccumulative characteristics. Although PBDEs are suspected endocrine disruptors, particularly targeting thyroid and reproductive hormone functions, the relationship of PBDEs with these health effects are not well established. We used the Navigation Guide methodology to conduct a systematic review of studies in populations exposed to e-waste to better understand the relationships of these persistent flame retardants with hormonal and reproductive health. We assessed nineteen studies that fit our pre-determined inclusion criteria for risk of bias, indirectness, inconsistency, imprecision, and other criteria that helped rate the overall evidence for its quality and strength of evidence. The studies suggest PBDEs may have an adverse effect on thyroid hormones, reproductive hormones, semen quality, and neonatal health.

Objectives: Cervical spine endoscopic discectomy and decompression have gained popularity in the last decade. This review aimed to shed light on the current outcomes of cervical spine endoscopic procedures for degenerative disc disease (DDD) and to calculate a pooled estimate of various outcome measures. Methods: We retrieved articles published in English related to endoscopic cervical spine procedures from 3 central databases from inception until September 2020. A subgroup analysis based on the anterior versus the posterior approach was performed. Results: Thirty-one articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria and included 1,410 patients. A successful outcome was observed in 91.3% (88.6-93.4%, P = 0.000). This percentage was lower for the anterior approach (89.6% [85.8-92.5%], P = 0.000) than for the posterior approach (94.2% [90.4-96.5%], P = 0.000). A higher percentage of poor outcomes was reported for the anterior approach (5.7% [3.2-10.1%], P = 0.000 vs. 2.3% [1-5.5%], P = 0.000 for the posterior approach). The overall complication rate was 7.2% (5.2-9.8%, P = 0.000). There was a slightly higher complication rate for the anterior approach (7.9% [4.5-13.3%], P = 0.000) than for the posterior approach (6.7% [4.4-10%], P = 0.000). The revision rate was 4.2% (2.6-6.8%, P = 0.000); and 4.2% (1.8-9.7%, P = 0.000) for the anterior approach and 4.00% (2.2-7.4%, P = 0.000) for the posterior approach. Conclusions: There is a higher success rate and lower complication rate with the posterior approach than with the anterior approach.

The toxicological data may help in understanding the mechanism of death. This systematic review aimed to analyze autopsies related to suicides by consuming poison, focusing on the correlation between substance use and the country of origin to create an alarm bell to indicate that suicide maybe attempted and prevent it. The systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, with the primary objective of identifying autopsies conducted in cases of suicide by consuming poison in specific geographic areas. Significant differences in substances were observed between low-income and Western countries that confirm previous literature data. In rural areas and Asian countries, most suicides by consuming poison involve the use of pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates. In Western countries, illicit drugs and medically prescribed drugs are the leading cause of suicide by self-poisoning. Future research should shed light on the correlation between social, medical, and demographic characteristics and the autopsy findings in suicides by self-poisoning to highlight the risk factors and implement tailored prevention programs worldwide. Performing a complete autopsy on a suspected suicide by self-poisoning could be essential in supporting worldwide public health measures and policy makers.

Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of two large studies of PFOA and renal cell carcinoma (RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer); one from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (324 cases and controls), and a second from the C8 Science Panel (103 cases and 511 controls). Serum PFOA levels were estimated a median of 8 years before diagnosis. Analyses were conducted via conditional logistic regression. Lifetime risk of kidney cancer per unit serum PFOA concentration and per unit dose were calculated. Results: The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of serum PFOA levels were 4.8, 7.3, and 23.9 ng/ml for the pooled analysis. The preferred model for the pooled data was a two-piece linear spline model (knot at 12.5 ng/ml serum PFOA); the log odds of RCC increased 0.1349 per 1 ng/ml increase in serum PFOA up to the knot (eg, an OR of 2.02 (1.45–2.80) from the median to the knot), and was flat thereafter. The estimated lifetime excess risk (cancer slope factor) with an exposure of 1 ng/ml was 0.0018, similar to the excess risk of 0.0026 recently reported by CalEPA based on different methods. Assuming a serum half-life of 2.3 years and a distribution volume of 170 ml/kg for PFOA, our results are equivalent to 0.0128 per ng/kg/d of PFOA intake. To limit excess lifetime kidney cancer risk to 1/1,000,000, our data suggest a limit of 0.0015 ng/L (0.0015 ppt) for PFOA in drinking water, similar to CalEPA's proposed Public Health Goal and the new US EPA Drinking Water Health Advisory.

Global warming can alter also the distribution of persistent organic pollutant (POPs) both at a global scale and in the Antarctic Region, due to their physical-chemical characteristics. Effects of climate changes have been already reported on feeding behaviour and reproductive process of organisms. Another consequence for organisms includes the POP bioaccumulation. Here we review the literature reporting the linkage between recorded effects of climate changes and POP bioaccumulation in resident marine Antarctic species (fish and penguins). Notwithstanding Antarctica is a final sink for persistent contaminants due to the extreme cold climate, a general decreasing POP trend has been observed for some POPs. Their concentrations in biota are reported to be linked to ice melting and large iceberg calving; the peculiar marine Antarctic ecosystems and the pelagic-benthic coupling may also contribute to alterations in the bioaccumulation processes. These effects are similar in polar regions, although the comparison with the Arctic biota is not possible due to the lack of data in the Antarctic Region. It remains an open question if the POP amount accumulated in the Antarctic ecosystems is decreasing or not. © 2022 The Royal Society of Chemistry.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: S.

In African countries like Nigeria, the evidence to inform plastic pollution management is scanty. This rapid review aimed to systematically evaluate evidence on the distribution, sources, biological effects, research gaps and policy needs of plastic pollution in various environmental matrices in Nigeria. Peer-reviewed journal articles on nano-, micro-, meso- and macroplastics contamination of water, sediment, air, soil and biota were accessed from PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct. They were screened, comprehensively revised and critically appraised for inclusion, data extraction and evidence synthesis. A total of 358,974 articles were accessed from any publication date up till May 30, 2021. Only 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and critical appraisal. Only 26 of the included studies reported the distribution, levels and/or effects of microplastics (MPs) (n = 12), macroplastics (n = 12) or both (n = 2) in water, sediment, biota, food and/or land. Only 15 of the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory had any data on micro- and/or macroplastics. Macroplastics from land-based sources were mainly reported from educational institutions, residential areas and markets. Plastic sources reported were tire wear, cigarette butts, fishing ropes and gears, plastic bags, water sachets and e-wastes. Biological effects (oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reduced plant root biomass) of virgin MPs were reported in crab, African catfish and lime tree only in laboratory experiments. Microplastic data in biota were limited to selected fish species, aquatic insects and gastropods. Only one (1) study on plastics in waterbodies in Northern Nigeria (Kogi State) was found. Research gaps on plastic distribution in terrestrial biota, other aquatic biota, soil, air, ground and potable water sources as well as biological effects were identified.

Over 1400 research articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of this test. Methods: The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects—mainly from a patient-perspective. Results: A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? Conclusions: Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: T.

This systematic review aims to determine the extent of this emerging problem, both quantitatively and qualitatively, combining temporal and science mapping analyses to explore the development of the field of UV-filters in the marine environment (from 1990 to 2021), and to outline new research frontiers. The temporal trend analysis revealed an exponential growth of published studies over the last decade (70% since 2016), confirming the emerging role of this topic in environmental science. The meta-analysis determined that 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) are top-priority environmental pollutants due to their increasing usage and, in turn, a frequent occurrence in marine ecosystems. This meta-analysis determined the focus on these two contaminants for this review. A critical discussion of the applications, regulatory aspects, and environmental occurrences of these selected compounds was provided. The present study also focused on the most recent (2015–2021) field and laboratory studies investigating the ecotoxicological impacts of 4-MBC and BP-3 on marine invertebrates. This review highlights the need for more research efforts to fill the knowledge gaps on the realistic effects these compounds may have when considered individually, in combination, or as subsequent exposures.

PFAS are stable and extremely resistant to degradation, resulting in high persistence throughout the environment as well as in human blood. PFAS consist of a large family of synthetic chemicals, with over 4000 distinct varieties having been identified and around 250 currently being manufactured at globally relevant levels. Numerous epidemiological studies have linked exposure to PFAS with adverse health effects ranging from immunotoxicity, cardiometabolic disease, developmental and reproductive effects, cancer, and recently type 2 diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated associations between serum PFAS concentrations and glycemic indicators of type 2 diabetes including glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR in adolescent and adult cohorts. In addition, some studies have shown positive associations with incident type 2 diabetes and multiple PFAS. However, the link between PFAS exposure and the development of diabetes continues to be a disputed area of study, with conflicting data having been reported from various epidemiological studies. In this mini review we will summarize the current state of the literature linking PFAS to type 2 diabetes and discuss important future directions including the use of more complex mixtures-based statistical analyses.

J Patient Rep Outcomes 5 (Suppl 2):99, 2021) such as the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The Australasian Pelvic Floor Procedure Registry (APFPR) aims to increase capacity for women to report surgical outcomes through the collection of HrQoL data (Ruseckaite et al. Qual Life Res. 2021) but currently lacks a pain-specific PROM for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), particularly POP and SUI. This review aims to systematically review the existing literature and identify instruments that measure pain in women with POP and SUI for inclusion within the APFPR, which reports on complications from these conditions. Methods: We conducted a literature search on OVID MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMCARE databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies from inception to April 2021. Full-text studies were included if they used PROMs to measure pain in women with POP and SUI. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Results: From 2001 studies, 23 publications describing 19 different PROMs were included for analysis. Eight of these instruments were specific to the pelvic floor; four were only specific to pain and used across multiple disorders; three were generic quality of life instruments and four were other non-validated instruments such as focus group interviews. These instruments were not specific to pain in women with POP or SUI, as they did not identify all relevant domains such as the sensation, region and duration of pain, or incidents where onset of pain occurs. Conclusions: The findings of this review suggest there are no current PROMs that are suitable pain-specific instruments for women with POP or SUI.

Data for >35 PFAS were aggregated from 96 reports published from 1999 to 2021. The final data set comprises approximately 21,000 data points after removal of time-series and duplicate samples as well as non-detects. The reported concentrations range over many orders of magnitude, from ng/L to mg/L levels. Distinct differences in concentration ranges are observed between sites located within or near sources versus those that are not. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranging from <0.03 ng/L to ~7 mg/L, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), ranging from 0.01 ng/L to ~5 mg/L, were the two most reported PFAS. The highest PFAS concentration in groundwater is ~15 mg/L reported for the replacement-PFAS 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). Maximum reported groundwater concentrations for PFOA and PFOS were compared to concentrations reported for soils, surface waters, marine waters, and precipitation. Soil concentrations are generally significantly higher than those reported for the other media. This accrues to soil being the primary entry point for PFAS release into the environment for many sites, as well as the generally significantly greater retention capacity of soil compared to the other media. The presence of PFAS has been reported for all media in all regions tested, including areas that are far removed from specific PFAS sources. This gives rise to the existence of a “background” concentration of PFAS that must be accounted for in both regional and site-specific risk assessments. The presence of this background is a reflection of the large-scale use of PFAS, their general recalcitrance, and the action of long-range transport processes that distribute PFAS across regional and global scales. This ubiquitous distribution has the potential to significantly impact the quality and availability of water resources in many regions. In addition, the pervasive presence of PFAS in the environment engenders concerns for impacts to ecosystem and human health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 32; Correspondence Address: G.R.

This article provides an updated overview of ClO2-based oxidation processes used in water treatment. A systematic review of scientific information and experimental data on ClO2-based water purification procedures is presented. Concerning ClO2-based oxidation derivative problems, the pros and cons of ClO2-based combined processes are assessed and disinfection by-product (DBP) control approaches are proposed. The kinetic and mechanistic data on ClO2 reactivity towards micropollutants are discussed. ClO2 selectively reacts with electron-rich moieties (anilines, phenols, olefins, and amines) and eliminates certain inorganic ions and microorganisms with high efficiency. The formation of chlorite and chlorate during the oxidation process is a crucial concern when utilizing ClO2. Future applications include the combination of ClO2 with ferrous ions, activated carbon, ozone, UV, visible light, or persulfate processes. The combined process can reduce by-product generation while still ensuring ClO2 sterilization and disinfection. Overall, this research could provide useful information and new insights into the application of ClO2-based technologies. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 22; Correspondence Address: B.

Among the different biological matrices used for exposure assessment, hair enables to detect the largest number of chemicals, including many classes such as persistent pollutants, hydrophilic metabolites and metals. Most biomonitoring studies are however focused on a limited number of pollutants and only give a partial information on exposure. Combining several multi-residue methods, the present study aimed at assessing the exposure of a population to an extensive variety of chemicals by hair analysis. One hair sample was collected from each participant (55 children and 134 adults). Samples were analysed with three different multi-residue methods, targeting, respectively, 152 organic pollutants (pesticides, PCBs, bisphenols, PBDEs), 62 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metabolites, nicotine and cotinine and 36 metals. From 33 to 70 organic chemicals were detected in each child’s hair sample, and from 34 up to 74 in adults. From 7 to 26 PAH were detected per child, and 7 to 21 in adults. Twenty-three to 27 metals were detected per child and 21 to 28 per adult. The highest median concentration were observed for zinc (143 μg /mg in children; 164 μg /mg in adults), bisphenol A (95.9 pg/mg in children; 64.7 pg/mg in adults) and nicotine (66.4 pg/mg in children; 51.9 pg/mg in adults). The present study provides the most comprehensive exposure assessment ever and highlights the simultaneous exposure to multiple classes of pollutants in the general population. The results support the use of multi-residue methods for future studies on exposure-associated effects, to document exposome and better consider the effect of chemical mixtures. © 2021, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: A.

Additionally, the unique physicochemical properties of single atom sites endow SACs with superior activity in various catalytic processes for environmental remediation (ER). Generally, SACs are burgeoning and promising materials in the application of ER. However, a systematic and critical review on the mechanism and broad application of SACs-based ER is lacking.

The most currently used dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the proximal femoral nail (PFN) are both with pros and cons. We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of these interventions for trochanteric fractures by evaluating the surgical performance and postoperative outcomes. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register were searched for RCTs comparing DHS and PFN for trochanteric fractures. All selected studies and the risk of bias were assessed. Clinical data including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, successful closed reduction and complications like nonunion, implant failure and reoperation were recorded. Random-effects models were used in Review Manager software, and GRADE was applied for the interpretation of the evidence. Results: From 286 identified trials, twelve RCTs including 1889 patients were eligible for inclusion; six RCTs directly comparing DHS with PFN, while other six compared DHS with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). Compared to DHS, PFN had shorter operative time and led to less intraoperative blood loss. However, DHS need less intraoperative fluoroscopy time than PFN. No difference was seen for the achievement of closed reduction. For risk of postoperative complications, no difference was seen between PFN and DHS for non-union, risk of implant failure and revision surgery. Conclusions: PFN(A) resulted in a shorter operative time and less intraoperative blood loss compared to DHS. However, no difference was seen for postoperative complications.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) is a novel technique that allows BD by echoendoscopy and fluoroscopy using a stent from the biliary tree to the gastrointestinal tract. AIM To compare the technical aspects and outcomes of percutaneous transhepatic BD (PTBD) and EUS-BD. METHODS Different databases, including PubMed, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, the Cochrane library, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched according to the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses to obtain studies comparing PTBD and EUS-BD. RESULTS Among the six studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, PTBD patients underwent significantly more reinterventions (4.9 vs 1.3), experienced more postprocedural pain (4.1 vs 1.9), and experienced more late adverse events (53.8% vs 6.6%) than EUS-BD patients. There was a significant reduction in the total bilirubin levels in both the groups (16.4-3.3 μmol/L and 17.2-3.8 μmol/L for EUSBD and PTBD, respectively; P = 0.002) at the 7-d follow-up. There were no significant differences observed in the complication rates between PTBD and EUSBD (3.3 vs 3.8). PTBD was associated with a higher adverse event rate than EUSBD in all the procedures, including reinterventions (80.4% vs 15.7%, respectively) and a higher index procedure (39.2% vs 18.2%, respectively). CONCLUSION The findings of this systematic review revealed that EUS-BD is linked with a higher rate of effective BD and a more manageable procedure-related adverse event profile than PTBD. These findings highlight the evidence for successful EUS-BD implementation.  © The Author(s) 2022.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: E.

Humic acid (HA), the main component of soil organic matter, or more specifically, the quinone moieties in HA, is generally regarded as an “electron shuttle” between pollutants and microorganisms, which could promote microbial remediation of contamination. In this study, we examined the dechlorination of PCB153 by adding HA and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS, a model compound of quinones) to systems containing PCB dechlorinators, analyzed the composition and functional gene network of the microbial community by metagenomics, and explored the role of HA by modifying or substituting carbon sources or electron donors. However, this study found that HA accelerated microbial dechlorination of PCBS, while AQDS did not. Moreover, HA without quinone activity still promoted dechlorination, but not without carbon source or electron donor. Metagenomic analysis showed that HA did not promote the growth of PCB dechlorinator (Dehalococcoides), but the transmembrane electron carriers in the HA group were higher than those in the AQDS group and the control group, so HA may have promoted the electron transport process. This study is helpful for microbial remediation of PCB contamination, and provides new insights into the role that HA plays in the biogeochemical cycle. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.

Methods: Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case–control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests. Results: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00-–1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15–1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03–1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02–1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91–1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00–1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02–1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00–1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis. Conclusion: These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.

This systematic review provides an overview of studies on pesticide residues during the last decade and the related human health risk assessment. Thirty-five original articles published since 2010 reporting the levels of pesticide residues in raw cow's milk in 69 regions from 15 countries were reviewed. Data showed that pesticide residue levels were ranked as, DDTs> permethrin> bifenthrin> Drins> endrin> endosulfan> HCHs> cyhalothrin> cypermethrin> heptachlor> ethion> coumaphos> deltamethrin> dimethoate, chlorpyriphos> profenofos> malathion> dichlorvos> parathion methyl> carbaryl> aldicarb> carbofuran> methamidophos. High geographic variation was observed, and many regions appear as contaminated zones with high risks such as Punjab in Pakistan (× 3080 > MRL and × 113 > MRL for Cypermethrin and Drins, respectively), Sand Pedro in Columbia (× 1090 > MRL and × 200 > MRL for endrin and Drins, respectively), and Gezira State in Sudan (× 109 > MRL DDTs). The risk assessment for humans indicated that HQ Drins values were > 1 in Columbia (Sucre, Casa Azul, San Pedro, Costanera, Sabanas, Sinú Medio, and San Jorge regions), and in Pakistan (Punjab region). Moreover, the HQ values for endrin were > 1 in Sinú Medio (Colombia) and for heptachlor in Costanera region, Sinú Medio, and Sabanas (Colombia). Furthermore, HI values were > 1 in seven regions in Colombia, 1 region in Pakistan, 1 region in Egypt and 1 region in Turkey, suggesting a serious health risk.

The results showed that MPs have reached different zones of the ocean and are more frequently reported in the Northern Hemisphere, where higher concentrations are found. MPs are also concentrated in depths up to 3000 m, where they are also more frequently studied, but also extend deeper than 10,000 m. Potentially toxic metals (PTMs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), organotins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified as the most prevalent and widely distributed MPs at ≥200 m depth. PTMs are widely distributed in the deep sea in high concentrations; aluminum is the most prevalent up to 3000 m depth, followed by zinc and copper. PCBs, organotins, hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs), PAHs, and phenols were detected accumulated in both organisms and environmental samples above legislated thresholds or known toxicity levels. Our assessment indicated that the deep sea can be considered a sink for MPs. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: R.S.

Although the volume of literature has shown an annual growth trend, there is no literature available for bibliometric and clinical analysis of the content of multiple databases in this field. Methods: The articles were obtained from the WOSCC, Scopus, Pubmed, and ClinicalTrials on 27 December 2021. Three scientometric software (VOSviewer 1.6.17, CiteSpace 5.8.R.1 and Scimago Graphica) were used to perform bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis. Results: We included 867 articles from WOSCC, 716 articles from Scopus and 6 clinical studies from ClinicalTrials for literature analysis. Our results showed that China was the country with the highest number of publications, with the United States (US) being the leader in terms of international collaborations and the number of citations. Sakai D, Grad S and Hoyland JA had made outstanding contributions for their high productivity and the quality articles. Spine was the most published and most cited journal, in addition to Spine Journal and Biomaterials, which were also more authoritative journals and had received high citations. All of them had received high citations. Keyword co-occurrence studies suggested that the current hotspots were in mechanistic studies, including inflammation, apoptosis, exosome, autophagy, and others. Some studies had also investigated tissue-engineered scaffolds of SCs to better repair degenerated discs. Clinical studies were relatively scarce. Direct injection of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) into degenerated discs for the treatment of Degenerative disc disease (DDD) was the current direction of research. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the global research hotspots, trends and clinical use of SCs in the treatment of IDD. It can help scholars to quickly understand the current status and hotspots of research in this field, and also provide some guidance and reference for those who are currently researching in this area.

HFPO-TA is reported to have high capability of bioaccumulation, widespread environmental distribution, and multiple toxicities. However, its potential toxicity on the intestines and gut microbiota remains unknown. In the present study, male mice were orally exposed to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA for 6 weeks, and after total genomic DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing was performed. Our results demonstrated that HFPO-TA exposure resulted in the imbalance of cecal microbiota and alterations of cecal microbiota diversity. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Deferribacteres, and Tenericutes increased in mice after exposure to HFPO-TA, while the relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, and TM7 decreased. At the genus level, the relative abundances of Ver Akkermansia, Pre Prevotella, Lac Coprococcus, Por_Parabacteroides, and Lac Dorea decreased in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Meanwhile, the increased relative abundances of Def_Mucispirillum, Des_Desulfovibrio and Odo Odoribacter were observed in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Additionally, KEGG metabolic pathway analysis revealed that HFPO-TA exposure changed the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism, galactose metabolism pathway and other metabolic pathways. Collectively, all these findings indicate the potential gut toxicity of HFPO-TA and is perceived as a risk of health on gut microbiota.

Clearly, temperature and insecticide exposure cause changes in the underlying metabolism, and the NMR metabolomic profile enables a direct examination of the immediate response of the vector to cope up with these changes. The present study was designed in four parts: A-Aedes aegypti were exposed to 40 °C for one-hour, DDT-4%, malathion-5%, and deltamethrin-0.05% separately and, part B-D; one-hour exposure at 35 °C and 40 °C temperatures followed by one-hour exposure to insecticide. The resultant metabolite profiles were compared with the control. In response to temperature and insecticide exposure, several metabolites and altered pathways were identified. Citrate, maltose, lipids, Nicotinate, Choline, Pyruvate and β-hydroxybutyrate were found as important components of major biological pathways such as tri-carboxylic acid cycle, branched amino acid degradation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide PRPP pathway, and phospholipid metabolism. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the changes imposed by exposure to temperature and insecticides individually, are reversed with combined exposure, thus negating the impact of each other and posing a threat to the control of Aedes-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: R.C.

In this study, we demonstrated that oral PFOS exposure (1 μg/g BW and 5 μg/g BW) decreased the function of the Luteinizing hormone (LH)/Luteinizing hormone receptor (LHr) and decreased epididymal sperm motility. Consistently, testicular transcriptome analysis revealed that PFOS altered the expression of a cluster of genes associated with sperm motility and steroidogenesis. In mice exposed to PFOS, c-Fos immunostaining showed activation of the lateral septal nucleus (LS), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), locus coeruleus (LC), which are known to be related to anxiety-like behaviors. Metabolomic analyses of the hypothalamus revealed that exposure to PFOS perturbed the translation of proteins, as well as the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants with the characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation. PFAS exposure can affect the function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological studies investigating potential relationships between PFAS exposure and vaccine antibody levels, and assessed whether PFAS would affect vaccine response in healthy children. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few studies are available.

Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from date of inception to June 2022. Studies were selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Simultaneously, a retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent neurosurgical evaluation of suspected PEPA at our institution. Results: Of the 321 articles in the original literature search, 62 were selected. A total of 143 patients (93 men, 27 women; mean age, 70.7 years) diagnosed with PEPA were included. Mean time from carotid endarterectomy to PA diagnosis was 41.8 months. Primary repair data were available for 135 patients, including 19 with primary closures, 112 with patch or graft repairs, and 4 with eversion procedures. Fifty-five patients with PA (39%) presented with infection. Staphylococcal species were the most common causative organism. Of infected PAs, 89.1% were treated with open procedures. Overall complication rates of PAs treated via open, endovascular, and hybrid methods were 31%, 15.4%, and 0%, respectively. Open ligation (42.9%) and aneurysmectomy with grafting (36.4%) resulted in the highest rates of complications. Conclusions: Despite higher complication rates after open repair strategies, use of these techniques remains a viable option in situations requiring removal of infected patches or evacuation of large extravascular collections. Endovascular treatment options are associated with low numbers of complications and can be considered for primary PEPA treatment when infection is not present. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: C.

Surgical treatment is the optimal strategy for managing intertrochanteric fractures as it allows early rehabilitation and functional recovery. The relative effects of internal fixation strategies for intertrochanteric fracture after operation remain limited to relatively small studies which create uncertainty in attempts to establish evidence-based best practice. Methods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and observational studies to assess the clinical effectiveness of two commonly used intramedullary devices: a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) versus a single-screw cephalomedullary nail (proximal femoral nail antirotation) in patients with intertrochanteric fractures. The following outcomes were considered: revisions, implant-related failures, non-unions, pain, Harris hip score and intra-operative outcomes. Odds ratios or mean differences with 95% confidence intervals in brackets are reported. Results: Six studies met the inclusion criteria: two randomised controlled trials and four observational studies enrolling 970 patients with a mean age of 77 years and 64% of patients being female. There was a statistically significant difference (p value < 0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13–0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09–0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34–0.74). There was no difference in non-unions and Harris hip score (p value > 0.05). There was a significant difference in blood loss and fluoroscopy usage in favour of PFNA, while no difference in operating times was observed between the two devices. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) is clinically more effective when compared to a single-screw cephalomedullary nail proximal femoral nail antirotation resulting in fewer complications, fewer revisions and fewer patients complaining of pain. No difference has been established regarding non-unions and Harris hip score. Intra-operative outcomes favour PFNA with less blood loss and fluoroscopy usage.

At present, leishmaniasis treatment mainly counts on chemotherapy. The currently available drugs against leishmaniasis are costly, toxic, with multiple side effects, and limitations in the administration route. The rapid emergence of drug resistance has severely reduced the potency of anti-leishmanial drugs. As a result, there is a pressing need for the development of novel anti-leishmanial drugs with high potency, low cost, acceptable toxicity, and good pharmacokinetics features. Due to the availability of preclinical data, drug repurposing is a valuable approach for speeding up the development of effective anti-leishmanial through pointing to new drug targets in less time, having low costs and risk. Metabolic pathways of this parasite play a crucial role in the growth and proliferation of Leishmania species during the various stages of their life cycle. Based on available genomics/proteomics information, known pathways-based (sterol biosynthetic pathway, purine salvage pathway, glycolysis, GPI biosynthesis, hypusine, polyamine biosynthesis) Leishmania-specific proteins could be targeted with known drugs that were used in other diseases, resulting in finding new promising anti-leishmanial therapeutics. The present review discusses various metabolic pathways of the Leishmania parasite and some drug candidates targeting these pathways effectively that could be potent drugs against leishmaniasis in the future. © 2022 by the authors.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: P.

We employed a combination of traditional morphological and bulk macroinvertebrate metabarcoding analyses to benthic samples collected from Toronto Harbour (Ontario, Canada) to compare taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrates and their responses to environmental gradients. At the species rank, sites assessed using COI metabarcoding showed more variation than sites assessed using morphological methods. Depending on the assessment method, we detected gradients in magnesium (morphological taxa), ammonia (morphological taxa, COI sequence variants), pH (18S sequence variants) as well as gradients in contaminants such as metals (COI & 18S sequence variants) and organochlorines (COI sequence variants). Observed responses to contaminants such as aromatic hydrocarbons and metals align with known patchy distributions in harbour sediments. We determined that the morphological approach may limit the detection of macroinvertebrate responses to lake environmental conditions due to the effort needed to obtain fine level taxonomic assignments necessary to investigate responses. DNA metabarcoding, however, need not be limited to macroinvertebrates, can be automated, and taxonomic assignments are associated with a certain level of accuracy from sequence variants to named taxonomic groups.

However, before biomarkers could be deployed within diagnostic studies, systematic evidence of the robustness of such biomarkers to detect effects is needed. In our study, we present an approach for conducting a meta-analysis of the robustness of gene expression-based biomarkers in soil invertebrates. The approach was developed and trialed for two measurements of gene expression commonly proposed as biomarkers in soil ecotoxicology: earthworm metallothionein (MT) gene expression for metals and earthworm heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene expression for organic chemicals. We collected 294 unique gene expression data points from the literature and used linear mixed-effect models to assess concentration, exposure duration, and species effects on the quantified response. The meta-analysis showed that the expression of earthworm MT was strongly metal concentration dependent, stable over time and species independent. The metal concentration-dependent response was strongest for cadmium, indicating that this gene is a suitable biomarker for this metal. For copper, no clear concentration-dependent response of MT gene expression in earthworms was found, indicating MT is not a reliable biomarker for this metal. For HSP70, overall marginal up-regulation and lack of a concentration-dependent response indicated that this gene is not suitable as a biomarker for organic pollutant effects in earthworms. The present study demonstrates how meta-analysis can be used to assess the status of biomarkers. We encourage colleagues to apply this open-access approach to other biomarkers, as such quantitative assessment is a prerequisite to ensuring that the suitability and limitations of proposed biomarkers are known and stated.

Few studies have examined exposure at reproductive organs. Our aim was to perform a preliminary untargeted metabolomic characterization of menstrual blood, a novel biofluid, to identify environmental toxins present in the endometrium and evaluate the suitability of this sample type for exposome research. Methods: Whole blood menstrual samples were collected from four women using a menstrual cup. Samples were analyzed for small molecules that include both environmental chemicals and endogenous metabolites using untargeted liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA was used to identify differences within and between individuals' menstrual blood metabolomic profiles, and the influence of the sample processing method. To assess the presence of environmental exposures, LC-HRMS chemical profiles were matched to the ToxCast chemical database, which includes 4557 commonly used commercial chemicals. Select compounds were confirmed by comparison to reference standards. Results: PCA of metabolome profiles showed analysis of menstrual blood samples were highly reproducible, with high variability in detected metabolites between participants and low variability between analytical replicates of an individual's sample. Endogenous metabolites detected in menstrual blood samples achieved good coverage of the human blood metabolome. We found 1748 annotations for environmental chemicals, including suspected reproductive toxicants such as phenols, parabens, phthalates, and organochlorines. Storage temperature for the first 24 h did not significantly influence global metabolomic profiles. Conclusion: Our results show chemical exposures linked to reproductive toxicity and endocrine disruption are present in menstrual blood, a sampling medium for the endometrium. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: S.

Merrillii, a species of conifer in the family Taxaceae, is a unique and economically valuable tree species in China. The physiological and biochemical responses of T. grandis seedlings to polystyrene nanoplastics (PSNPs) with a diameter of 100 nm were systematically studied inthe present study. The results showed that nanoplastics enhanced the accumulation of the thiobarbituric acid reactive substance and the activities of catalase and peroxidase. The concentrations of iron, sulfur, and zinc were reduced after nanoplastic exposure. PSNP treatment had an important effect on a series of chemical and genetic indicators of T. grandis, includingantioxidants, small RNA, gene transcription, protein expressions, and metabolite accumulation. Multi-omic analysis revealed that PSNPs modulate terpenoid- and flavonoid-biosynthesis pathways by regulating small RNA transcription and protein expression.

As a result, there is an increasing demand for creative, practical, environmentally acceptable, and inexpensive methodologies to remediate inorganic metals (Hg, Cr, Pb, and Cd) liquidated into the atmosphere, protecting ecosystems. Latest innovations in biological metals have driven natural treatment as a viable substitute for traditional approaches in this area. To eliminate pesticide remains from soil/water sites, technologies such as oxidation, burning, adsorption, and microbial degradation have been established. Bioremediation is a more cost-effective and ecologically responsible means of removing heavy metals than conventional alternatives. As a result, microorganisms have emerged as a necessary component of methyl breakdown and detoxification via metabolic reactions and hereditary characteristics. The utmost operative variant for confiscating substantial metals commencing contaminated soil was A. niger, which had a maximum bioaccumulation efficiency of 98% (Cd) and 43% (Cr). Biosensor bacteria are both environmentally sustainable and cost-effective. As a result, microbes have a range of metal absorption processes that allow them to have higher metal biosorption capabilities. Additionally, the biosorption potential of bacterium, fungus, biofilm, and algae, inherently handled microorganisms that immobilized microbial cells for the elimination of heavy metals, was reviewed in this study.

We reviewed studies on systemic antibiotic use (WHO ATC/DDD category J01) for human health in Indonesia, and synthesized available evidence to identify opportunities for intervention. Methods: We systematically searched five international and national databases for eligible peer-reviewed articles, in English and Indonesian, published between 1 January 2000 and 1 June 2021 including: (1) antibiotic consumption; (2) prescribing appropriateness; (3) antimicrobial stewardship (AMS); (4) consumers’ and providers’ perceptions. Two independent reviewers included studies and extracted data. Study-level data were summarized using random-effects model meta-analysis for consumption and prescribing appropriateness, effect direction analysis for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions, and qualitative synthesis for perception surveys. (PROSPERO: CRD42019134641) Findings: Of 9323 search hits, we included 100 reports on antibiotic consumption (20), prescribing appropriateness (49), AMS interventions (13), and/or perception (25) (8 categorized in >1 domain). The pooled estimate of overall antibiotic consumption was 134.8 DDD per 100 bed-days (95%CI 82.5–187.0) for inpatients and 121.1 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (10.4-231.8) for outpatients. Ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and ampicillin were the most consumed antibiotics in inpatients, and amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and cefadroxil in outpatients. Pooled estimates for overall appropriate prescribing (according to Gyssens method) were 33.5% (18.1–53.4) in hospitals and 49.4% (23.7–75.4) in primary care. Pooled estimates for appropriate prescribing (according to reference guidelines) were, in hospitals, 99.7% (97.4–100) for indication, 84.9% (38.5-98.0) for drug choice, and 6.1% (0.2–63.2) for overall appropriateness, and, in primary care, 98.9% (60.9-100) for indication, 82.6% (50.5–95.7) for drug choice and 10.5% (0.8–62.6) for overall appropriateness. Studies to date evaluating bundled AMS interventions, although sparse and heterogeneous, suggested favourable effects on antibiotic consumption, prescribing appropriateness, guideline compliance, and patient outcomes. Key themes identified in perception surveys were lack of community antibiotic knowledge, and common non-prescription antibiotic self-medication. Interpretation: Context-specific intervention strategies are urgently needed to improve appropriate antibiotic use in Indonesian hospitals and communities, with critical evidence gaps concerning the private and informal healthcare sectors.

The issues of species differences between humans and rodents, the animal ethical concerns and the time and cost required for neurotoxicity studies on in vivo animal models, do limit the use of animal-based models in neurotoxicology. In this context, human cell models appear relevant in elucidating cellular and molecular impacts of neurotoxicants and facilitating prioritization of in vivo testing. The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC® CRL-2266™) is one of the most used cell lines in neurosciences, either undifferentiated or differentiated into neuron-like cells. This review presents the characteristics of the SH-SY5Y cell line and proposes the results of a systematic review of literature on the use of this in vitro cell model for neurotoxicity research by focusing on organic environmental pollutants including pesticides, 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), flame retardants, PFASs, parabens, bisphenols, phthalates, and PAHs. Organic environmental pollutants are widely present in the environment and increasingly known to cause clinical neurotoxic effects during fetal & child development and adulthood. Their effects on cultured SH-SY5Y cells include autophagy, cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, or necrosis), increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of neurotransmitter homeostasis, and alteration of neuritic length.

Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides exposure and their contaminants. We included 12 studies for a total of 6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1%) had a MetS. Overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk of MetS by 30% (95CI 22%–37%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of MetS by 23% (14–32%), as well as for most types of organochlorines: hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53% (28–78%), hexachlorobenzene by 40% (0.01–80%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene by 22% (9–34%), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28% (5–50%), oxychlordane by 24% (1–47%), and transnonchlor by 35% (19–52%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk by 46% (35–56%) using crude data or by 19% (10–29%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for overall pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36% risk increase, 17–55%) and transnonchlor (25% risk increase, 3–48%) with fully-adjusted models. Metaregressions demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk of MetS in comparison to most other pesticides. The risk increased for more recent periods (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by year). We demonstrated an inverse relationship with body mass index and male gender. In conclusion, pesticides exposure is a major risk factor for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data are lacking for other types of pesticides. The risk increased with time, reflecting a probable increase of the use of pesticides worldwide.

However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods and analysis A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Ethics and dissemination Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

However, undesired side effects, unsatisfactory response rates, tumor metastasis, and drug resistance still hinder the further application of ICB therapy against CRC. Advancing ICB with nanotechnology can be game-changing. With the development of immuno-oncology and nanomaterials, various nanoplatforms have been fabricated to enhance the efficacy of ICB in CRC treatment. Herein, this review systematically summarizes these recent nano-strategies according to their mechanisms. Despite their diverse and complex designs, these nanoplatforms have four main mechanisms in enhancing ICB: 1) targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to tumor foci, 2) increasing tumor immunogenicity, 3) remodeling tumor microenvironment, and 4) pre-sensitizing immune systems. Importantly, advantages of nanotechnology in CRC, such as innovating the mode-of-actions of ICB, modulating intestinal microbiome, and integrating the whole process of antigen presentation, are highlighted in this review. In general, this review describes the latest applications of nanotechnology for CRC immunotherapy, and may shed light on the future design of ICB platforms.

In this study, we investigated the potential health effects of organohalogen compounds (OHCs) on thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis and metabolomics in Japanese pet cats. There was a significant negative correlation between concentrations of several contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and THs in cat serum samples. These results suggested that exposure to OHCs causes a decrease in serum TH levels in pet cats. In this metabolomics study, each exposure level of parent compounds (PCBs and PBDEs) and their hydroxylated compounds (OH-PCBs and OH-PBDEs) were associated with their own unique primary metabolic pathways, suggesting that parent and phenolic compounds exhibit different mechanisms of action and biological effects. PCBs were associated with many metabolic pathways, including glutathione and purine metabolism, and the effects were replicated in in-vivo cat PCB administration studies. These results demonstrated that OHC exposure causes chronic oxidative stress in pet cats. PBDEs were positively associated with alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism. Due to the chronic exposure of cats to mixtures of these contaminants, the combination of their respective metabolic pathways may have a synergistic effect. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: K.

Objective: To form a tool (a series of criteria) for detecting potentially inappropriate prescriptions in children, promote clinical rational drug use and reduce risks of medication in children. Methods: Potentially inappropriate prescription propositions for children were collected through a systematic review. Then, the Delphi technique was adopted to form the final criteria. Panelists were asked to use a 5-point Likert scale to rate their agreement with each potentially inappropriate prescription proposition and were encouraged to add new propositions based on their clinical experience and knowledge. After 2 rounds of Delphi survey and propositions were fully revised and improved, the final criteria for identifying potentially inappropriate prescriptions in children were formed. Results: The final criteria for identifying potential inappropriate prescriptions in children has 136 propositions, which were divided into “criteria for children with non-specific diseases/conditions” (71 propositions: 68 for potentially inappropriate medication, 3 for potential prescribing omission) and “criteria for children with specific diseases/conditions” (65 propositions: 55 for potentially inappropriate medication, 10 for potential prescribing omission), according to whether the proposition was about identifying specific risks associated with one drug in children with a specific other diseases/conditions that do not exist in children with other diseases/conditions. Conclusion: A tool for screening potentially inappropriate prescriptions in children is formed to detect potentially inappropriate medication and prescribing omission in pediatrics and is available to all medical professionals liable to prescribe or dispense medicines to children.

This study systematically investigated the comprehensive effects of a typical antibiotic (sulfadimidine, SDM) in livestock and poultry breeding wastewater on the anammox process, with the aim of elucidating the intracellular and extracellular protective mechanisms of the anammox consortia to the antibiotic stress. Results revealed that the high-concentration SDM significantly reduced the specific anammox activity (SAA) by 37.8%. Changes in the abundance of Candidatus Kuenenia showed a similar trend with that of SAA, while other nitrogen-related microorganisms (e.g., Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira) contributed to the nitrogen removal especially during the inhibitory period. Resistance of the anammox consortia to SDM mainly depended on the protection of ARGs and EPS. Network analysis revealed the host range of eARGs was relatively larger than that of iARGs, and intI1 was closely associated with representative denitrifiers. In addition, metaproteomic analysis and molecular docking results indicated that abundant proteins in EPS could detain SDM in the extracellular matrix through forming complex via hydrogen bond.

The study of fetal signals poses specific challenges. Metabolomic analysis of maternal blood, the cord artery (CA), and cord vein (CV), allows simultaneous interrogation of multiple metabolic pathways associated with different modes of labour onset and birth. Methods: Global mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis was performed on serial samples collected from participants during pregnancy, in latent phase of labour, and following birth (CA, CV, and intervillous (IV) blood), from those who spontaneously laboured and birthed vaginally (SL group), had IOL and birthed vaginally (IOL group), or birthed via elective caesarean section (no labour; ECS group). Results: There were clear differences in fetal and maternal steroid, arachidonate and sphingosine pathways between the SL and IOL groups, despite similar uterine contractions and vaginal birth. The CA/CV ratio for key steroids of the IOL group were more alike the ECS group than the SL group, including progesterone (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=3.5; IOL group=0.5; and ECS group=0.5), and oestriol (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=4.3; IOL group=0.4; and for ECS group=0.2). There were no such changes in the maternal samples. Discussion: These findings indicate that IOL does not reproduce the pathways activated in spontaneous labour. The decreased placental progesterone production observed with spontaneous labour may represent a local intrauterine progesterone withdrawal, which, together with other signals, would activate parturition pathways involving arachidonate and sphingosine metabolism. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.A.

Despite their abundance in AFFF, information is lacking on the potential transformation of these polyfluoroalkyl substances. Due to the biological and chemical stability of the repeating perfluoroalkyl -(CF2)n- moiety common to all known AFFF-derived PFASs, it is not immediately evident whether the microbial biotransformation mechanisms observed for other organic contaminants also govern the microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Herein, we aim to: 1) review the literature on the aerobic or anaerobic microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental media; 2) compile and summarize proposed microbial biotransformation pathways for major classes of polyfluoroalkyl substances; 3) identify the dominant biotransformation intermediates and terminal biotransformation products; and 4) discuss these findings in the context of environmental monitoring and source allocation. This analysis revealed that much more is currently known about aerobic microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances, as compared to anaerobic biotransformation. Further, there are some similarities in microbial biotransformations of fluorotelomer and electrochemical fluorination-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, but differences may be largely due to head group composition. Dealkylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic reactions appear to be particularly important for microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, and these biotransformations may lead to formation of some semi-stable intermediates.

Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures’ effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods. Specific guidelines and tools for quality assessment and publication of mixture observational studies are warranted. © 2021","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: C.

Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 78; Correspondence Address: T.J.

We combined a meta-analysis of nationwide measurements and air quality modeling to identify efficiency gains by striking a balance between controlling NH3 and acid gas (SO2 and NOx) emissions. We found that PM2.5 concentrations decreased from 2000 to 2019, but annual mean PM2.5 concentrations still exceeded 35 μgm-3 at 74% of 1498 monitoring sites during 2015-2019. The concentration of PM2.5 and its components were significantly higher (16 %-195 %) on hazy days than on non-hazy days. Compared with mean values of other components, this difference was more significant for the secondary inorganic ions SO2-4, NO-3, and NHC4+ (average increase 98 %). While sulfate concentrations significantly decreased over this period, no significant change was observed for nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Model simulations indicate that the effectiveness of a 50% NH3 emission reduction for controlling secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) concentrations decreased from 2010 to 2017 in four megacity clusters of eastern China, simulated for the month of January under fixed meteorological conditions (2010). Although the effectiveness further declined in 2020 for simulations including the natural experiment of substantial reductions in acid gas emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting reductions in SIA concentrations were on average 20.8% lower than those in 2017. In addition, the reduction in SIA concentrations in 2017 was greater for 50% acid gas reductions than for the 50% NH3 emission reductions. Our findings indicate that persistent secondary inorganic aerosol pollution in China is limited by emissions of acid gases, while an additional control of NH3 emissions would become more important as reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions progress.

Xenobiotic metabolism, transformation, excretion, and coexistence with other endogenous molecules, however, greatly complicate the interpretation of features detected in nontargeted studies. While mass spectrometry (MS)-based platforms are commonly used in metabolomic measurements, deconvoluting endogenous metabolites from xenobiotics is also often challenged by the lack of xenobiotic parent and metabolite standards as well as the numerous isomers possible for each small molecule m/z feature. Here, we evaluate a xenobiotic structural annotation workflow using ion mobility spectrometry coupled with MS (IMS-MS), mass defect filtering, and machine learning to uncover potential xenobiotic classes and species in large metabolomic feature lists. Xenobiotic classes examined included those of known high toxicities, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and pesticides. Specifically, when the workflow was applied to identify PFAS in the NIST SRM 1957 and 909c human serum samples, it greatly reduced the hundreds of detected liquid chromatography (LC)-IMS-MS features by utilizing both mass defect filtering and m/z versus IMS collision cross sections relationships. These potential PFAS features were then compared to the EPA CompTox entries, and while some matched within specific m/z tolerances, there were still many unknowns illustrating the importance of nontargeted studies for detecting new molecules with known chemical characteristics. Additionally, this workflow can also be utilized to evaluate other xenobiotics and enable more confident annotations from nontargeted studies. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

These maps can provide an overview of available studies and relevant study information to be used for various research objectives and applications. Environmental epidemiological studies that examine the impact of chemical exposures on various ‘omic profiles in human populations provide relevant mechanistic information and can be used for benchmark dose modeling to derive potential human health reference values. Objectives: To create a systematic evidence map of environmental epidemiological studies examining environmental contaminant exposures with ‘omics in order to characterize the extent of available studies for future research needs. Methods: Systematic review methods were used to search and screen the literature and included the use of machine learning methods to facilitate screening studies. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were developed to identify and screen relevant studies. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were summarized with information such as study population, study design, sample size, exposure measurement, and ‘omics analysis. Results: Over 10,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes were used to identify 84 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Various contaminants (e.g. phthalate, benzene, arsenic, etc.) were investigated in epidemiological studies that used one or more of the four ‘omics of interest: epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The epidemiological study designs that were used to explore single or integrated ‘omic research questions with contaminant exposures were cohort studies, controlled trials, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. An interactive web-based systematic evidence map was created to display more study-related information. Conclusions: This systematic evidence map is a novel tool to visually characterize the available environmental epidemiological studies investigating contaminants and biological effects using ‘omics technology and serves as a resource for investigators and allows for a range of applications in chemical research and risk assessment needs. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: S.

Results: Bulking agents that are used nowadays are the glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine collagen, polydimethylsiloxane, calcium hydroxyapatite, porcine dermal implants, carbon coated zirconium beads, and the polyacrylamide hydrogel. Cure rates of bulking agents are lower compared to surgical management. Periurethral injection was found to be beneficial in patients who refuse or who are inadequate for surgical management, or after the failure of the latter. It can be performed via paraurethral or transurethral routes, with comparable efficacy. Ultrasonic, radiographic or endoscopic assistance allow better precision and control of the procedure. Paraurethral route is associated with bigger injected volumes, higher costs, and more complications.

Digestive gland is the key organ of aquatic animal metabolism for storing nutrition and supplying energy. It participates in a variety of life activities (such as growth, digestion, immunity, and reproduction). Nutrients stored in digestive glands, especially lipids, provide energy for reproductive behaviors such as gametogenesis and ovulation. A large number of studies have confirmed the accumulation of lipids from digestive gland to gonad during gametogenesis. At present, the research on the interference mechanism of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on lipid metabolism of aquatic animals and the adaptive response of aquatic animals to POPs stress focus on biochemical levels or a few genes. The potential molecular mechanism of lipid metabolism interference needs to be further studied. In addition, as an important stage of aquatic animals, the reproductive period is a vigorous period of lipid metabolism. However, at present, there is no report on the molecular mechanism of POPs interfering with the lipid metabolism of the digestive gland in the reproductive process of aquatic animals. In this study, female scallop C. farreri was cultured in natural seawater and exposed to 4 μg/L B[a]P in seawater. Transcriptome analysis of digestive glands at multiple stages (proliferative stage, growth stage, mature stage and spawn stage) was performed, and iPath pathway analysis was used to analyze lipid metabolism pathways and differential genes. The interference mechanism of lipid metabolism in bivalves during reproductive period was revealed. This study will provide valuable genomic information on the role of digestive glands in lipid metabolism and reproduction of C. farreri, and will contribute to further functional genomics of bivalves and other closely related species. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: L.

Typically, EPs are widely disseminated in the aquatic ecosystem and capable of perturbing the physiology of water bodies as well as humans. The primary sources of EPs in the environment include anthropogenic release, atmospheric deposition, untreated or substandard treated wastewater, and extreme weather events. Intensive research has been done covering the environmental distribution, ecological disturbance, fate, and removal of EPs in the past decades. However, a systematic review on the distribution of EPs in the engineered and natural aquatic environment and the degradation of different EPs by using anaerobic sludge, aerobic bacteria, and isolated strains are limited. This review article aims to highlight the importance, application, and future perceptions of using different microbes to degrade EPs. Overall, this review article illustrates the superiority of using non-cultivable and cultivable microbes to degrade the EPs as an eco-friendly approach.

This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health.

Little is known, however, about the prevalence of bacterial dechlorination in deep terrestrial environments with a limited carbon supply. In this study we analyzed published genomes from three deep terrestrial subsurface sites: a deep aquifer in Western Siberia, the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, USA, and the Soudan Underground Iron Mine (SUIM) in Minnesota, USA to determine if there was evidence to suggest that microbial dehalogenation was possible in these environments. Diverse dehalogenase genes were present in all analyzed metagenomes, with reductive dehalogenase and haloalkane dehalogenase genes the most common. Taxonomic analysis of both hydrolytic and reductive dehalogenase genes was performed to explore their affiliation; this analysis indicated that at the SUIM site, hydrolytic dehalogenase genes were taxonomically affiliated with Marinobacter species. Because of this affiliation, experiments were also performed with Marinobacter subterrani strain JG233 ('JG233'), an organism containing three predicted hydrolytic dehalogenase genes and isolated from the SUIM site, to determine whether hydrolytic dehalogenation was an active process and involved in growth on a chlorocarboxylic acid. Presence of these genes in genome appears to be functional, as JG233 was capable of chloroacetate dechlorination with simultaneous chloride release. Stable isotope experiments combined with confocal Raman microspectroscopy demonstrated that JG233 incorporated carbon from 13C-chloroacetate into its biomass. These experiments suggest that organisms present in these extreme and often low-carbon environments are capable of reductive and hydrolytic dechlorination and, based on laboratory experiments, may use this capability as a competitive advantage by utilizing chlorinated organic compounds for growth, either directly or after dechlorination.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score = 6.20, p < 0:001), PFOS (z-score = 3.55, p < 0:001), and PFNA (z-score = 2.27, p = 0:023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10092. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Objectives: This study aimed to provide the first comparison of steroids + local anesthetic (LA) or LA alone for the treatment of DDD. Study Design: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the clinical efficacy of both the steroids + LA group and the LA alone group, and subgroup analysis was also adopted. Setting: A systematic review and meta-analysis using a random effects model on randomized controlled studies (RCTs). Methods: After reviewing titles, abstracts, risk of bias, and full texts of 15,889 studies that were chosen following removal of duplicates after the initial database search, finally, 19 RCTs were included. Pain rating, functional score, follow-up period, and other-related data were extracted from these included works, and the effect size and statistical significance were calculated by the random effects model. The quality and level of the derived evidence were assessed by means of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. Results: In terms of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at one year, the combination of steroids + LA was obviously superior to LA. Subgroup analysis suggested that the combination of steroids + LA was more effective than LA alone in regard to the ODI in the lumbar group within 2 years. The opioids intake of patients treated by LA alone was less than that of the steroids + LA group within 3 months, and LA alone was more effective in pain score reduction, with more than 50% within 6 months in the interlaminar injection group. However, the combination of steroids + LA was more effective when alleviating the NRS-11 within 18 months in the caudal injection group. Limitations: Firstly, this analysis was inconsistent in technique, dosage, injection frequency, and follow-up period of epidural injections. Such differences may compromise the reported efficacy. Secondly, adverse reactions arising out of the 2 groups were not examined in that the included RCTs did not provide the data. Thirdly, different injection methods would compromise the outcomes, and no subgroup analysis was performed on different injection methods. Finally, these included articles that were mainly sourced from Manchikanti’s team, and thus biased to some extent. Conclusions: The addition of steroids to anesthetic injectates was associated with a better NRS-11 and ODI compared with LA alone within one year in patients with DDD. Furthermore, the improvement of the ODI was observed within 2 years in patients with lumbar DDD. © 2022, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

EPs are detected in all the environmental matrices at higher levels. A suitable model for aquatic toxicity assessment is Hydra, because of morphological, behavioral, reproductive (sexual and asexual), and biochemical changes. Many researchers have used Hydra for toxicity assessment of organic chemicals (BPA), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials and microplastics. Various Hydra species were used for environmental toxicity studies; however H. magnipapillata was predominantly used due to the availability of its genome and proteome sequences. Teratogenic and reproductive changes in Hydra are species specific. Teratogenic effects were studied using sterozoom dissecting microscope, acridine orange (AO) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DPAI) staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by EPs had been understood by the Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFDA) staining and comet assay. Multiple advanced techniques would aid to understand the effects at molecular level, such as real-time PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA end- PCR. EPs modulated the major antioxidant enzyme levels, therefore, defense mechanism was affected by the higher generation of reactive oxygen species.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and provide insight into what types of nutrients and pollutants seabirds are transporting, the influence these subsidies are having on recipient environments, with a particular focus on soil, and what may happen if seabird populations decline. The addition of guano to colony soils increased nutrient levels compared to control soils for all seabirds studied, with cascading positive effects observed across a range of habitats. Deposited guano sometimes led to negative impacts, such as guanotrophication, or guano-induced eutrophication, which was often observed where there was an excess of guano or in areas with high seabird densities. While the literature describing nutrients transported by seabirds is extensive, literature regarding pollutant transfer is comparatively limited, with a focus on toxic and bioaccumulative metals. Research on persistent organic pollutants and plastics transported by seabirds is likely to increase in coming years. Studies were limited geographically, with hotspots of research activity in a few locations, but data were lacking from large regions around the world. Studies were also limited to seabird species listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. As seabird populations are impacted by multiple threats and steep declines have been observed for many species world-wide, gaps in the literature are particularly concerning. The loss of seabirds will impact nutrient cycling at localized levels and potentially on a global scale as well, yet it is unknown what may truly happen to areas that rely on seabirds if these populations disappear. © 2022 The Authors.

To address this need, 113 participants among households served by a range of water providers across the Guatemala City metropolitan area were recruited as participatory scientists to collect first-draw and flushed tap water samples at their residence. Samples were transported to the U.S. and analyzed for 20 metals and 25 per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). At least one metal exceeded the Guatemalan Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) for drinking water in 63% of households (n = 71). Arsenic and lead exceeded the MPL in 33.6% (n = 38) and 8.9% (n = 10) of samples, respectively. Arsenic was strongly associated with groundwater while lead occurrence was not associated with location, water source, or provider. One or more PFAS were detected in 19% of samples (n = 21, range 2.1–64.2 ppt). PFAS were significantly associated with the use of plastic water storage tanks but not with location, water source, or provider. Overall, the high prevalence of arsenic above the MPL in Guatemala City tap water represents a potential health risk that current water treatment processes are not optimized to remove. Furthermore, potential contaminants from premise plumbing and storage, including lead and PFAS, represent additional risks requiring further investigation and public engagement. © 2022 by the authors.

This study analyzed the trace metals and organochlorine pesticides residues and the associated human health risk in 33 imported fishes (9 species) from four countries (India, Myanmar, Oman, and United Arab Emirates) collected from three different ports (Benapole, Bhomra, and Chittagong) of Bangladesh with invoice lists from the port authorities. Trace metal concentrations were determined using graphite furnace absorption spectrometry and flame absorption spectrometry. The two organochlorine pesticides (Aldrin and Chlordane) residues were determined by GC–MS and found as below detection level (BDL). The trace metal concentrations (mg/kg-ww) in imported fish samples ranged as As 0.008 to 0.558, Pb 0.004 to 0.070, Cr 0.010 to 0.109, Cd 0.00 to 0.083, Ni 0.011 to 0.059, Co BDL to 0.067, Mn BDL to 0.0780, Fe 1.780 to 10.77, Cu 0.055 to 0.632, and Zn 0.898 to 9.245. Concentrations of As and Cd were higher than the food safety guideline. Considering the source country of imported fishes, fish samples from Oman were mostly contaminated by the trace metals. The estimated daily intake (EDI) was higher for Cr. However, the target hazard quotient (THQ) for individual metal and total THQ for combined metals were lower than 1, indicating no apparent non-carcinogenic health risk for consumers. The cancer risk (CR) was within the acceptable range. But extensive monitoring of these toxic chemicals is needed prior to import these fishes to the country. Given the self-sufficiency in fish production, this study also argues whether Bangladesh needs to import the fishes at all. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: M.

Chronic PFAS exposure have been linked to increased prostate cancer risk in occupational settings, however, underlying mechanisms have not been interrogated. Herein we examined exposure of normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (SPCs) to 10 nM PFOA or PFOS using serial passage of prostasphere cultures. Exposure to either PFAS for 3–4 weeks increased spheroid numbers and size indicative of elevated stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showed 1) SPC expression of PPARs and RXRs able to mediate PFAS effects, 2) the emergence of a new cell cluster of aberrantly differentiated luminal progenitor cells upon PFOS/PFOA exposure, and 3) enrichment of cancer-associated signaling pathways. Metabolomic analysis of PFAS-exposed prostaspheres revealed increased glycolytic pathways including the Warburg effect as well as strong enrichment of serine and glycine metabolism which may promote a pre-malignant SPC fate. Finally, growth of in vivo xenografts of tumorigenic RWPE-2 human prostate cells, shown to contain cancer stem-like cells, was markedly enhanced by daily PFOS feeding to nude mice hosts. Together, these findings are the first to identify human prostate SPCs as direct PFAS targets with resultant reprogrammed transcriptomes and metabolomes that augment a preneoplastic state and may contribute to an elevated prostate cancer risk with chronic exposures. © 2021","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: G.S.

Methods: A recall-by-genotype study was implemented in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Samples from 756 participants were selected for untargeted metabolomics analysis based on low versus high genetic liability for higher BMI defined by a genetic risk score (GRS). Regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between BMI GRS group and relative abundance of 973 metabolites. Results: After correction for multiple testing, 29 metabolites were associated with BMI GRS group. Bilirubin was among the most strongly associated metabolites, with reduced levels measured in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.32, 95% CI: −0.46 to −0.18, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.005). This study observed associations between BMI GRS group and the levels of several potentially diet-related metabolites, including hippurate, which had lower mean abundance in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.29, 95% CI: −0.44 to −0.15, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.008). Conclusions: Together with existing literature, these results suggest that a genetic predisposition to higher BMI captures differences in metabolism leading to adiposity gain.

Without effective treatment in the foreseeable future, it is essential to focus on modifiable risk factors and early intervention. Central auditory processing is impaired in people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and its preclinical stages and may manifest many years before clinical diagnosis. This study systematically reviewed central auditory processing function in AD and its preclinical stages using behavioural central auditory processing tests.

The use of insecticides has been one of the major tools in pest control. However, the development of insecticide resistance has been a major problem in the control of insect pest populations that threaten the health of both humans and plants. The overexpression of detoxification genes is thought to be one of the major mechanisms through which pests develop resistance to insecticides. Hundreds of research papers have explored how overexpressed detoxification genes increase the resistance status of insects to an insecticide in recent years. This study is, for the first time, a synthesis of these resistance and gene expression data aimed at (1) setting up an example for the application of meta-analysis in the investigation of the mechanisms of insecticide resistance and (2) seeking to determine if the overexpression detoxification genes are responsible for insecticide resistance in insect pests in general. A strong correlation of increased levels of insecticide resistance has been observed in tested insects with cytochrome P450 (CYP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and esterase gene superfamilies, confirming that the overexpression of detoxification genes is indeed involved in the insecticide resistance through the increased metabolism of insecticides of insects, including medically (e.g., mosquito and housefly) and agriculturally (e.g., planthopper and caterpillar) important insects.

However, although physical/chemical cleaning and membrane module replacement can overcome the inherent limitations caused by membrane fouling and other membrane separation processes, high operating costs limit their practical applications. In this review, common preparation methods for TiO2 photocatalytic membranes are described in detail, and the main approaches to enhancing their photocatalytic performance are discussed. More importantly, the mechanism of the TiO2 photocatalytic membrane antifouling process is elucidated, and some applications of photocatalytic membranes in other areas are described.

Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per-and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement–only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with ≥21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The dependence of the parasite on the host hemoglobin could lead to increased disease severity in the host. In this study, molecular docking analyses were used to evaluate the binding interactions of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide analogues to P. falciparum falcilysin. The protein databank and the CheBI database were used to find P. falciparum falcilysin and the compounds, respectively. The protein and the collected compounds were imported into PyRx virtual screening software and the docking was initiated. Following that, Discovery Studio was utilized to virtualize the 2D and 3D interactions. The binding energies of 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4""-disulfonate and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4""-disulfonic acid were both more than-10.0 kcal/mol among the phenanthroline analogues while only oleanolic acid and N-ethylsuccinimide-mycothiol conjugate from the dipicolinic acid and N-ethylmaleimide analogues had binding energies of-9.7 and-9.4 kcal/mol respectively. The higher binding energies were attributable to hydrogen bond interactions as well as other interactions between the chemicals and the amino acid residues of the falcilysin. The analogues were shown to be moderately safe in pharmacokinetic investigations and scaled Lipinski's rule of five (RO5). The findings of the study revealed that analogues of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide could serve as potential inhibitors of P. falciparum falcilysin.

The current study aimed to provide an updated and comprehensive assessment of the association between SSRI use and development of HCC. Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational studies published until June 2021. We comprehensively searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase to identify studies comparing SSRIs use with control in relation to the risk of HCC. We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between SSRI use and incident HCC risk using random-effects meta-analysis. A dose–response analysis was conducted to evaluate the HCC risk according to the defined daily dose (DDD) of SSRI use. Results: Eight observational studies, comprising 1,051,096 participants and 22,316 incidences of HCC, examining the association between SSRIs use and HCC risk, were included in the systematic review (adjusted RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.56–0.79; P ≤ 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the magnitude of benefit associated with SSRIs was significantly higher in patients with hepatitis infection (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51–0.95) than the general population (Pheterogeneity = 0.700). The dose–response analysis indicated strong inverse association between cumulative DDD of SSRI and risk of HCC (coefficient: − 0.0030; P = 0.002; R2 = 0.78). Conclusions: The results of this review show that SSRI use was associated with a 34% lower risk of HCC, which tend to be dose dependent. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these observations across the spectrum of chronic liver disease and hepatitis infection. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: W.

However, the determination of the key toxicants that consider the combined effects of all sediment-related contaminants are still challenging and necessary for an appropriate sediment risk assessment. The effects of sediments on aquatic organisms have been reported in Liaohe River, but their key toxicity factors are not well known. To determine the key toxicity factors, twenty-six surface sediment samples from Liaohe River tributaries in Northeast China were collected. Acute toxicity test of midge larvae results showed that 6 of 26 tributaries had obvious toxic effects, with survival rates of 37%–57% (p < 0.05). The masking test showed that the main pollutants in the surface sediments of T7 and T16 were metals, that of T8 was an organic pollutant, those of T19 and T26 were organic pollutants and ammonia, and those of T17 were heavy metal and ammonia. Chemical analysis showed that the relatively high concentrations of ammonia were only presented in surface sediments of T17, T19, and T26, with PTU of 1.5, 1.2 and 1.1, respectively, whereas heavy metals were markedly high in surface sediments from T7 and T16, with PTU of 0.92 and 0.61, respectively. Interestingly, the observed toxicity in surface sediments agreed with the toxicity predicted by chemical analysis Moreover, the significant correlation between the survival and volume ratio of the sediment and overlying water confirmed ammonia nitrogen was key toxicity factor in T17, T19, and T26, whereas Cu was the key toxicity factor in T7 that cause the biological toxicity. In conclusion, the major toxic factors of ammonia and copper in the sediments were identified.

The key to disease prevention is to clarify the harmful mechanisms and toxic effects of environmental pollutants on the body. Metabolomics is a high-sensitivity, high-throughput omics technology that can obtain detailed metabolite information of an organism. It is a crucial tool for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the pathway network regulation mechanism of the organism. Its application is widespread in many research fields such as environmental exposure assessment, medicine, systems biology, and biomarker discovery. Aim of review: Recent findings show that metabolomics can be used to obtain molecular snapshots of organisms after environmental exposure, to help understand the interaction between environmental exposure and organisms, and to identify potential biomarkers and biological mechanisms. Key scientific concepts of review: This review focuses on the application of metabolomics to understand the biological effects of radiation, heavy metals, air pollution, and persistent organic pollutants exposure, and examines some potential biomarkers and toxicity mechanisms. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: L.

Post-surgical imaging of mesh is useful when complications including mesh erosion, bleeding, and chronic pain arise. Different types of mesh coated with various materials have been developed to improve visibility on imaging studies. However, localization of surgical mesh after implantation remains challenging as visualization with standard imaging is difficult. The purpose of this study was to review the various radiologic approaches to characterizing synthetic surgical meshes. Recent Findings: A systematic and comprehensive literature search was performed by two independent reviewers using the PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine to identify all potentially relevant publications published before April 2020. Studies assessing the use of imaging for surgical mesh in both urogynecologic and non-urogyneocologic procedures were included. Iron impregnated mesh was most visible on imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Impregnated mesh was also shown to be more readily visible on ultrasound when compared to its non-iron containing counterpart. Non-impregnated expanded polytetrafluorethylene mesh (EPTF Mesh) was visible on CT and MRI. The more commonly used polypropylene and polyvinylidene mesh were more readily visualized on ultrasound although localization of surrounding structures remains difficult. Summary: Imaging surgical mesh poses an ongoing problem when complications arise. Although particle impregnated mesh is visible on CT and MRI, the adoption of this practice is still in its infancy. The ability to visualize EPTF mesh on CT and MRI is a promising advancement, but proper visualization of the more common synthetic meshes remains a limitation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: B.

The surface water samples of the reservoirs were collected at multiple points, the bacteria in the water samples were collected by centrifugation. The bacterial DNAs were extracted by CTAB method, the V3-V4 regions were amplified with bacterial 16S rDNA universal primer followed by high-throughput sequencing. The software and online tools including BLAST, USEARCH and QIIME were used to analyze the bacterial diversity, and the functional gene compositions were predicted using PICRUSt software and KEGG database. The results showed that the bacteria from the four reservoirs belonged to 18 phyla, 38 classes and 181 genera, the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) number and diversity index of AJW was higher. There was something in common in the bacterial community compositions of the four reservoirs. The Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria at the phylum level, Flavobacteria was the dominant bacteria at the class level, and Flavobacterium was the dominant bacteria at the genus level. However, there were great differences in the bacterial community compositions of the four reservoirs. In Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria showed a higher relative abundance in MGW and BYW, and Alphaproteobacterial and Betaproteobacteria showed a higher relative abundance in AJW and KCW, respectively; Bacillus exhibited a higher relative abundance in AJW and MGW; other bacteria with higher abundance included Planomicrobium in AJW, Massilia in KCW, Acinetobacter and Planomicrobium in MGW, and Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter in BYW; in addition, some specific high- abundance classes and genera were found in AJW, among them, both Exiguobacterium and CL500-29_marine_group were conducive to maintaining the water quality and bacterial diversity. PICRUSt function prediction analysis indicated that the genes of the bacterial community in four reservoirs related to metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing and cellular processes showed relatively a high abundance. In addition, some bacterial genes were related to the biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds, and the relative abundances of genes related to degradation of benzoate, aminobenzoate, chloroalkane and chloroalkene, and naphthalene were higher. In summary, the compositions of the bacterial community in different reservoirs were varied, which could be related to the water source, surrounding environment, and human activities. The presence of the genes related to the degradation of aromatic compounds and organochlorine compounds in the reservoirs could play a potential role in pollutant degradation and bioremediation. © 2022 Science Press.

We examined the extent to which variation in hospital antibiotic prescribing is associated with mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Methods: This ecological analysis examined Hospital Episode Statistics from 36,124,372 acute/general medicine admissions (≥16y) to 135 acute hospitals in England, 01/April/2010–31/March/2017. Random-effects meta-regression was used to investigate whether heterogeneity in adjusted 30-day mortality was associated with hospital-level antibiotic use, measured in defined-daily-doses (DDD)/1,000 bed-days. Models also considered DDDs/1,000 admissions and DDDs for narrow-spectrum/broad-spectrum antibiotics, parenteral/oral, and local interpretations of World Health Organization Access, Watch, and Reserve antibiotics. Results: Hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days varied 15-fold with comparable variation in broad-spectrum, parenteral, and Reserve antibiotic use. After extensive adjusting for hospital case-mix, the probability of 30-day mortality changed -0.010% (95% CI: -0.064,+0.044) for each increase of 500 hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days. Analyses of other metrics of antibiotic use showed no consistent association with mortality risk. Conclusions: We found no evidence that wide variation in hospital antibiotic use is associated with adjusted mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Using low-prescribing hospitals as benchmarks could help drive safe and substantial reductions in antibiotic consumption of up-to one-third in this population. © 2021","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: E.P.

However, investigations into the contamination of ARGs in mining areas have been scarce. Here, the types, abundances, and influencing factors of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were investigated in soil/sediment of the Dexing copper mine area in June 2019 by using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HT-qPCR). Furthermore, the influence of heavy metals and MGEs factors on ARGs was studied using the multivariate statistical analysis method. The results showed that there were a variety of ARGs in the Dexing copper mining area, and the maximum detected number of ARGs was 70. At the relative abundance level, the relative abundance of individual sites reached 0.085. In the Dexing copper mine, multidrug, MLSB, β-lactamases, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the dominant ARG classes based on their numbers. The efflux pump was the most dominant resistance mechanism, followed by antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection. There was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of ARGs and MGEs (P<0.05), and TnpA04 and Inti1 were the most important MEGs in Dexing copper mine samples, indicating that horizontal gene transfer might be an important mechanism for the spread of environmental ARGs. The results of Pearson correlation analysis and RDA analysis showed that the content of Cu was significantly positively correlated with the detected numbers and abundance of ARGs (P<0.05), suggesting that the high content of Cu in the Dexing copper mining area might be an important driving factor for the formation of ARGs. © 2022, Science Press.

Henceforward, the present study reveals a novel bacterial species isolated from pesticide-contaminated soil for enhanced endosulfan degradation. Next, isolated bacterial species was characterized with biochemical assays and 16S rRNA sequencing technique. Subsequently, the optimal conditions for endosulfan biodegradation such as pH, concentration of endosulfan, and bacterial growth were estimated with non-sulfur medium (NSM). Sequentially, the amount of endosulfan and compound degradation were analyzed through thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Overall, the obtained results revealed the endosulfan acting as primary carbon source for bacterial growth. From the GC-MS analysis, the metabolic products released during endosulfan degradation by Pseudomonas sp. MSCAS BT01 were compared with standard GC-MS spectra. The highest (98%) endosulfan degradation was obtained at pH 7.0. The complete endosulfan degradation was achieved at 14th day of incubation and the less toxic endosulfan diol produced was observed via GC-MS. To conclude, the pesticide-contaminated isolate Pseudomonas sp.

Legislation with aim to eliminate and ban EDs have been introduced in EU, but the identification of EDs remains challenging and crucial step towards regulation and risk management. A guidance for ED assessment has been recently established for pesticides and biocides in the EU, which heavily relies on traditional toxicological testing in vivo. Most notably lacking mechanistic methods for some ED modalities and not covering many other modalities that might be affected by EDs. In this project, we focus on the ED assessment according to the valid legislation and explore the possibility to employ alternative methods to bolster the mechanistic understanding of the ED effects and eventually decrease the need for in vivo testing. We selected a well-studied industrial chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to be a model compound in a case study for ED assessment where the EU criteria were applied in the frame of human health risk assessment with focus on thyroid disruption and developmental neurotoxicity. A systematic literature review has been conducted for these effects (Scopus, Pubmed, Embase), and relevant studies were selected by title/abstract screening (RAYYAN) and full-text examination. Selected studies were assessed for reliability (SciRAP), and all relevant data were extracted into a database and assessed by Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach. The initial analysis showed potential endocrine adverse effects and endocrine activity, meeting the ED criteria. The use of mechanistic and alternative methods enhanced the outcomes of WoE assessment. Also, the study provides a great hands-on experience with the most up-to-date development in the area of risk assessment and EDs. © 2022 Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

Various pollutants in soils may harm human health through the food chain. At present, the commonly used remediated methods mainly include thermal treatment, electrokinetic remediation, stabilization/solidification, soil washing, and bioremediation. Among them, ball milling is a non-combustion technology with simple operation, green, and mild reaction conditions as well as wide applicability, and it is promising in the decontamination of soil pollutants. Ball milling techniques have been gradually used for the detoxification of persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals in contaminated soils, while related reviews focusing on ball milling for soil remediation are limited. It is necessary to fully understand the potential and applied value of ball milling for remediation of contaminated soils. Ball milling has different effects and mechanisms for different pollutants and soil types. Therefore, there is a need to systematically review and digest the relevant knowledge on ball milling remediation of contaminated soils. In this review, the main types of ball milling and influencing factors are summarized, and the mechanisms of ball milling for soil remediation are analyzed. Finally, the problems which need to be solved are briefly described and the future research direction and trend are pointed out.

Peer-reviewed journal articles on ecotoxicology and bioremediation from the years 1974–2020 (cutoff date September 2020) were selected for meta-analysis to quantify the effect size of earthworms on organic pollutant degradation. The meta-analysis shows that the average effect size of earthworms on organic pollutant degradation is 128.5% (p < 0.05). Soils with high soil organic matter or clay textures are more conducive to earthworm-mediated removal of organic pollutants. Structural equation modeling reveals that earthworms’ sensitivity to contaminant exposure may be a greater limiting factor on pollutant degradation than environmental factors. In addition, the quantitative relationship existed between LC50 and the pollutants’ degradation that an elevated LC50 threshold resulted in at least 1.5 times increase in the pollutants’ degradation size. This correlation was dually confirmed via meta-analysis and the validation trial.

It was found that, compared to the worldwide average, Pakistan had high consumptions of pesticides, with an alarming increase of 1169% in the last two decades. The quantities of pesticides used followed an order of pyrethroids > organophosphates > organochlorines > carbamates, but organochlorines were the most problematic due to their environmental occurrence, the ability to transport across the media, and identified human and ecological toxicities. Additionally, the misuse or overuse of pesticides by farmers is prevailing due to insufficient knowledge about the risks, which leads to high risks in occupational exposure. These issues are further aggravated by the illegal use or continuous impacts of banned organochlorine pesticides. For the future, we suggested the establishment of organized monitoring, assessment, and reporting program based on environmental laws to minimize contamination and exposure to pesticides in Pakistan.

In this study, we performed a combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis to investigate the proteomic and metabolic alterations in MLTC-1 Leydig cells responsive to low levels of PFOA exposure. The results showed that PFOA significantly regulated the expressions of 67 proteins and 17 metabolites, among which 18 proteins and 7 metabolites were specifically tied to lipid and fatty acid metabolism as well as testicular steroidogenesis. It is further suggested that low-dose PFOA stimulates steroid hormone synthesis by accelerating fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenic process, which is involved in the repression of p38 and cAMP-dependent ERK signaling pathway. The animal studies also revealed that environmentally relevant levels of PFOA increased serum steroid hormone levels accompanied by the activated cAMP and inhibited p38/ERK pathway in testis, which confirmed our in vitro findings.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of PFA and TKA by evaluation of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: We systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Meta-analysis software was used to screen for potential articles with at least two years’ follow-up. Data were extracted and analysed for all PROMs operating time, postoperative inpatient time, complications and cost. We included five studies in our cumulative meta-analysis and reviewed them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used random-effect models. Results: No significant difference was found between both TKA and PFA in the context of operating time. No significant difference after five years’ follow-up was found between the two treatment options in terms of UCLA score and patient satisfaction. PFA showed significant improvement in WOMAC score at five-year follow-up, less postoperative inpatient time, better cost-effectiveness and significantly less blood loss. Conclusion: PFA seems to be a viable alternative to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients.

Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. Results: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from −181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = −360.620 to −1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to −24.252 g (95% CI = −38.574 to −9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be “moderate”. Conclusion: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and fully considering the possible confounders.

The interaction between these emerging pollutants can induce several effects on environmental and human health. Thus, the current study aimed to summarize and discuss the literature on the interactions and ecotoxicity of MP/NPs with pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. A scientometric and systematic review was conducted, and the data were summarized and discussed. The historical analysis indicated that the first article on the interactive effects between MP/NPs and pharmaceuticals was published in 2016. Scientific production is emerging in fourteen countries. Several types of MP/NPs (n = 13) and pharmaceuticals (n = 65) were studied, while the toxicity was evaluated in 30 articles (37.04 %). The interaction of MP/NPs with several pharmaceutical groups was confirmed, mainly antibiotics. In general, results confirmed the Trojan horse effects and indicated that MP/NPs changed the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals. The data reviewed demonstrated that future studies under environmentally relevant conditions are necessary for a better understanding of the mechanisms of action and toxicity of pharmaceuticals adsorbed to MP/NPs, especially mixtures with NPs. This study confirms that MP/NPs can alter the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals in aquatic organisms, indicating their potential toxicological risk. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: T.L.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between four types of EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates (PAEs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) and markers of inflammation and immune responses in humans. Three databases were searched, and 36 studies with a total of 22055 participants were included. The associations between EDCs and 26 inflammation-related acute phase proteins and cytokines were analyzed. The results demonstrated that exposure to BPA was positively associated with circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6. Exposure to PAEs was associated with elevated levels of CRP, IL-6 and IL-10. Subgroup analysis found that three PAE metabolites mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were directly associated with a higher level of CRP, and two other PAE metabolites mono-carboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP) and mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) were positively associated with IL-6. The positive associations between PAEs and CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significant in the high-molecular-weight phthalate (HMWP) exposure group, not the low-molecular-weight phthalate (LMWP) exposure group. Exposure to OCPs was positively associated with CRP, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-10. No significant association was found between PCBs and inflammatory markers. These findings demonstrate that exposure to EDCs is closely linked to dysregulated inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted in the future to get a comprehensive view of the associations between different EDCs and inflammation, and investigations on the underlying mechanisms are needed. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: X.

The adverse effects on biota induced by tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) have become a growing concern. Unfortunately, toxic mechanisms at the molecular level for OPFRs in organisms are still lacking. Herein, Escherichia coli (E.coli) was exposed to TCEP and TPHP for 24 and 48 h to reveal oxidative stress response and molecular toxicity mechanisms. The results indicated that promotion of ROS overload occurred at higher dosages groups. The levels of SOD and CAT were significantly elevated along with the increase of MDA attributed to lipid peroxidation. Additionally, apoptosis rates increased, accompanied by a decline in membrane potential and Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase contents, signifying that E. coli cytotoxicity induced by TCEP and TPHP was mediated by oxidative stress. Based on metabolomic analysis, different metabolic pathways were disrupted, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate metabolism, purine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, butanoate metabolism, alanine and aspartate metabolism. Most differentially expressed metabolites were downregulated, indicating an inhibitory effect on metabolic functions and key metabolic pathways.

Toxicity originates during the metabolization process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult) influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: M.S.

The 3D spheroids were repeatedly exposed to 25-, 50-, or 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA for 28 d. Compared with the PFOA groups, the HFPO-TA groups showed higher bioaccumulation potential, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP), albumin, and urea secretion. Transcriptome analysis identified 1603 and 772 differentially expressed genes in the 100-μM HFPO-TA- and PFOA-treated groups, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and inflammatory response were significantly altered. Exposure to 100-μM HFPO-TA increased triglyceride content but decreased total cholesterol content, while no changes were observed in the 100-μM PFOA-treated group. Total bile acids in the re-polarized 3D spheroids increased significantly after 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA treatment, which did not affect bile acid synthesis but inhibited the expression levels of Bsep and Mrp2 related to bile acid transport. Thus, HFPO-TA exhibited more serious hepatotoxicity than PFOA in 3D primary liver spheroids and may not be a safe alternative. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: J.

The complete mineralisation of aqueous PFAS by ultrasound (sonolysis) into harmless inorganics has been demonstrated in many studies. However, the range and interconnected nature of reaction parameters (frequency, power, temperature etc.), and variety of reaction metrics used, limits understanding of degradation mechanisms and parametric trends. This work summarises the state-of-the-art for PFAS sonolysis, considering reaction mechanisms, kinetics, intermediates, products, rate limiting steps, reactant and product measurement techniques, and effects of co-contaminants. The meta-analysis showed that mid-high frequency (100 – 1,000 kHz) sonolysis mechanisms are similar, regardless of reaction conditions, while the low frequency (20 – 100 kHz) mechanisms are specific to oxidative species added, less well understood, and generally slower than mid-high frequency mechanisms. Arguments suggest that PFAS degradation occurs via adsorption (not absorption) at the bubble interface, followed by headgroup cleavage. Further mechanistic steps toward mineralisation remain to be proven. For the first time, complete stoichiometric reaction equations are derived for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) sonolysis, which add H2 as a reaction product and consider CO an intermediate. Fluorinated intermediate products are derived for common, and more novel PFAS, and a naming system proposed for novel perfluoroether carboxylates. The meta-analysis also revealed the transition between pseudo first and zero order PFOA/S kinetics commonly occurs at 15 – 40 µM. Optimum values of; ultrasonic frequency (300 – 500 kHz), concentration (>15 – 40 μM), temperature (≈20 °C), and pH range (3.2 – 4) for rapid PFOX degradation are derived by evaluation of prior works, while optimum values for the dilution factor applied to PFAS containing firefighting foams and applied power require further work. Rate limiting steps are debated and F− is shown to be rate enhancing, while SO42− and CO2 by products are theorised to be rate limiting. Sonolysis was compared to other PFAS destructive technologies and shown to be the only treatment which fully mineralises PFAS, degrades different PFAS in order of decreasing hydrophobicity, is parametrically well studied, and has low-moderate energy requirements (several kWh g−1 PFAS). It is concluded that sonolysis of PFAS in environmental samples would be well incorporated within a treatment train for improved efficiency. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 22; Correspondence Address: M.J.

Here, we assess publication trends, sampling focus, and concentrations observed for a range of emerging contaminants (pharmaceutical and personal care products, pesticides, other endocrine disrupting chemicals, platinum group elements, and microplastics) in the GBA, via a systematic review of papers (n = 407) indexed in Science Direct, SpringerLink and Wiley Online databases. While emerging contaminants form the focus of increasing numbers of publications since 2006, they are understudied compared to more traditionally-measured contaminants (here, DDT and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs). BisphenolA was the most widely studied of the emerging contaminants (n = 41 studies) in the GBA, followed by macrolides (n = 32 studies). While multiple point measurements with high precision and low detection limits have been reported for various emerging contaminants, these have not been integrated for management purposes. A relatively high percentage of studies present data from single deployments (48% of studies, despite strong seasonality in the PRD system), data coverage is variable spatially, and reported contaminant concentrations vary significantly (over one to four orders of magnitude).

This systematic review study, using the Scopus da-tabase, provides an insightful understanding of the spatial distribution of scientific studies on MPs in freshwater conducted across the Asian region, utilized sampling methods, and a detailed assessment of the effects of MPs on different biotic components in freshwater ecosystems, with special focus on its potential risks on human health. The results of this review indicate that research on microplastics in Asia has gained attention since 2014, with a significant increase in the number of studies in 2018, and the number of scientific studies quadrupled in 2021 compared to 2018. Results indicated that despite a significant amount of research has been conducted in many Asian countries, they were not distributed evenly, as multiple studies selected specific rivers and lakes. Additionally, around two-thirds of all the papers focused their studies in China, followed by India and South Korea. It was also found that most of the studies focused primarily on reporting the occurrence levels of MPs in freshwater systems, such as water and sediments, and aquatic organisms, with a lack of studies investigating the human intake of MPs and their potential risks to human health. Notably, comparing the results is a challenge because diverse sampling, separation, and identification methods were applied to estimate MPs. This review study suggests that further research on the dynamics and transport of microplastics in biota and humans is needed, as Asia is a major consumer of seafood products and contributes significantly to the generation of plastic litter in the marine environment. Moreover, this review study revealed that only a few studies extended their discus-sions to policies and governance aspects of MPs. This implies the need for further research on policy and governance frameworks to address this emerging water pollutant more holistically. © 2022 by the authors.

Results showed exposure to HFPO-TA induced disadvantageous physiological changes in mice, including increases in liver weight, altered cell morphology, and inflammatory responses. Specifically, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA increased mitochondria number, relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and mRNA levels of mitochondrial genes encoded by mtDNA. Significant increases in TFAM mRNA and protein levels were also observed. Liver metabolome analysis also showed exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA further enhanced increases in metabolites and altered metabolic pathways that correlated with mitochondrial function, especially the production of ATP. HFPO-TA exposure increased protein expression of mitochondrial complex I-V, and the activities of key enzymes involved in TCA cycle (α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase). Furthermore, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA significantly up-regulating mRNA and protein levels of Opa1, Mfn1, Mfn2, Fis1, and Mff, but did not change Drp1.

We investigated whether exposure to DDT can exacerbate tau protein toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans using a transgenic strain that expresses human tau protein prone to aggregation by measuring changes in size, swim behavior, respiration, lifespan, learning, and metabolism. In addition, we examined the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau protein—as a marker of postmortem tau burden—and global metabolism in both a human population study and in C. elegans, using the same p-tau transgenic strain. From the human population study, plasma and CSFderived metabolic features associated with p-tau levels were related to drug, amino acid, fatty acid, and mitochondrial metabolism pathways. A total of five metabolites overlapped between plasma and C. elegans, and four between CSF and C. elegans. DDT exacerbated the inhibitory effect of p-tau protein on growth and basal respiration. In the presence of p-tau protein, DDT induced more curling and was associated with reduced levels of amino acids but increased levels of uric acid and adenosylselenohomocysteine. Our findings in C. elegans indicate that DDT exposure and p-tau aggregation both inhibit mitochondrial function and DDT exposure can exacerbate the mitochondrial inhibitory effects of p-tau aggregation. Further, biological pathways associated with exposure to DDT and p-tau protein appear to be conserved between species.  © The Author(s) 2022.

We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies comparing contemporary single- and dual-chamber ICD (VVI-/DDD-ICD) versus VDD-ICD were included. Restricted maximum likelihood method for random effect model and Mantel-Haenszel method for fixed effect model were used to estimate the effect size of new-onset AHREs, or SCAF detection in each group. Three prospective studies were identified and total of 991 participants were included. There were 330 (33.3%) in VDD-ICD and 661 (66.7%) in VVI-/DDD-ICD. Most (78%) participants were men. Median follow-up was from 365 days to 847 days. VDD-ICD has a higher likelihood of detecting AHREs or SCAF as compared to VVI-/DDD-ICD [(OR random effect : 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.8; p =.018); I-squared = 67.8%, p =.019]. This difference was more apparently seen in the comparison between VDD-ICD and VVI-ICD [(OR random effect: 3.8; 95% CI: 2.1, 6.6, p <.001), I-squared = 0.0%, p =.518]. The result is same as fixed effect. Rate of AHREs detection observed in VDD-ICD was not statistically different when compared to the only group with DDD-ICD from SENSE trial. In conclusion, this meta-analysis reveals that the use of floating atrial sensing dipole in VDD-ICD increases the detection of new-onset AHREs or SCAF when compared to VVI-ICD, with similar atrial sensing performance to DDD-ICD. © 2022 The Authors.

Reperfusion may be a necessary condition for positive effects of neuroprotective treatments. This systematic review provides an overview of efficacy of neuroprotective agents in combination with reperfusion therapy in AIS. Methods: A literature search was performed on the following databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare. All databases were searched up to September 23rd 2021. All randomized controlled trials in which patients were treated with neuroprotective strategies within 12 h of stroke onset in combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular therapy (EVT), or both were included. Results: We screened 1,764 titles/abstracts and included 30 full reports of unique studies with a total of 16,160 patients. In 15 studies neuroprotectants were tested for clinical efficacy, where all patients had to receive reperfusion therapies, either IVT and/or EVT. Heterogeneity in reported outcome measures was observed. Treatment was associated with improved clinical outcome for: 1) uric acid in patients treated with EVT and IVT, 2) nerinetide in patients who underwent EVT without IVT, 3) imatinib in stroke patients treated with IVT with or without EVT, 4) remote ischemic perconditioning and IVT, and 5) high-flow normobaric oxygen treatment after EVT, with or without IVT. Conclusion: Studies specifically testing effects of neuroprotective agents in addition to IVT and/or EVT are scarce. Future neuroprotection studies should report standardized functional outcome measures and combine neuroprotective agents with reperfusion therapies in AIS or aim to include prespecified subgroup analyses for treatment with IVT and/or EVT.

Significant progress has been made to cure these infections, such as discovering antiparasitic drugs, developing new formulation strategies, site-directed drug delivery, chemotherapy, etc. Synthetic drugs are peri-lous and have various side effects, leading to the development of drug resistance and loss of health. Herbal medicines are economical and generally free from potential side effects; therefore, they are acclaiming recognition. However, it is difficult to produce antiparasitic vaccines; major efforts have been made and still, there are no licensed vaccines currently available to control human parasitic ailments. This systematic review assesses various techniques for the treatment of parasitic infections. Moreover, the advancements and challenges involved in establishing novel trends in the development of more effective drug delivery systems are also investigated. Over the years, the inci-dences of several infectious ailments in humans have enhanced and it is estimated to further increase in the future. Over thirty new infective agents have been identified globally in the last 30 years; approximately 60 % of them are from zoonotic sources. Efficient drug delivery plays a key role in treating parasitic infections. The main goal of the modern antiparasitic drug delivery system is to minimize the potential side effects and deliver the drug directly to the target pathogens.

Most chemical concentrations were consistent with background levels [e.g., median (range) cord blood lead: 1.1 (0–9.4) μg/dL]. BKMR suggested linear associations and no interactions between chemicals. The overall mixture was positively associated with Conners’ Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) and BASC-2 Self Report of Personality (SRP) anxiety and depressive symptoms, and negatively with somatic symptoms. Prenatal lead was positively associated with adolescent anxiety symptoms [1.56 (95% CI: 0.50, 2.61) BASC-2 SRP Anxiety score increase per doubling lead]. For CRPS and BASC-2 SRP, a doubling of cord blood manganese was positively associated with internalizing symptoms for girls [e.g., 3.26 (95% CI: 0.27, 6.25) BASC-2 SRP Depression score increase], but not boys. Organochlorine exposures were not adversely associated with internalizing symptoms. Discussion: Low-level prenatal lead exposure was positively associated with adolescent anxiety symptoms, and prenatal manganese exposure was positively associated with internalizing symptoms for girls from mid-childhood through adolescence. In utero neurotoxicant metal exposures may contribute to the emergence of anxiety and depression. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: L.B.

There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: N.M.

PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based & no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I2 = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: C.

These enzymes have a broad substrate range and a robust oxidizing ability. Moreover, using mediators or co-oxidants makes it possible to increase their catalytic activity and extend their substrate scope to more resistant chemical structures. Background: Fungal laccases and ligninolytic peroxidases, mainly lignin and manganese peroxidases, are the privileged oxidoreductases for bioremediation processes. Nonetheless, an increasing diversity of laccases and peroxidase-type enzymes has been proposed for environmental technologies. Objective: This article aims to provide an overview of these enzymes and compare their applicability in the degradation of organic pollutants. Methods: Fundamental properties of the proteins are covered and applications towards polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides are specially focused. Results: Laccases are multicopper oxidases initially studied for applications in the pulp and paper in-dustry but able to oxidize a variety of environmentally concerning compounds. Relying on O2, laccases do not require peroxides nor auxiliary agents, like Mn2+, although suitable redox mediators are needed to attack the more recalcitrant pollutants (e.g., PAHs). True and pseudo-peroxidases use a stronger oxi-dant (H2O2) and the redox chemistry at the heme site generates high potential species that allow the oxidation of dyes and some pesticides. Conclusion: Lately, research efforts have been directed to enzyme discovery, testing with micropollu-tants, and improving biocatalysts’ stability by immobilization and protein engineering. Further under-standing of the effects of natural media components and solvents on the enzymes might lead to compet-itive enzymatic treatments of highly toxic media. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: R.L.

Methods: The Smith & Nephew InterTan IDL was compared with SL CMN group consisting of the Stryker Gamma-3 (G3) and Synthes Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) CMN. A multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies assessing the clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and perioperative parameters of InterTan versus G3 or PFNA CMN in patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were extracted and analysed. Results: 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 2643 patients. InterTan was associated with lower complication rates in terms of all-cause revisions (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.51; p < 0.001), cut-outs (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17–0.51; p < 0.001), medial or lateral screw migration (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.65; p = 0.008) as well as persistent hip and thigh pain (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.90; p = 0.008). In terms of perioperative parameters, InterTan is associated with longer operative times (MD 5.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.37–10.78 minutes, p = 0.04) and fluoroscopy times (MD 38.89 seconds, 95% CI, 15.88–61.91 seconds; p < 0.001).

Only meta-analyses and review articles were included, as they provide more extensive evidence compared to individual studies. The collected evidence indicated that lead (Pb), phthalates and bisphenol A (BPA) are moderately to highly associated with ADHD. Limited evidence exists for an association between ADHD and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), flame retardants, mercury (Hg), and pesticides. The evidence of association between ADHD and cadmium (Cd) and per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs) based on the identified reviews was low but justified further research.

The acquired DDE may occur as a result of a wide range of acquired etiological factors and his prevalence of this pathology may reach up to 89.9%. The main objective of this research was to identify and analyze, in current literature, the factors related to acquired DDE, in order to propose a general theory about the mechanisms involved. Methods: The search of the primary literature was conducted until [December 31, 2021]. Our search strategy uses the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and was structured around 3 terms [“Development,” “Defect,” and “Enamel”]. To be included, references had to be primary studies, written in English. Exclusion criteria were reviews, in vitro, animal, genetic or archeology studies, and studies focused on clinical management of DDE. One hundred and twenty three articles were included in this scoping review: 4 Randomized clinical trials, 1 letter, 5 cases reports, 2 fundamentals studies, and 111 observational studies (33 Cross-sectional studies, 68 Cohort study and 10 Case-control study). The quality of evidence was assessed using the PEDro scale for clinical trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies, and a published tool to assess the quality of case reports and case series. Results: A scoping review of the literature identified 114 factors potentially involved in acquired DDE. The most frequently encountered pathologies are those causing a disorder of calcium homeostasis or a perturbation of the ARNT pathway in mother or child. The link between the ARNT pathway and metabolism deficiency in uncertain and needs to be defined. Also, the implication of this mechanism in tissue impairment is still unclear and needs to be explored. Conclusions: By identifying and grouping the risk factors cited in the literature, this taxonomy and the hypotheses related to the mechanism allow health practitioners to adopt behaviors that limit the risk of developing aDDE and to set up a prevention of dental pathology. In addition, by reviewing the current literature, this work provides guidance for basic research, clinical studies, and literature searches.

Studies were included when the patients were affected by any PFDs and cells were isolated, cultured, and characterized as SC. The study protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42020216551). A total of 11 prospective clinical studies were included in the final assessment, specifically 7 single-arm studies dealing with SC therapy for stress urinary incontinence and 4 with anal incontinence. Among the latter, there were two prospective, single-arm studies and two randomized controlled trials. No papers concerning the use of SC for prolapse repair were retrieved. Due to the great heterogeneity, data pooling was not possible. Stem cell injection resulted in a safe procedure, with few mild adverse side effects, mostly related to harvesting sites.

Plastics have become part of our daily life due to their many applications and uses. However, inappropriately managed plastic waste has raised concern regarding their ecotoxicological and human health risks in the long term. Due to the non-biodegradable nature of plastics, their waste may take several thousands of years to partially degrade in natural environments. Plastic fragments/particles can be very minute in size and are mistaken easily for prey or food by aquatic organisms (e.g., invertebrates, fishes). The surface properties of plastic particles, including large surface area, functional groups, surface topography, point zero charge, influence the sorption of various contaminants, including heavy metals, oil spills, PAHs, PCBs and DDT. Despite the fact that the number of studies on the biological effects of plastic particles on biota and humans has been increasing in recent years, studies on mixtures of plastics and other chemical contaminants in the aquatic environment are still limited. This review aims to gather information about the main characteristics of plastic particles that allow different types of contaminants to adsorb on their surfaces, the consequences of this adsorption, and the interactions of plastic particles with aquatic biota. Additionally, some missing links and potential solutions are presented to boost more research on this topic and achieve a holistic view on the effects of micro-and nanoplastics to biological systems in aquatic environments. It is urgent to implement measures to deal with plastic pollution that include improving waste management, monitoring key plastic particles, their hotspots, and developing their assessment techniques, using alternative products, determining concentrations of micro-and nanoplastics and the contaminants in freshwater and marine food-species consumed by humans, applying clean-up and remediation strategies, and biodegradation strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

These agents include air, gas (sulfur hexafluoride [SF6], hexafluoroethane [C2F6], and perfluoropropane [C3F8]), and silicone oil. The optimal tamponade agent is uncertain, and we aimed to review the effect of tamponade choice on hole closure and visual outcomes. Clinical relevance: Although most surgeons initially chose to use long-acting gas (C3F8), there has been a gradual change in practice to the increasing use of the medium- (C2F6) and short-acting gases (SF6) or even air. However, there is no consensus regarding their relative efficacies. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies comparing different tamponade agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy and ILM peeling for primary idiopathic macular holes. For RCTs, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, whereas for nonrandomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used. Results: Thirteen publications, including 2 RCTs, were identified. Overall, there was no significant difference in the anatomic closure rates between studies using SF6 compared with either C3F8 or C2F6 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51–1.08). A subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher closure rate using SF6 (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.30–0.79) in patients without postoperative posturing but not in those who were advised to posture facedown. The visual outcomes and adverse events were not significantly different. The comparisons of anatomic closure rates of patients treated with gas tamponade vs. silicone oil and with air vs. SF6 showed no significant differences. The included studies had a number of methodological limitations and heterogeneities, making conclusions imprecise, with low or very low certainty by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Conclusion: The current evidence base for tamponade selection with vitrectomy and ILM peeling for full-thickness macular hole has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection. © 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: D.H.

However, traditional assessment heavily relies on laboratory bioassays, which may cause uncertainty due to inevitable laboratory-related artifact. A self-designed in-situ bioassay system was successfully applied to simultaneously evaluate water and sediment toxicity by co-exposure of two native species, Chinese rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) in Tai Lake Basin, China. In-situ exposure caused pronouncedly lethal and sublethal effects (i.e., metabolic and oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity) on both fish and clams. Meanwhile, multi-media distribution of organic contaminants in water-sediment-biota system was analyzed. Besides hydrophobicity, metabolism was recognized as an influential factor on phase distribution of contaminants in water-fish and sediment-clam systems. Traditional hazard quotient (HQ) method based on environmental concentrations of 98 contaminants showed bias in risk assessment. Instead, a weight of evidence method by integrating three lines of evidence, including in-situ survival, enhanced integrated biomarker response values and environmental concentrations, successfully differentiate high- and moderate-risk sites in the shallow lakes.

This highlights the need for understanding the impact of such application on the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in poultry gut and devising means to circumvent the potential resistome expansion. Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) are potential natural alternative to antibiotic to improve animal health and performance, supposedly via positively affecting the gut microbial ecosystem, but there is little systematic information available. In this time-course study, we applied a shotgun meta-transcriptomics approach to investigate the impact of a PFA product as well as the commonly used antibiotic, zinc bacitracin either at AGP concentration or therapeutic concentration on the gut microbiome and resistome of broiler chickens raised for 35 days. Over the course of the trial, PFA treatments increased the abundance of Firmicutes such as Lactobacillus and resulted in a lower abundance of Escherichia, while the latter group increased significantly in the feces of chickens that received either AGP or AB doses of bacitracin. Tetracycline resistance and aminoglycoside resistance were the predominant antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) classes found, regardless of the treatment. PFA application resulted in a decrease in abundance of ARGs compared to those in the control group and other antibiotic treatment groups. In summary, the findings from this study demonstrate the potential of phytogenic feed additives could be an alternative to antibiotics in poultry farming, with the added benefit of counteracting antimicrobial resistance development.

However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil- and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 29; Correspondence Address: B.

The microbial community present at such sites has the potential to remediate these contaminants. The present study highlights the metabolic potential of the resident bacterial community of PAHs and PCB contaminated soil nearby Bhilai steel plant, Chhattisgarh (India). The GC-MS/MS analysis of soil samples MGB-2 (sludge) and MGB-3 (dry soil) resulted in identification of different classes of POPs including PAHs {benzo[a]anthracene (nd; 17.69%), fluorene (15.89%, nd), pyrene (nd; 18.7%), benzo(b)fluoranthene (3.03%, nd), benzo(k) fluoranthene (11.29%; nd), perylene (5.23%; nd)} and PCBs (PCB-15, PCB-95, and PCB-136). Whole-genome metagenomic analysis by Oxford Nanopore GridION Technology revealed predominance of domain bacteria (97.4%; 97.5%) followed by eukaryote (1.4%; 1.5%), archaea (1.2%; 0.9%) and virus (0.02%; 0.04%) in MGB-2 and MGB-3 respectively. Proteobacteria (44.3%; 50.0%) to be the prominent phylum followed by Actinobacteria (22.1%; 19.5%) in MBG-2 and MBG-3, respectively. However, Eukaryota microbial communities showed a predominance of phylum Ascomycota (20.5%; 23.6%), Streptophyta (18.5%, 17.0%) and unclassified (derived from Eukaryota) (12.1%; 12.2%) in MGB-2 and MGB-3. The sample MGB-3 was richer in macronutrients (C, N, P), supporting high microbial diversity than MGB-2. The presence of reads for biphenyl degradation, dioxin degradation, PAH degradation pathways can be further correlated with the presence of PCB and PAH as detected in the MGB-2 and MGB-3 samples. Further, taxonomic vis-à-vis functional analysis identified Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, Mycobacterium, and Rhodopseudomonas as the keystone degrader of PAH and PCB. Overall, our results revealed the importance of metagenomic and physicochemical analysis of the contaminated site, which improves the understanding of metabolic potential and adaptation of bacteria growing under POP contaminated environments. © 2022 Sandhu et al.

Many vertebrate species feed on crops, which has caused an increase in human-wildlife conflicts in croplands. Crop-feeding damages the economy of local communities and causes retaliation against the responsible vertebrates in several forms, including lethal practices such as hunting and poisoning. Lethal control may cause the local extirpation of some species, affecting ecological processes and patterns. Therefore, it is necessary to find non-lethal alternatives that can protect both local economies and wildlife. Research has been conducted in Africa and Asia, focusing on elephants and primates, and the effectiveness of some non-lethal alternatives, such as chili-based repellents and beehives, is being investigated. However, there has been very little research on this topic in Central and South America. The goal of this review is to assess the current knowledge on crop damage by vertebrates in Central and South America and indicate future research directions. Survey methodology: We reviewed the available scientific literature reporting crop damage by vertebrates in Central and South America, and the Caribbean, published between 1980 and 2020, through systematic searches on Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We analyzed the temporal and geographical distributions of the studies, the crops and vertebrate species these studies considered, the crop protection techniques used, and their effectiveness. Results: We retrieved only 113 studies on crop damage by vertebrates in Latin America, but there was an increasing trend in the number of studies published over time. Most of the studies were conducted in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Costa Rica. Four orders of mammals (Rodentia, Carnivora, Artiodactyla, and Primates) and four orders of birds (Passeriformes, Columbiformes, Psittaciformes, and Anseriformes) were the most common groups of crop-feeding vertebrates. The most prominent crop was corn, which was featured in 49% of the studies. Other notable crops include rice, sorghum, and sugarcane. The most reported method for protecting crops was lethal control through hunting or poisoning. Non-lethal techniques were found to be less prevalent. Less than half of the studies that mentioned the use of protection techniques indicated their effectiveness, and only 10 studies evaluated it by performing scientific experiments and reporting their results. Conclusions: Central and South America is still underrepresented in research on vertebrate crop-feeding. There is a need for experimentation-based robust research to find crop protection techniques that minimize harm to vertebrates while effectively reducing damage to crops. While this is being studied, habitat loss and fragmentation need to be halted to prevent the native vertebrates from turning to crops for food.

Tons and tons of wastewater with hazardous pollutants are getting discharged into the clean water bodies every day. In this regard, photocatalytic environmental remediation using nanotechnology such as the use of organic, metal and non-metal based semiconductor photocatalysts for photodegradation of pollutants has gained enormous attention in the past few decades. This review is focused particularly on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) which is a cheap, metal-free, polymeric photoactive compound and it is used as a potential photocatalyst in wastewater treatment. Though, pristine g-C3N4 is a good photocatalyst, it has certain drawbacks such as poor visible light absorption capacity, quicker recombination of photoelectrons and holes, delayed mass and charge transfer, etc. As a result, the pristine g-C3N4 catalyst is modified into novel 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D morphologies such as nano-quantum dots, nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires, nanosheets, nanoflakes, nanospheres, nanoshells, etc. It was also tailored into novel composites along with various compounds through doping, metal deposition, heterojunction formation, etc., to enhance the photocatalytic property of pure g-C3N4. The modified catalysts showed promising photocatalytic performance such as degradation of majority of pollutants in the environment. It also showed excellent results in the removal or reduction of heavy metals. This review provides a detailed record of g-C3N4 and its diverse photocatalytic applications in the past years and it provides knowledge for the development of such similar novel compounds in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 69; Correspondence Address: S.

Modification of maternal metabolism by environmental exposure may be an important pathway for these impacts. However, there is limited evidence regarding exposure to a wide array of chemicals and the metabolome during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between the urinary exposome and metabolome during pregnancy. METHODS: Urine samples were collected in the first and third trimesters from 1,024 pregnant women recruited in prenatal clinics in Jiangsu Province, China. The exposome was analyzed using the first trimester sample with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The metabolome was analyzed using the third trimester sample with UHPLC-HRMS. We evaluated associations between each of 106 exposures in the first trimester with 139 metabolites in the third trimester. RESULTS: We identified 1,245 significant associations (p < 3:39 × 10−6, Bonferroni correction) between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Among elements, the largest number of the significant metabolic associations were observed for magnesium, and among organic compounds, for 4-tert-octylphenol. We used exposome–metabolome associations to explore mechanisms underlying published associations between prenatal chemical exposures and offspring health outcomes. This integration of the literature with our results suggests that reported associations between 10 analytes and birth weight, gestational age, fat deposition, neurobehavioral development, immunological disorders, and hypertension may be partially mediated by metabolites associated with these exposures. DISCUSSION: This high-dimensional analysis of the urinary exposome and metabolome identified many associations between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Integration of these associations with the literature on health outcomes of exposure suggests that environmental modulation of the maternal metabolome may play a role in the association between prenatal exposure on pregnancy and child health outcomes. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

However, the effects of moderate exposure to POPs on task-based inhibitory control performance, related brain function, and ADHD-related symptoms remain unknown, limiting our ability to develop interventions targeting the neural impact of common levels of exposure. Objectives: The goal of this study was to examine the association between prenatal POP exposure and inhibitory control performance, neural correlates of inhibitory control and ADHD-related symptoms. Methods: Prospective data was gathered in an observational study of Canadian mother-child dyads, with moderate exposure to POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), as part of the GESTation and the Environment (GESTE) cohort in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. The sample included 87 eligible children, 46 with maternal plasma samples, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of Simon task performance at 9–11 years, and parental report of clinical symptoms via the Behavioral Assessment System for Children 3 (BASC-3). Simon task performance was probed via drift diffusion modeling, and parameter estimates were related to POP exposure. Simon task-based fMRI data was modeled to examine the difference in incongruent vs congruent trials in regions of interest (ROIs) identified by meta analysis. Results: Of the 46 participants with complete data, 29 were male, and mean age was 10.42 ± 0.55 years. Increased POP exposure was associated with reduced accuracy (e.g. PCB molar sum rate ratio = 0.95; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]), drift rate (e.g. for PCB molar sum β = −0.42; 95% CI [-0.77, −0.07]), and task-related brain activity (e.g. in inferior frontal cortex for PCB molar sum β = −0.35; 95% CI [-0.69, −0.02]), and increased ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity PCB molar sum β = 2.35; 95%CI [0.17, 4.53]), supporting the possibility that prenatal exposure to POPs is a modifiable risk for ADHD phenotypes. Discussion: We showed that exposure to POPs is related to task-based changes in neural activity in brain regions important for inhibitory control, suggesting a biological mechanism underlying previously documented associations between POPs and neurobehavioral deficits found in ADHD phenotypes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: L.

However, pests have not been completely mitigated with the increased use of insecticides. Instead, many side effects have arisen, especially the ‘3Rs’ (resistance, resurgence, and residue). The brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens, is one of the most threatening rice pests. The main insecticides for controlling N. lugens belong to organochlorine, organophosphorus, carbamate, neonicotinoid and pyrethroid groups. However, metabolic enzymes, including cytochrome P450s, esterases, glutathione-S-transferases, and ATP-binding cassette transporters, effectively promote the detoxification of insecticides. Besides, mutations of neurological target sites, such as acetylcholinesterase, nicotinic acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor, and ryanodine receptor, result in insensitivity to insecticides. Here, we review the physiological metabolic resistance in N. lugens under insecticide stress to provide a theoretical basis for identifying and developing more effective and harmless insecticides. © 2022, King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: B.

Here, we established a large dataset for the biomonitoring of seven representative congeners of PFAS by examining data from 2325 publications. Global exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the highest, followed by perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Spatiotemporal exposure to PFAS varied considerably, with daily intake estimated in the range of 0.01-1.7 ng/kg/day. Moreover, decreasing trends in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA exposure were noted in most regions of the world over the past two decades, but such trends were not observed for other PFAS with long carbon chains, especially in East Asia. Furthermore, we estimated that human exposure to PFOA contributed to approximately 461,635 (95% confidence interval: 57,418 to 854,645) cases per year of LBW during the past two decades, predominantly from Asian regions. Although our estimation may be constrained by uncertainties from the dose-response curve and data availability, this study has unveiled that PFAS might be a contributor to global LBW prevalence during 2000-2019, supporting continuous actions to mitigate PFAS contamination. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 19; Correspondence Address: Z.

This paper provides a systematic review of the research advances in the novel environmentally friendly suppressant, C6F12O. Considering the principle of screening fire suppressants, the physical and chemical properties of C6F12O are presented first. Specifically, research on the measurement of the thermodynamic parameters, toxicity, corrosion, environmental compatibility and dispersion characteristics are summarized, revealing that the poor dispersibility, corrosion of the hydrolysates (perfluoropropionic acid), corrosion and toxicity of thermal breakdown products such as HF and COF2 and environmentally unfriendly products such as perfluorocarbons should be paid more attention. Three main synthesis routes of C6F12O are also introduced in view of its promising prospects for application. Furthermore, the fire extinguishing efficiency of C6F12O has been fully investigated in both a laboratory burner scale and full-scale fire extinguishing experiment, the results of which show that the minimum extinguishing volume concentration of C6F12O is lower than HFCs, but the mass concentration is much higher. Although C6F12O has shown satisfactory fire extinguishing performance in various fire protection scenarios, fire enhancement phenomenon and the large production of HF have been observed during fire extinguishment. Finally, the fire extinguishing mechanism of C6F12O has been discussed. The flame suppression effect of C6F12O, combustion enhancement phenomenon and the influence of water in the reaction zone have been revealed. This review fully evaluates C6F12O, in hope that it will provide a reference for follow-up research and the development of a halon replacement. © 2022 by the authors.

Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) increased by an average of 6.0 ± 1.6 ng/L from the influents to the effluents of WWTPs, but perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS) did not significantly change, indicating sorption to sludge is offset by biotransformation of precursor compounds. The occurrence of individual PFAS may vary temporally; for example, perfluoropentanoic acid correlated weakly with seasonal temperatures at a site in Virginia. Wastewater effluent PFOA concentrations decreased at a site in Nevada from 2012 to February 2020 but appeared to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic.

S2-17, which could completely degrade an emerging organic pollutant, benzophenone-3 (BP-3), was isolated from contaminated sediment through an enrichment procedure, and its BP-3 catabolic pathway and genes were identified through metabolic intermediate and transcriptomic analyses and biochemical and genetic studies. Metabolic intermediate analysis suggested that strain S2-17 may degrade BP-3 using a catabolic pathway progressing via the intermediates BP-1, 2,4,5-trihydroxy-benzophenone, 3-hydroxy-4-benzoyl-2,4-hexadienedioic acid, 4-benzoyl-3-oxoadipic acid, 3-oxoadipic acid, and benzoic acid. A putative BP-3 catabolic gene cluster including cytochrome P450, flavin-dependent oxidoreductase, hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase, maleylacetate reductase, and α/β hydrolase genes was identified through genomic and transcriptomic analyses. Genes encoding the cytochrome P450 complex that demethylates BP-3 to BP-1 were functionally verified through protein expression, and the functions of the other genes were also verified through knockout mutant construction and intermediate analysis. This study suggested that strain S2-17 might have acquired the ability to catabolize BP-3 by recruiting the cytochrome P450 complex and α/β hydrolase, which hydrolyzes 4-benzoyl-3-oxoadipic acid to benzoic acid and 3-oxoadipic acid, genes, providing insights into the recruitment of genes of for the catabolism of emerging organic pollutants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: C.O.

WHO classified scabies as a neglected tropical disease. The prevalence of scabies is high in certain countries ranging from 32.1% to 74%, especially in crowded conditions such as prisons, boarding schools, and orphanages. Indonesia is one of the most heavily affected countries worldwide. Scabies might cause great impact on patients, which includes decreased concentration and academic achievement at school, social stigma, sleep disturbances, and decreased economic productivity in community. Management of scabies with anti-scabies needs to be carried out appropriately, accompanied with treatment for all contacts. Mass treatment with permethrin cream or ivermectin can be given directly to patients. Prevention is conducted by providing medical treatment and breaking the chain of transmission. Source elimination and disinfection of fomites is very important. Participation of non-medical personnel such as teachers, cadres, and parents together with the local health workers (primary health care) is highly recommended. Using checklists or application can aid non-medical personnel to determine suspected cases, thus contributing to scabies elimination. Cooperation between patients, patient's family, health workers and other non-medical personnel will greatly reduce the prevalence of scabies and ultimately improve patient's quality of life.

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings.  © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.

The reconstruction of a six-loci gene tree (ITS, LSU, SSU, RPB1 and RPB2, and TEF1) using multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) analyses of the strain FJII-L10-SW-P1 supported a close relationship to other known Parengyodontium album subclade 3 isolates while being phylogenetically distinct from subclade 1 strains. The zig-zag rachides morphology of the conidiogenous cells and spindle-shaped conidia were the distinct morphological characteristics of the P. album subclade 3 strains. The MLST data and morphological analysis supported the conclusion that the P. album subclade 3 strains could be classified as a new species of the genus Parengyodontium and placed in the family Cordycipitaceae. The name Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the strain, with FJII-L10-SW-P1 as the holotype. The genome of the FJII-L10-SW-P1 strain was sequenced, annotated, and the secondary metabolite clusters were identified. Genes predicted to be responsible for biofilm formation and adhesion to surfaces were identified. Homology-based assignment of gene ontologies to the predicted proteome of P. torokii revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for synthesizing several metabolic compounds, including a cytochalasin that was also verified using traditional metabolomic analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

Regarding the complications of PFAs, few studies have investigated periprosthetic fractures. The purpose of this literature review was to highlight a previously overlooked complication of primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint. Methods: Three literature databases were searched for studies published between 2000 to 2020 using relevant keywords. A total of 4,942 articles were originally identified. After excluding duplicates and analysing the titles and abstracts, 20 studies were considered. From these, data regarding the number of cases, clinical outcomes and complications were extracted. Results: Among the 20 selected articles, only one described periprosthetic fractures as a complication of PFAs. Herein, we also report an illustrative case of an unknown fracture complication. No cases in the literature were found that described the type of complications experienced by our patient during the postoperative period. Conclusions: This review confirms the lack of data about clinical outcomes and fracture complications of PFAs. In primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint, patient selection and close consideration of demographic factors (such as BMI and age) and intraoperative factors (such as patellar thickness and size of the trochlear component) play a key role in optimising pre-operative planning to avoid intraoperative periprosthetic fractures. © The Author(s) 2022.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: G.

Postoperative anemia after fracture tends to cause ischemia, hypoxia in cells, tissues and organs, increasing the rate of blood transfusion, risk of infection, disability and mortality. Meanwhile, traditional Chinese medicine is widely used in the treatment of anemia for activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis.Methods:This study is a prospective, outcome assessor-, and data analyst-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. The objective of this proposed study was to investigate whether Shengyu Decoction could improve the symptoms of anemia after proximal femoral nail antirotation in elderly ITF patients. After qualifying for screening, patients will be randomized into 2 groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Hemoglobin concentration, HBL, and HHS score are outcome measurements. The other outcomes also included time to get out of bed, discharge to home, 30-day readmission rates, and mortality.Discussion:ITF is commonly occurring in senior citizens, and those who are senior in age generally suffer 1 or more basic diseases, whose nutritional status is already poor. Trauma and surgical stimulation not only aggravate the existing disease or induce corresponding cardiovascular complications, but also worsen the nutritional status, which can easily cause postoperative anemia in patients. Because of the limited clinical modalities available for the treatment of postoperative anemia after fracture surgery, and most of them have various side effects that are not easily tolerated by the elderly. Therefore, from a traditional Chinese medicine perspective, we proposed a protocol using mild Chinese herbal decoction to treat postoperative anemia in ITF.Registration number: OSF Registration number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/JQ6ZF. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Only eight out of 30 malaria mosquito vectors (Anopheles species) have been examined for insecticide resistance in Iran. This study aimed to review articles related to the incremental trend in insecticide resistance and their mechanisms among anopheline malaria vectors in Iran. Methods: A literature review was conducted based on such search engines as Iran doc, Web of Science, SID, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar websites using the following keywords: “Anopheles,” “Malaria,” “Resistance,” “Vectors,” “Insecticide Resistance,” and “Iran” for data collection. Published papers in English or Persian covering 1980 to 2020 were reviewed. Results: A total of 1125 articles were screened, only 16 of which were filtered to be pertinent in this review. While most of the mosquito vectors of malaria, such as Anopheles stephensi, were resistant to DDT, dieldrin, malathion, and becoming less susceptible to deltamethrin and other synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, few like Anopheles fluviatilis s. l. were susceptible to all insecticides. A disseminating trend in insecticide resistance among different anopheline mosquito vector species was evident. Metabolic and insecticide target-site resistance mechanisms were involved with organochlorines and pyrethroids, respectively. Conclusions: Insecticide resistance is becoming a severe scourge to the effectiveness of vector-borne disease management measures. This event is especially critical in developing and marginalized communities that applied chemical-based vector elimination programs for malaria; therefore, it is crucial to monitor insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Iran using biochemical and molecular tools. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: M.D. Moemenbellah-Fard; Research Center for Health Sciences, Institute of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; email: momenbf@sums.ac.ir",10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08830,Anophelinae;Carbamate;Knock-down resistance;Organophosphate;Pyrethrum;Culicidae;Iran;Malaria;Insecticides,NA,,monitoring of synthetic insecticides resistance and mechanisms among malaria vector mosquitoes in iran a systematic review

Microvascular decompression (MVD) with internal neurolysis (IN) is an alternative treatment that might benefit patients but has limited understanding. We performed a systematic review of IN for the treatment of TN. Methods: Studies from 2000 to 2021 that had assessed IN for TN were aggregated and independently reviewed. Results: A total of 520 patients in 12 studies were identified, with 384 who had undergone IN (mean age, 53.8 years; range, 46–61.4 years; mean follow-up, 36.5 months). Preoperative symptoms had been present for ∼55.0 months before treatment, and pain was predominantly in V2 and V3 (26.8%), followed by other distributions. Of the patients, 83.7% (range, 72%–93.8%) had had an excellent to good outcome (Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score [BNI-PS], I–II). The pain outcomes at 1 year were excellent for 58%–78.4%, good or better for 77%–93.75%, and fair or better for 80%–93.75% of the patients. On average, facial numbness after IN was experienced by 96% of the patients. However, at follow-up, facial numbness remained in only 1.75%–10%. Most of the remaining numbness was not significantly distressing to the patients. Subgroup comparisons of IN versus recurrent MVD, IN versus radiofrequency ablation, the effects of IN in the absence of vascular compression, and IN with and without MVD were also evaluated.

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers underlying the association between serum PFAS and fetal growth using high-resolution metabolomics in a cohort of pregnant African American women in the Atlanta area, Georgia. Methods: Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measurements and untargeted serum metabolomics profiling were conducted in 313 pregnant African American women at 8–14 weeks gestation. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the associations of PFAS with birth weight and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. A high-resolution metabolomics workflow including metabolome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis, and chemical annotation and confirmation with a meet-in-the-middle approach was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers of the PFAS-fetal growth relationship. Results: Each log2-unit increase in serum PFNA concentration was significantly associated with higher odds of SGA birth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 1.63); similar but borderline significant associations were found in PFOA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.94, 1.49) with SGA. Among 25,516 metabolic features extracted from the serum samples, we successfully annotated and confirmed 10 overlapping metabolites associated with both PFAS and fetal growth endpoints, including glycine, taurine, uric acid, ferulic acid, 2-hexyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, unsaturated fatty acid C18:1, androgenic hormone conjugate, parent bile acid, and bile acid-glycine conjugate. Also, we identified 21 overlapping metabolic pathways from pathway enrichment analyses. These overlapping metabolites and pathways were closely related to amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism perturbations. Conclusion: In this cohort of pregnant African American women, higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were associated with reduced fetal growth. Perturbations of biological pathways involved in amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism were associated with PFAS exposures and reduced fetal growth, and uric acid was shown to be a potential intermediate biomarker. Our results provide opportunities for future studies to develop early detection and intervention for PFAS-induced fetal growth restriction. © 2021","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 66; Correspondence Address: D.

These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks. Moreover, advanced computational and prediction tools, further validation of metabolic biomarkers, as well as systematic and integrative investigations are also needed in order to reliably identify novel biomarkers and elucidate toxicity mechanisms, and to further utilize exposome and metabolome profiling in public health and safety management. © 2021","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 71; Correspondence Address: Y.

Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut–brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota–gut–brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the effect of garlic (Allium sativum L), one of such PFAs on the internal egg quality indices of laying hens is less clear. As a result, this meta-analysis investigated the impact of garlic supplementation on egg yolk weight (EYW) and egg yolk cholesterol (EYC) content in laying hens. A search carried out in three online databases yielded five hundred and ten studies of which fifteen passed the predefined selection conditions for the meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria were information on moderator variables (hen’s age, layer strains, presentation form, treatment duration, inclusion level, and the number of hens used for the study), and outcome measures (EYW and EYC) with their corresponding measures of variance. All analyses were performed in OpenMEE software. Results indicate that addition of garlic to layer diets increased EYW by 0.063 g [95% confidence interval (CI) = 95% CI: -0.051, 0.176] compared to zero, though the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, garlic supplementation reduced EYC concentrations by 0.641 mg/g yolk (95% CI: -0.059, -0.424) in comparison with controls, taking publication bias and heterogeneity into consideration. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that modifiers had impact on the results and conclusion.

Both interventions use insecticides to kill mosquitoes that bite and rest indoors. Adding IRS to ITNs may improve malaria control simply because two interventions can be better than one. Furthermore, IRS may improve malaria control where ITNs are failing due to insecticide resistance. Pyrethroid insecticides are the predominant class of insecticide used for ITNs, as they are more safe than other insecticide classes when in prolonged contact with human skin. While many mosquito populations have developed some resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, a wider range of insecticides can be used for IRS. This review is an update of the previous Cochrane 2019 edition. Objectives: To summarize the effect on malaria of additionally implementing IRS, using non-pyrethroid-like or pyrethroid-like insecticides, in communities currently using ITNs. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; and five other databases for records from 1 January 2000 to 8 November 2021, on the basis that ITN programmes did not begin to be implemented as policy before the year 2000. Selection criteria: We included cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), or controlled before-after studies (CBAs) comparing IRS plus ITNs with ITNs alone. We included studies with at least 50% ITN ownership (defined as the proportion of households owning one or more ITN) in both study arms. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, analyzed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We stratified by type of insecticide, 'pyrethroid-like' and 'non-pyrethroid-like'; the latter could improve malaria control better than adding IRS insecticides that have the same way of working as the insecticide on ITNs ('pyrethroid-like'). We used subgroup analysis of ITN usage in the studies to explore heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: Eight cRCTs (10 comparisons), one CBA, and one ITS study, all conducted since 2008 in sub-Saharan Africa, met our inclusion criteria. The primary vectors in all sites were mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles gambiae s.l. complex species; five studies in Benin, Mozambique, Ghana, Sudan, and Tanzania also reported the vector Anopheles funestus. Five cRCTs and both quasi-experimental design studies used insecticides with targets different to pyrethroids (two used bendiocarb, three used pirimiphos-methyl, and one used propoxur. Each of these studies were conducted in areas where the vectors were described as resistant or highly resistant to pyrethroids. Two cRCTs used dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane (DDT), an insecticide with the same target as pyrethroids. The remaining cRCT used both types of insecticide (pyrethroid deltamethrin in the first year, switching to bendiocarb for the second year). Indoor residual spraying using 'non-pyrethroid-like' insecticides. Six studies were included (four cRCTs, one CBA, and one ITS). Our main analysis for prevalence excluded a study at high risk of bias due to repeated sampling of the same population. This risk did not apply to other outcomes. Overall, the addition of IRS reduced malaria parasite prevalence (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88; 4 cRCTs, 16,394 participants; high-certainty evidence). IRS may also reduce malaria incidence on average (rate ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.23; 4 cRCTs, 323,631 child-years; low-certainty evidence) but the effect was absent in two studies. Subgroup analyses did not explain the qualitative heterogeneity between studies. One cRCT reported no effect on malaria incidence or parasite prevalence in the first year, when a pyrethroid-like insecticide was used for IRS, but showed an effect on both outcomes in the second year, when a non-pyrethroid-like IRS was used. The addition of IRS may also reduce anaemia prevalence (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.31; 3 cRCTs, 4288 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four cRCTs reported the impact of IRS on entomological inoculation rate (EIR), with variable results; overall, we do not know if IRS had any effect on the EIR in communities using ITNs (very low-certainty evidence). Studies also reported the adult mosquito density and the sporozoite rate, but we could not summarize or pool these entomological outcomes due to differences in the reported data. Three studies measured the prevalence of pyrethroid resistance before and after IRS being introduced: there was no difference detected, but these data are limited. Indoor residual spraying using 'pyrethroid-like' insecticides. Adding IRS using a pyrethroid-like insecticide did not appear to markedly alter malaria incidence (rate ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.43; 2 cRCTs, 15,717 child-years; moderate-certainty evidence), parasite prevalence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; 3 cRCTs, 10,820 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or anaemia prevalence (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 1 cRCT, 4186 participants; low-certainty evidence). Data on EIR were limited so no conclusion was made (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: in communities using ITNs, the addition of IRS with 'non-pyrethroid-like' insecticides was associated with reduced malaria prevalence. Malaria incidence may also be reduced on average, but there was unexplained qualitative heterogeneity, and the effect may therefore not be observed in all settings. When using 'pyrethroid-like' insecticides, there was no detectable additional benefit of IRS in communities using ITNs. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The etiology of preterm birth has not yet been elucidated. Although maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk for preterm birth, associations have not been confirmed. We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationships between maternal exposure to EDCs and preterm birth. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies providing quantitative data on the association between maternal EDC exposure and preterm birth in humans was conducted in July 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. A total of 59 studies were included. The pooled results indicated that maternal exposure to metals (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29) and phthalates (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.42) was related to an increased risk for preterm birth. Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth.

Their adaptation in response to environmental stressors, particularly mitigating the impact of pollutants discharged from human activities, has been considered for the development of microbial biomonitoring tools, but their use is still in the infancy. Here, chemical and molecular (16S rRNA gene metabarcoding) approaches were combined in order to determine the impact of pollutants on microbial assemblages inhabiting the aquatic network of a soil-water-sediment continuum around the Ichkeul Lake (Tunisia), an area highly impacted by human activities. Samples were collected within the soil-river-lake continuum at three stations in dry (summer) and wet (winter) seasons. The contaminant pressure index (PI), which integrates Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkanes, Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and metal contents, and the microbial pressure index microgAMBI, based on bacterial community structure, showed significant correlation with contamination level and differences between seasons. The comparison of prokaryotic communities further revealed specific assemblages for soil, river and lake sediments. Correlation analyses identified potential “specialist” genera for the different compartments, whose abundances were correlated with the pollutant type found. Additionally, PICRUSt analysis revealed the metabolic potential for pollutant transformation or degradation of the identified “specialist” species, providing information to estimate the recovery capacity of the ecosystem. Such findings offer the possibility to define a relevant set of microbial indicators for assessing the effects of human activities on aquatic ecosystems. Microbial indicators, including the detection of “specialist” and sensitive taxa, and their functional capacity, might be useful, in combination with integrative microbial indices, to constitute accurate biomonitoring tools for the management and restoration of complex coastal aquatic systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: R.

PFPE has been widely used in aerospace, military, nuclear industry, computer disk and other fields. With the rapid development of industrial technology, new requirements have been proposed for the performance of the lubricants. As a result, the common perfluoropolyethers as lubricants gradually cannot work well under the present working conditions. Moreover, it is difficult to improve the lubrication performance of perfluoropolyethers by conventional additives technology due to their poor compatibility with conventional additives. Hence, in order to improve the antifriction and antiwear properties of perfluoropolyethers, researchers focused on modifying their structures. Great efforts have been paid to improve the performance of perfluoropolyethers as lubrication film in the field of computer disk, but as a kind of important aviation lubricating oils, their lubrication performances are also in urgent need of improvement. In this context, in this study three kinds of perfluoropolyether carboxylate ammonium ionic liquids (PF-BA, PF-DBA and PF-TBA) were designed and synthesized by modifying the structure of perfluoropolyether carboxylic acid (PFPEC) with different amines. The structures of synthesized ionic liquids were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Their shear stress and viscosity at different shear rates were evaluated by a Rheometer, and the wetting ability on metal surfaces were analyzed by the contact angle. Their lubrication performance for steel/steel and steel/tin bronze friction pairs at 25 ℃ and 100 ℃ were evaluated and compared by Optimal SRV-V oscillating friction and wear tester, where PFPE and PFPEC were used as reference samples. And the variation of the tribofilm during the friction process were revealed by the change of contact resistance. The surface morphologies and element state were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. Tribochemical reactions were investigated by comparing the change in surface morphologies and element state of wear spot. By combining the above results, the lubrication mechanism was explored. Results showed that all the synthesized ionic liquids exhibited higher shear stress and viscosity than PFPEC. Specifically, the ionic liquids with more N-H bonds in the cation exhibited higher viscosity and shear stress, possibly due to the formation of hydrogen bond that can increase the intermolecular interactions. The viscosity and shear stress gradually decreased with the increase of shear rate, while the viscosity of the ionic liquids with more N-H bond in the cation decreased more rapidly. On the surface of tin bronze, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting performance than PFPEC, but poorer than PFPE. While on the steel surface, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting abilities than PFPEC and PFPE. As lubricants for steel/tin bronze friction pairs, the friction coefficients and wear volumes of the three ionic liquids were close to those of PFPE and PFPEC at room temperature, and their lubrication performance was improved insignificantly. The synthesized ionic liquids exhibited much better anti-friction and anti-wear performance at high temperature (100 ℃) than PFPE and PFPEC. As lubricants for steel/steel friction pairs at room temperature, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were similar to that of PFPEC, and even a little higher than PFPE; while the wear volumes decreased about 60%-70% in comparison with PFPE and PFPEC. At 100 ℃, compared with PFPE and PFPEC, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were much more stable and lower, and the wear volumes were reduced by 70% ~ 80%. Summarily, three synthesized ionic liquids had better friction-reduction and anti-wear properties than that of PFPE and PFPEC both at room temperature and at high temperature as lubricants for steel/steel friction pair. The contact resistances reflected the variation of the tribofilm, i.e. the higher contact resistance, the thicker tribofilm and better lubricating properties. The results of tested contact resistances were consistent with the friction tests results. According to the SEM morphologies of the worn surface lubricated by different lubricants, both the tin bronze and steel worn surfaces exhibited abrasive wear. Among them, the worn surfaces lubricated by ionic liquids PF-TBA were the smoother, and the parallel grooves were the shallower both at room temperature and high temperature. The steel worn surfaces lubricated by the three ionic liquids were much smoother than that of PEPE and PEPEC. From the XPS results, it can be seen that the composition and content of the friction films on the worn surface lubricated by the three synthesized ionic liquids were different from that of PEPEC. The tribofilm formed on the steel surfaces lubricated by the ionic liquids was consisted of Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and FeF3, the nitrogen-containing compounds and adsorbed ionic liquids. The adsorption film of the ionic liquids on the metal surface was strong and the tribofilm was thick. The combined results of multiple physical and chemical analysis showed that the excellent friction-reduction and anti-wear properties of synthesized ionic liquids can be attributed to their excellent adsorption properties on the metal surface and the formation of stable tribofilm.

Aging processes such as UV irradiation, biodegradation, physical abrasion and chemical oxidation can affect the environmental behavior of MPs. This review article summarizes different aging processes of MPs and subsequent effects on the adsorption of pollutants, the leaching of additives, and the toxicity of MPs. In addition, the formation process of biofilm on the surface of MPs and the interactions between biofilm and aged MPs are revealed. MPs can accumulate different environmental pollutants (organic pollutants, heavy metals, microorganisms, etc.) through surface adsorption, pore filling and distribution. Moreover, the aging of MPs affects their adsorption performance toward these pollutants due to a series of changes in their specific surface area and oxygen-containing functional groups. The release of some toxic additives such as phthalates after aging can enhance the toxic effects of MPs. Aging also changes the shape and size of MPs, which can affect the eating habits of the organisms and further increase the potential toxicity of MPs. This article conducts a systematical analysis and summary of the environmental behavior and physicochemical properties of MPs as well as the changes due to MPs aging, which helps to better understand the impact of aging on MPs in the environment.

A large number of organic chemicals are termed as “micropollutants” due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 170; Correspondence Address: X.

In China, many monitoring studies have been undertaken to reveal the level of PCBs in environment since 2005 due to the introduced stricter environmental regulations. However, there are still significant gaps in understanding the overall spatial and temporal distributions of PCBs in China. This review systematically discusses the occurrence and distribution of PCBs in environmental matrices, organisms, and humans in China. Results showed that PCB contamination in northern and southern China was not significantly different, but the PCB levels in East China were commonly higher than those in West China, which might have been due to the widespread consumption of PCBs and intensive human activities in East China. Serious PCB contamination was found in e-waste disassembling areas (e.g., Taizhou of Zhejiang Province and Qingyuan and Guiyu of Guangdong Province). Higher PCB concentrations were also chronicled in megalopolises and industrial clusters. The unintentionally produced PCBs (UP-PCBs) formed during industrial thermal processes may play an increasingly significant role in PCB pollution in China. Low PCB levels were recorded in rural and underdeveloped districts, particularly in remote and high-altitude localities such as the Tibetan Plateau and the South China Sea. However, these data are limited. Human exposure to PCBs is closely related to the characteristics of environmental pollution. This review also discusses existing issues and future research prospects on PCBs in China. For instance, the accumulation characteristics and migration regularities of PCBs in food webs should be further studied.

Although the aetiology remains unclear, evidence is mounting that exposure to persistent hydrocarbon pollutants is a substantial risk factor, predisposing a person to neurological diseases later in life. Epidemiological studies correlate environmental hydrocarbon exposure to brain disorders including neuropathies, cognitive, motor and sensory impairments; neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Particulate matter, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and endocrine-disrupting chemicals have all been linked to neurodevelopmental problems in all class of people. There is mounting evidence that supports the prevalence of petroleum hydrocarbon becoming neurotoxic and being involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. More study is needed to fully comprehend the scope of these problems in the context of unconventional oil and natural gas. This review summarises in vitro, animal and epidemiological research on the genesis of neurodegenerative disorders, highlighting evidence that supports inexorable role of hazardous hydrocarbon exposure in the pathophysiology of AD and PD.

The degradation efficiency of the sonochemical systems, the influence of the nature of the pollutant (volatile, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic character), matrix effects (enhancement or detrimental ability compared to pure water), and the role of the contaminant concentration were considered. The combinations of ultrasound with other degradation processes, to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the sonochemical process, were considered.

However, as a result of modernization, water consumption is dramatically in increase although the water supply remains constant. Unfortunately every sector consumes water resulting in massive amounts of wastewater that requires treatment prior to their final disposal that still a challenge to the modern societies. Among the various technologies investigated, adsorption considered the most widely applied technology for safe environmental remediation. In this regard, the term of green adsorbents is introduced that is meant the low-cost materials originated from waste, i.e., agriculture waste to be valuable adsorbents. Thus, extensive list of different adsorbents from natural, industrial waste, agriculture bio-products or modified materials have been applied for the elimination of various contaminants from aqueous matrix are compiled here as a demanding area since it has double benefits as an industrial ecology approach. Also, this article discusses the basic principles of adsorption process including the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Although numerous review articles are dealing with low-cost adsorption performances, there is insufficient information on the emerging pollutants elimination. The major focus of this work is highlighting the research on the application of the low-cost adsorbents on the emerging pollutants, namely, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and perfluorinated compounds. Scattered information on using various adsorbents are provided information in adsorbing emerging pollutants uptake reached to 920 mg/g. The main parameters that affect the adsorption process and the economic prospective is also discussed. Desorption and recycling scenario is concluded and desorption efficiency could reach to 99%.

The ambiguity and insufficiency of data when diagnosing adolescent women have been put under special focus. We look at some of the most recent research done to establish relationships between different gene polymorphisms with polycystic ovary syndrome in various populations along with the underestimated impact of environmental factors like endocrine-disrupting chemicals on the reproductive health of these women. Furthermore, the article concludes with existing treatments options and the scopes for advancement in the near future. Various therapies have been considered as potential treatment through multiple randomized controlled studies, and clinical trials conducted over the years are described in this article.

Objective: To investigate the mechanism underlying the repair of DEHP-induced sperm DNA damage in mice by Wuwei Fuzheng Yijing (WFY) formula. Materials and methods: The potential targets of WFY and sperm DNA fragment (SDF) were obtained from the TCMSP, BATMAN-TCM, OMIM and GeneCards. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, GO and KEGG pathway analyses of WFY-SDF were constructed. An animal model of DEHP-induced sperm DNA damage was replicated by gavage of SPF ICR (CD1) mice DEHP at 1 g/kg/d and treated with WFY at 8.92, 17.84 and 35.67 g/kg, respectively, for 60 d. Sperm DFI of each group was detected and compared. The target genes of WFY identified by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were validated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Results: Network pharmacology pathway analysis indicated that PI3K/Akt was the potential target of WFY on SDF. The DFI of the DEHP group (25.48%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (4.02%). The high-dose WFY group (19.05%) exhibited the most significant repairing effect. The related pathways were PI3K/Akt and metabolic. Aass, Aldh1a7, GSTA3, betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (Bhmt), Mug2 and Svs1 were screened and Bhmt was validated. Discussion and conclusions: WFY can repair sperm DNA damage caused by DEHP, and the mechanism may be related to PI3K/Akt and metabolic pathways, and Bhmt.

This article aims to provide a narrative updated review on the management of pediculosis capitis. Methods: A PubMed search was performed with Clinical Queries using the key terms ""pediculosis capitis"" OR ""head lice"" OR ""head louse"". The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and reviews published within the past 10 years. The search was restricted to articles published in English literature. The information retrieved from the search was used in the compilation of the present article. Results: Topical permethrin and pyrethrin formulated with piperonyl butoxide are the pediculicides of choice in areas where resistance to these products is low. When resistance to these products is suspected based on local levels of resistance or when treatment with these products fails despite their correct use, and reinfestation does not seem to be responsible, other topical treatment options include malathion, benzyl alcohol, dimethicone, spinosad and ivermectin. Wet combing should be considered for children younger than 2 years. Oral ivermectin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be reserved for patients who do not respond to appropriate topical pediculicides. Conclusion: Many topical pediculicides are effective for the treatment of pediculosis capitis. The use of some of these pediculicides is limited for safety reasons, especially in children younger than 2 years. Resistance to pediculicides, especially those with a neurotoxic mode of action, is another concern which may limit the use of some of these pediculicides. New products should be evaluated for effectiveness and safety. Wet combing is time-consuming and should not be used as the sole intervention in the general population. © 2022 Bioexcel Publishing LTD.

Recent reports indicate the Australian community consumes more than twice the defined daily doses (DDD) of antibiotics per 1000 population than in Sweden, and about 20% more than in the United Kingdom (UK). We compare measures of public knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surrounding AMR in Australia, the UK and Sweden against the policy approaches taken in these settings to address inappropriate antibiotic use. Methods National antimicrobial stewardship policies in Australia, Sweden, and the UK were reviewed, supplemented by empirical studies of their effectiveness. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL databases for primary studies of the general public's KAP around antibiotic use and AMR in each setting (January 1 2011 until July 30 2021). Where feasible, we meta-analysed data on the proportion of participants agreeing with identical or very similar survey questions, using a random effects model. Results Policies in Sweden enact tighter control of community antibiotic use; reducing antibiotic use through public awareness raising is not a priority. Policies in the UK and Australia are more reliant on practitioner and public education to encourage appropriate antibiotic use. 26 KAP were included in the review and 16 were meta-analysable. KAP respondents in Australia and the UK are consistently more likely to report beliefs and behaviours that are not aligned with appropriate antibiotic use, compared to participants in similar studies conducted in Sweden. Conclusions Interactions between public knowledge, attitudes and their impacts on behaviours surrounding community use of antibiotics are complex and contingent. Despite a greater focus on raising public awareness in Australia and the UK, neither antibiotic consumption nor community knowledge and attitudes are changing significantly. Clearly public education campaigns can contribute to mitigating AMR. However, the relative success of policy approaches taken in Sweden suggests that practice level interventions may also be required to activate prescribers and the communities they serve to make substantive reductions in inappropriate antibiotic use.

Grow-ing evidence has shown that intestinal bacterial alterations caused by BPA exposure play an important role in several local and systemic diseases. Aims: finding evidence that BPA-induced alterations in gut microbiota composition and activity may perturb its role on human health. Results: Evidence from several experimental settings shows that both low and high doses of BPA in-terfere with the hormonal, homeostatic, and reproductive systems in animals and humans. Moreover, it has recently been classified as an environmental obesogenic, with metabolic-disrupting effects on lipid metabolism and pancreatic b-cell functions. Several evidence characterizes PBA as an environmental contributor to type II diabetes, metabolic syndromes, and obesity. However, the highest estimates of the exposure derived from foods alone or in combination with other sources are 3 to 5 times below the new tolerable daily intake (TDI) value, today reduced by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) experts from 50 micrograms per kilogramme of bodyweight per day (µg/kg bw/day) to 4 µg/kg bw/day. Conclusion: Considering estimates for the total amount of BPA that can be ingested daily over a lifetime, many International Health Authorities conclude that dietary exposure of adult humans to BPA does not represent a risk to consumers' health, declaring its safety due to very-low established levels in food and water and any appreciable health risk. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: I.A.

Objective: To summarize the epidemiological evidence for the association of p,p'-DDT exposure and its breakdown products with the risk of diabetes and HTN from prospective studies. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Eligible studies (prospective) were search in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and SciELO databases (July 11, 2020). Different search algorithms were used for diabetes and HTN. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated from meta-analysis with random effects for each exposure and outcome. Results: A total of 23 prospective studies were included in this review, 16 assessed diabetes and seven HTN; very few measured p,p'-DDT. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was associated with a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (pooled OR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.00, 2.07; p = 0.049) and HTN (pooled OR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.38). Dose-response meta-analysis suggested a non-linear relation between p,p'-DDE and T2D. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was not associated with gestational diabetes (pooled OR = 1.01; 95%CI: 0.94, 1.09); similarly, p,p'-DDT was not associated with T2D (pooled OR = 1.03; 95%CI: 0.79, 1.35). Conclusions: Evidence from prospective studies suggests that exposure to p,p'-DDE, the main breakdown product of p,p'-DDT, might increase the risk of developing T2D; such increase may be apparent only at low levels. Exposure to p,p'-DDE may also increase the risk of having HTN; however, further evidence is required. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: L.A.

There is still little evidence on which is the best FT option in kidney graft neoplasms and on its therapeutic indications. We performed a systematic review to assess the role of FT such as thermal ablation, interventional radiotherapy, electrochemotherapy, and stereotactic body radiotherapy, as alternative to NSS in the treatment of Stage I kidney cancer. We searched PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science for articles published between 2010 and 2020 focusing on kidney transplant recipients with kidney graft neoplasm who had undergone FT.

Widespread use of PFAS in industrial processing and manufacturing over the last 70 years has led to global contamination of built and natural environments. The brain is a lipid rich and highly vascularized organ composed of long-lived neurons and glial cells that are especially vulnerable to the impacts of persistent and lipophilic toxicants. Generally, PFAS partition to protein-rich tissues of the body, primarily the liver and blood, but are also detected in the brains of humans, wildlife, and laboratory animals. Here we review factors impacting the absorption, distribution, and accumulation of PFAS in the brain, and currently available evidence for neurotoxic impacts defined by disruption of neurochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioral endpoints. Emphasis is placed on the neurotoxic potential of exposures during critical periods of development and in sensitive populations, and factors that may exacerbate neurotoxicity of PFAS. While limitations and inconsistencies across studies exist, the available body of evidence suggests that the neurobehavioral impacts of long-chain PFAS exposures during development are more pronounced than impacts resulting from exposure during adulthood. There is a paucity of experimental studies evaluating neurobehavioral and molecular mechanisms of short-chain PFAS, and even greater data gaps in the analysis of neurotoxicity for PFAS outside of the perfluoroalkyl acids. Whereas most experimental studies were focused on acute and subchronic impacts resulting from high dose exposures to a single PFAS congener, more realistic exposures for humans and wildlife are mixtures exposures that are relatively chronic and low dose in nature. Our evaluation of the available human epidemiological, experimental, and wildlife data also indicates heightened accumulation of perfluoroalkyl acids in the brain after environmental exposure, in comparison to the experimental studies. These findings highlight the need for additional experimental analysis of neurodevelopmental impacts of environmentally relevant concentrations and complex mixtures of PFAS.

Previous systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies published between 1991 through 2013 have reported associations between environmental and occupational pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality, particularly associations with reduced sperm concentration. This systematic review used the Navigation Guide to critically evaluate the current body of evidence examining sperm quality and pesticide exposure in epidemiological studies. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for all English-language articles published after September 2012 until August 2021. Original observational studies that assessed human sperm quality parameters, defined as concentration, motility, morphology, and DNA integrity, and individual-level pesticide exposure were included. The risk of bias for each included study and the strength of evidence were evaluated using the Navigation Guide protocol. Nineteen studies assessing environmental or occupational pesticide exposure and sperm parameters were included. Eighteen studies were cross-sectional studies and one prospective cohort; sample sizes ranged from 42 to 2122 men from 14 different countries. Fifteen (79 %) studies found at least one significant association between pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality. The overall risk of bias across studies was classified as low to moderate. The quality of evidence was determined to be moderate based on systematic evaluation criteria. There were consistent adverse associations between pesticide exposure and sperm motility (63 % of studies) and DNA integrity (80 % of studies). For sperm concentration and morphology, 42 % and 36 % of studies found significant negative associations, respectively. The strength of the body of evidence overall was rated as having sufficient evidence of toxicity. Regarding specific sperm endpoints, there was sufficient evidence that pesticides are toxic for sperm motility and DNA integrity; limited evidence of toxicity for sperm concentration; and inadequate evidence of toxicity for sperm morphology. The studies reviewed here showed consistent associations between pesticide exposure and diminished sperm parameters, particularly sperm motility and sperm DNA integrity. These findings are largely consistent with results of previous reviews, which have found significant negative associations between pesticide exposure and sperm quality in 13 of 20 (65 %) studies published between 1991 and 2008, and in 14 of 17 (82 %) studies published between 2008 and 2012.

In this study, the comparative profiles of metabolites in three-dimensional (3D) human normal liver (L-02) cell spheroids with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) treatment were analyzed using a metabolomic approach. The uniform 3D cell spheroids were well formed in 3 days (e.g., sphericity index >0.9) and stably maintained over the subsequent 11 days. The cytotoxicity of PFOA to the 3D L-02 cell spheroids was highly dependent on both exposure concentration and duration. Comparative analysis of metabolomes showed that the number of differential metabolites in the 3D cell spheroids treated with 300 μM PFOA for 10 days (n = 59) was greater than those with a 4-day exposure to 300 μM PFOA (n = 17). Six metabolic pathways related to amino acids metabolism were only found in the 3D cell spheroids with a 10-day treatment of 300 μM PFOA, which could not be found in the 2D monolayer cells and those 3D cell spheroids with a 4-day exposure. The suppression of PFOA on glutamine metabolism substantially decreased glutathione (GSH) production and accordingly increased the level of reactive oxygen species in the 3D cell spheroids. On the contrary, the supplementation of glutamine increased GSH production and the viability of cell spheroids, indicating that glutamine metabolism played a critical role in the chronic toxic effects of PFOA. Our study strongly suggested that comprehensive toxicological methodologies based on the 3D cell models could currently be robust and suitable for addressing the chronic adverse effects of toxic contaminants. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: T.

This study explored the systematic evaluation and meta-analysis of different concentrations of PCP on the risk of long-term bradycardia in fetuses. Methods. Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, China Biomedical Literature Service, CNCNKI, and Wanfang database were computerized to collect all case-control studies on the association between variety classes and different concentrations of environmental pollutant gas to fetal of prolonged bradycardia. After evaluating the quality of the inclusion study and extracting valid data, meta-analysis was performed using Stata15 software. Relative hazards were calculated using the Mantel-Haenszel method and the random effect model, and P values and I2 values were used for heterogeneity evaluation. When heterogeneity occurs, subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the sources. Results. A total of 15 studies were included, including 1202 patients with fetal of prolonged bradycardia and 1380 in the control population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference in PCP < 0.1 mg/L between the experimental group and control group (OR = 1.03, 95% CI (0.62, 1.72), P=0.90, I2 = 0%, Z = 0.13), but there was a statistical difference in PCP > 5 mg/L (OR = 1.73, 95% CI (1.15, 2.58), P=0.008, I2 = 0%, Z = 2.65), PCP > 10 mg/L (OR = 1.75, 95% CI (1.19, 2.57), P=0.004, I2 = 14%, Z = 2.85), and PCP >15 mg/L (OR = 2.02, 95% CI (1.38, 2.95), P=0.0003, I2 = 77%, Z = 3.61).

This study aimed to review the insecticide resistance status was previously determined in Asia and how to implement the necessary interventions. Moreover, the implications of resistance in malaria vector control in this region were studied. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using a predefined protocol based on PRISMA-retrieved articles from four science databases, namely ProQuest, Science Direct, EBSCO, and PubMed in the last ten years (2009 to 2019). The searching process utilized four main combinations of the following keywords: malaria, vector control, insecticide, and Asia. In ProQuest, malaria control, as well as an insecticide, were used as keywords. The following criteria were included in the filter, namely full text, the source of each article, scholarly journal, Asia, and publication date as in the last ten years. Results: There were 1408 articles retrieved during the initial search (ProQuest=722, Science Direct=267, EBSCO=50, PubMed=285, and Scopus=84). During the screening, 27 articles were excluded because of duplication, 1361 based on title and abstract incompatibility with the inclusion criteria, and 20 due to content differences. In the final screening process, 15 articles were chosen to be analyzed. From the 15 articles, it is known that there was organochlorine (DDT), organophosphate (malathion), and pyrethroids resistance in several Anopheles species with a less than 80% mortality rate. Conclusion: This review found multiple resistance in several Anopheles includes resistance to pyrethroid. The reports of pyrethroid resistance were quite challenging because it is considered effective in the malaria vector control.

The complex interactions that occur between synthetic MPs polymers and hydrophobic toxic compounds, metals, additives, and other emergent contaminants complicates the standardization of techniques used for the extraction and quantitation of these chemicals. Organic compounds are extracted from MPs by soaking, sonication, and the use of microwave, Soxhlet and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) techniques in a variety of polar and nonpolar solvents. The extracts are cleaned up through solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) using an assortment of detectors. The analysis of metals from MPs is more standardized, usually with extraction in 20% aqua regia and analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (ICP-MS). Published papers do not consistently report the use of standards, detection levels, and other quality control measures.

Characterizing its chemical compositions and source contributions is a critical prerequisite for effective control of PM2.5 pollution. This paper systematically reviews the sampling methods, chemical compositions, and source apportionments of PM2.5. Sampling methods have significant influences on the identification of chemical compositions and source contributions, with Quartz and Teflon filters being the most widely used. Receptor models are commonly adopted for identifying the sources of PM2.5, such as positive matrix factorization, chemical mass balance, principal component analysis, and UNMIX models, which have their respective advantages and limitations that determine their applications. The variations of PM2.5 compositions and sources in the past two decades in Beijing are also reviewed, which is the political, economic, and cultural center of China and is experiencing severe haze pollution events frequently. It was found that organic matters were the largest component (28.2%) in PM2.5, followed by sulfate (15.1%) during 2004–2013, which was overtaken by nitrate (14.9%) after 2013. Each PM2.5 source demonstrated significant seasonal and annual variations due to changes in climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities.

These bio-based fertilizers have heterogeneous nutrient and metal contents, resulting in a range of possible application rates. To avoid nutrient losses to water or bioaccumulation of metals in soil or crops, it is important that rates applied to land are safe and adhere to the maximum legal application rates similar to inorganic fertilizers. This study collected and analysed nutrient and metal content of all major DPS (n = 84) and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products (n = 10), and created an application calculator in MS Excel™ to provide guidance on maximum legal application rates for ryegrass and spring wheat across plant available phosphorus (P) deficient soil to P-excess soil. The sample analysis showed that raw DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS have high P contents ranging from 10.1 to 122 g kg−1. Nitrogen (N) in DPS was high, whereas N concentrations decreased in thermo-chemical STRUBIAS products (chars and ash) due to the high temperatures used in their formation. The heavy metal content of DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS was significantly lower than the EU imposed limits. Using the calculator, application rates of DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS materials (dry weight) ranged from 0 to 4.0 tonnes ha−1 y−1 for ryegrass and 0–4.5 tonnes ha−1 y−1 for spring wheat. The estimated heavy metal ingestion to soil annually by the application of the DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products was lower than the EU guideline on soil metal accumulation. The calculator is adaptable for any bio-based fertilizer, soil and crop type, and future work should continue to characterise and incorporate new DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products into the database presented in this paper. In addition, safe application rates pertaining to other regulated pollutants or emerging contaminants that may be identified in these products should be included. The fertilizer replacement value of these products, taken from long-term field studies, should be factored into application rates. © 2021 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: O.

Lay abstract: Autism spectrum disorders comprise a complex group with many subtypes of behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental abnormalities in two core areas: deficits in social communication and fixated, restricted, repetitive, or stereotyped behaviors and interests each with potential unique risk factors and characteristics. The underlying mechanisms and the possible causes of autism spectrum disorder remain elusive and while increased prevalence is undoubtable, it is unclear if it is a reflection of diagnostic improvement or emerging risk factors such as endocrine disrupting chemicals. Epidemiological studies, which are used to study the relation between endocrine disrupting chemicals and autism spectrum disorder, can have inherent methodological challenges that limit the quality and strength of their findings. The objective of this work is to systematically review the treatment of these challenges and assess the quality and strength of the findings in the currently available literature.

The bibliographic analysis was applied to evaluate how approaches in sediment assessment have evolved. A meta-analysis was performed, to evaluate potential risks of sedimentary persistent toxic substances (PTSs) reported in Korean coastal waters. Within the framework, we identified and discussed current status and spatiotemporal trends in contamination of both classic and emerging PTSs over the recent decadal period. Out of 26 target regions in Korea, five hotspots (Sihwa, Masan, Ulsan, Taean, and Gwangyang) of concern could be identified. Four of those regions have been designated as Specially-Managed Sea Area under the implementation of Total Pollution Load Management System in Korea, except for Taean coast (oil spill site). Meantime, we could identify three stepwise research phases based on a bibliographic analysis; Phase 1 (1995–2008), Phase 2 (2009–2015), and Phase 3 (2016–2020). It is noteworthy that a technical evolution of the SQT assessment by the phase was featured. It was also evidenced that in-depth studies adopting multiple lines of evidence (LOEs) became prevailed upon approaching Phase 3. In a quantitative manner, the toxicity explanatory power of target PTSs increased by about 10% in Phase 3 compared to the earlier phases. The meta-analysis using ratio-to-mean value method applied for the data set having all three LOEs indicated general improvement of sediment qualities in the hotspots. However, their associations quite varied across regions and years, reflecting a dynamicity in oceanographic settings and/or heterogeneity in toxicological effect or benthic community response. At present, SQT assessment adopting the increased LOEs generally supports better assessment. In conclusion, we suggest that future SQT studies globally should reaffirm the utility of the “multiple LOEs approach”, focusing on the identification and management of causative toxicants that driving negative ecological impacts on marine ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: J.S.

Despite its ban for agricultural use, organochlorine was the most studied pesticide group (60%; 86% of studies included DDT). Current-used pesticides in agriculture were studied in 54% of the study sites (including insecticides (92%), herbicides (44%), and fungicides (35%)). Environmental samples were collected in 67% of the studies (e.g., water, aquatic species, sediment, agricultural produce, and air). In 38% of the studies, human subjects were investigated. Only few studies had a longitudinal design or assessed pesticide’s environmental risks; human biomarkers; dose-response in human subjects, including children and women; and interventions to reduce pesticide exposure.

In this study, an aromatic ring cleavage module, a salicylic acid synthesis module, and a catechol metabolism module were respectively constructed in three Escherichia coli BL21 strains. Subsequently, the engineered strains were cocultured as an artificial consortium for the biodegradation of phenanthrene, a typical PHA. Single factor experiments and response surface methodology were used to identify the optimal degradation conditions, including an inoculation interval of 6 h, inoculation ratio of 1:1:1, and IPTG concentration of 2 mM. Under these conditions, the 7-day degradation ratio of 100 mg/L phenanthrene reached 72.67%. Moreover, the engineered Escherichia coli BL21 strains showed good phenanthrene degradation ability at substrate concentrations 10 mg/L up to 500 mg/L. Enzyme activity assays combined with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry measurements confirmed that the three engineered strains behaved as a synergistic consortium in the phenanthrene degradation process. Based on the analysis of the key metabolites, the engineered bacteria were supplemented at 7-day intervals in batches so that each engineered strain maintained its optimal degradation ability. The 21-day degradation ratio finally reached 90.66%, which was much higher than what was observed with simultaneous inoculation. These findings suggest that the three engineered strains with separate modules constructed in this study offer an attractive solution for removing PAHs from the environment. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: X.

Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

PD is considered a multifactorial disease, since both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its pathogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms linking these two key disease modifiers remain obscure. In this context, epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene expression without affecting the DNA sequence through DNA methylation, histone post-transcriptional modifications, and non-coding RNAs may represent the key mediators of the genetic–environmental interactions underlying PD pathogenesis. Environmental exposures may cause chemical alterations in several cellular functions, including gene expression. Emerging evidence has highlighted that smoking, coffee consumption, pesticide exposure, and heavy metals (manganese, arsenic, lead, etc.) may potentially affect the risk of PD development at least partially via epigenetic modifications. Herein, we discuss recent accumulating pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the impact of lifestyle and environmental factors on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PD development, aiming to shed more light on the pathogenesis and stimulate future research. © 2022 by the authors.

Our chemical footprint is often detected using targeted approaches, whereas xenobiotics are embedded within the large pool of dissolved metabolites, altered by biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Thus, it is necessary to simultaneously study anthropogenic signals entwined with the variety of organic signatures that exist in aquatic environments. However, methods for non-targeted analysis of natural metabolites are not always well suited for the analysis of pollutants. Here, we report the reassessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer-based Priority PolLutant (PPL) solid-phase extraction (PPL-SPE), which is typically used to extract marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) for biogeochemical studies, to analyze a set of xenobiotics commonly observed in coastal North Pacific seawater. After PPL extraction and analysis by nontargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), we successfully detected 23 out of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products, biocides, perfluorocarbons, and polymer additives in a complex marine DOM sample using positive and negative electrospray ionization. We tested two pH conditions to mimic typical marine DOM extraction studies and found mean recovery rates of xenobiotics were approximately 10% higher in seawater pH (pH ~ 8) than in acidified samples (pH ~ 2) for both negative and positive modes, although overall, mean recovery rates were 10% lower in negative mode. Our results indicate that PPL-SPE in combination with non-targeted LC–MS/MS is capable of capturing the tested set of xenobiotics, thus allowing the repurposing of biogeochemical sampling strategies as well as existing DOM samples and MS data for the subsequent assessment of anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. © 2021 The Authors.

The Lancet Commission (2020) has recognized air pollution as a risk factor for dementia. However, the scientific evidence on the impact of air pollution on cognitive outcomes across the life course and across different income settings, with varying levels of air pollution, needs further exploration. A systematic review was conducted, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) Guidelines to assess the association between air pollution and cognitive outcomes across the life course with a plan to analyze findings as per the income status of the study population. The PubMed search included keywords related to cognition and to pollution (in their titles) to identify studies on human participants published in English until 10 July 2020. The search yielded 84 relevant studies that described associations between exposure to air pollutants and an increased risk of lower cognitive function among children and adolescents, cognitive impairment and decline among adults, and dementia among older adults with supportive evidence of neuroimaging and inflammatory biomarkers. No study from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs)was identified despite high levels of air pollutants and high rates of dementia. To conclude, air pollution may impair cognitive function across the life-course, but a paucity of studies from reLMICs is a major lacuna in research. © 2022 by the authors.

A random-effects model was used to estimate the pooled prevalence or proportion of antimicrobial consumption among COVID-19 patients. Expert opinion: We identified 43 original articles, 33 studies from high-income countries, six from upper-middle-income countries, and four from lower-middle-income countries. Most of the studies presented data from hospital or secondary health-care settings (n = 34). Included studies measured antimicrobial consumption as Daily Defined Doses (DDD) or day of therapy (DOT) or percentage. A total of 19 studies measured antimicrobial consumption as DDDs or DOT. Meta-analysis revealed an overall high antimicrobial consumption of 68% (95% CI: 60% to 75%). The subgroup analysis found a lower consumption in high-income countries (58%, 95% CI: 48% to 67%), compared with lower and middle-income countries (89%, 95% CI: 82% to 94%).

The available literature up to April 2021 was reviewed and transplacental transfer efficiencies (TTEs) of PFAS assessed. A total of 39 studies reporting data on 20 PFAS were included in the systematic review. Of these, 20 studies with data on 19 compounds were included in the meta-analysis. Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (CMA v3.0) was used for quantitative, statistical analyses with random effects models. A curvilinear relationship was found with short and long chains of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) exhibiting higher TTE than compounds with intermediate chain length. Among the less well studied PFAS, perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA), 6:2 fluorotelomersulfonic acid (6:2 FTS) and perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) stood out the most with a high TEEs. The dependence of TTEs on chain length and functional group is clearly shown in this first meta-analysis on PFAS transfer across the human placenta.

This review critically examines heavy metal and organic pollutants' role in wood treatment sites and their etiological consequences. These pollutants are not only recalcitrant but also tenacious to degradation under ordinary conditions. Although some heavy metals are essential to human health, they are toxic at elevated concentrations. Heavy metals feature carcinogenic properties and cause serious health risks to live systems and the environment because of their bio-accumulative, non-degenerative, and refractory characteristics. On the other hand, organic pollutants are readily introduced into the ecosystem from irresponsible use of detergents, volatile organic compounds, paints, pesticides, and wood preservatives. During the wood treatment process, various chemicals are used to enhance durability. Nevertheless, the use of wood preservatives such as chromated copper arsenate (CCA) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) potentially induces pollutants considered detrimental to human health and the ecological environment. Remediation of wood treatment sites using phytomanagement strategies and nanotechnologies has been presented in this review. Therefore, some challenges and recommendations for further research and applications are herein presented. © 2022, Sami Publishing Company.

Owing to its recalcitrant nature, endosulfan residues have been reported from air, water and soil causing toxicity to various non-target organisms. Microbial decontamination of endosulfan has been reported previously by several authors. In the current study, we have evaluated the pathways of endosulfan degradation and its hazardous impact on other living beings including insects, humans, plants, aquatic life and environment by in-silico methods. For establishment of the endosulfan metabolism in different ecosystems, cell designer was employed. The established model was thereafter assessed and simulated to understand the biochemical and physiological metabolism of the endosulfan in various systems of the network. Topological investigation analysis of the endosulfan metabolism validated the presence of 207 nodes and 274 edges in the network. We have concluded that biomagnification of the endosulfan generally occurs in the various elements of the ecosystem. Dynamics study of endosulfan degrading enzymes suggested the important role of monooxygenase I, II and hydrolase in endosulfan bioremediation. Endosulfan shows toxicity in human beings, fishes and plants, however it is biodegraded by the microbes. To date, there are no reports of in- silico analysis of bioremediation of endosulfan and its hazardous effects on the environment. Thus, this report can be important in terms of modelling and simulation of biodegradation network of endosulfan and similar compounds and their impact on several other systems.

In the USA, by 2020, PanCa is expected to be the second deadliest carcinogenesis. However, this cancer is usually asymptomatic in nature. Chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, and some infectious diseases are important risk factors. Besides these, acquired risk habits, such as smoking and high alcohol intake increase the chance of developing PanCa. Current meta-analysis suggests that the risk of PanCa may be increased by occupational exposures to chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr). In the digestive system, oxidative stress is known to initiate cancer response. Mitochondrial respiration is one of the key generation machinery, and other environmental and occupational exposures/chemical reagents that induce damage to the DNA, proteins, lipids, and produce many toxic and high mutagenic metabolites that could result in tumor behavior, changing it into a malignant phenotype, and finally in cancer cell transformation. Numerous toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic chemical substances along with stable and unstable free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), in the particulate and gas phase of tobacco smoke have the potential of biological oxidation. Several research documentations suggest that carcinogenic compounds in cigarette smoke stimulate cellular proliferation and progression of PanCa by inducing inflammation and fibrosis which results in genetic factors leading to the inhibition of cell death. It has been hypothesized that exposure to one of the occupational risk factors, Cd, a ubiquitous metal, is one of the potential cause of PanCa due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties. Evidence of involvement of Cd in PanCa development has been recently mentioned in our observational studies, meta-analyses, and experimental animal and in vitro studies. Gathering all these previous data, it is clear that oxidative stress-related responses are affected during Cd stress, but the apparent discrepancies observed in between the different research findings point towards the necessity to increase our knowledge on the spatial and temporal ROS signature under Cd stress which is present in different kinds of occupational exposures. Our present effort is to summarize findings in a systematic approach, as to how environmental and occupational risk factors induce ROS generation in PanCa, in addition to its mechanism of action, signalling cascade in the prognosis of the disease. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: N.

Microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater sludge, an anaerobic digester, and anaerobic dechlorinating cultures enriched from aquifer materials reductively dechlorinated 6:2 Cl-PFESA to 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA), which was identified as the sole metabolite by non-target analysis. Rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was achieved by the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The microbial community of the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures was impacted by 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure. Organohalide-respiring bacteria originally present in the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures, including Geobacter, Dehalobacter, and Dehalococcoides, decreased in relative abundance over time. As the relative abundance of organohalide-respiring bacteria decreased, the rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA dechlorination decreased, suggesting that the most likely mechanism for reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was co-metabolism rather than organohalide respiration. Reductive defluorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was not observed. Furthermore, 6:2 H-PFESA exhibited 5.5 times lower sorption affinity to the suspended biosolids than 6:2 Cl-PFESA, with the prospect of increased mobility in the environment. These results show the susceptibility of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to microbially mediated reductive dechlorination and the likely persistence of the product, 6:2 H-PFESA, in anaerobic environments. © 2022 American Chemical Society","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 14; Correspondence Address: L.

Besides environmental persistence, biomagnification and bioaccumulative properties, these pollutants are classified as endocrine disruptors (EDs), metabolic disruptors, neurologic disruptors. These compounds affect the normal function of several mechanisms in the human body being linked to human health issues as cancer development (e.g. breast, uterine and endometrial), miscarriage, birth defects, premature delivery and infertility. In order to prevent future health issue of women and possible progeny, the assessment of EDs accumulated is essential, particularly in adipose tissue. These samples have been referred as the ideal matrix to establish over time accumulation and long-term exposure of persistent and non-persistent lipophilic EDs. However, the invasive sample collection procedure and methodology processing discourages the usage of this matrix for biomonitoring studies. In this review, a Web of Science search without any publishing year restriction on the analysis in adipose tissue of PCB, OCP, BPA, cadmium, BFR and synthetic musks was performed. A total of 313 studies were found, 158 were European studies from which the studies with data on women EDs accumulation were selected for detailed analysis (n = 90). The results were structured and presented in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The present paper is an overview on the existent EDs analytical methods and levels accumulated in women adipose tissue, with the correspondent health implications across Europe. The limits of detection and quantification were compared and a discussion with results obtained about the presence of ED was performed. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: V.F.

Both processes are essentially microbial-mediated electron accepting processes and received much attention in last decades, due to their great importance for the remediation of environment polluted by COPs, and the effect of global warming as well as biogas property, respectively. In this study, these two reductive processes were comprehensively summarized based on 337 measurements out of 68 articles published from 1990 to 2019, with the special interest in digging their potential co-occurrence. A striking relevance between these two processes (p <.05) was shown in most cases, with the accelerated methanogenesis co-occurring with the accelerated reductive removal of COPs. The possible reason underpinning this finding was then extensively discussed. In all, by big data mining associated with discussion regarding the likely involved chemical-microbial mediate mechanisms, this study gives an update evidence showing the synergistic coupling of COP reductive removal and methanogenesis.

All these activities decrease the capability of the environment to support life thus threatening people, animal and plant health. Health implications associated with heavy metal exposure include those that disturbs nervous, blood forming, cardiovascular, renal and reproductive systems. Furthermore, accumulation of heavy metals in soil diminish quality of soil, cause crop yield decrease and affect the quality of agricultural products. It is important to appraise the concentration of heavy metals in the environment as they are toxic, persistent and nondegradable. Pollution indices are effective in appraisal of soil pollution with heavy metals, monitoring quality of soil and ensuring future sustainability.

PFOs are present in approximately 25% of the healthy population and are not associated with any pathology in the vast majority of cases. However, comparisons between patients with stroke and healthy controls suggest that PFOs may be causative of stroke in certain patients whose stroke is otherwise cryptogenic. Options for the diagnosis of PFO include transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. PFOs associated with an interatrial septal aneurysm seem to be more strongly linked to risk of recurrent stroke. Therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of a PFO include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and percutaneous device closure. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest that percutaneous closure reduces the subsequent risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients, with a large relative benefit but small absolute benefit. Referral for percutaneous PFO closure should therefore be considered in certain patients after a multidisciplinary, patient centered discussion. Areas for future study include structural biomarkers to aid in determining the role of PFO closure in older people with possible PFO associated stroke, the role of direct oral anticoagulants, and very long term outcomes after device closure.  © Published by the BMJ Publishing Group Limited.

This study conducted one of the most comprehensive literature analyses on the current status of water quality in Bangladesh with special emphasis on both conventional pollutants (heavy metal, pesticide, fecal pollution) and emerging contaminants. Concentration of heavy metals is higher in the water bodies close to the industrial zones. Prevalence of the fecal coliform has been found in the water samples taken from almost all of the studied areas. Different pesticides from organophosphate, carbamate and organochlorine groups are found in wetlands near the irrigated land of Bangladesh. Among different emerging contaminants, the presence of antibiotic residue, fluorescence whitening agent and microplastics are recently being identified in water bodies of Bangladesh. Health risk assessment of heavy metals and pesticides residues in water were evaluated using hazard quotient (HQ) and carcinogenic risk (ILCR). The results showed that the water quality of many parts of the country is already deteriorated and significant number of populations under a potential threat of water pollution.

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level.

A minority of flat feet can hurt and limit gait. There is no optimal strategy, nor consensus, for using foot orthoses (FOs) to treat paediatric flat feet. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 01 September 2021, and two clinical trials registers on 07 August 2020. Selection criteria: We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FOs as an intervention for paediatric flat feet. The outcomes included in this review were pain, function, quality of life, treatment success, and adverse events. Intended comparisons were: any FOs versus sham, any FOs versus shoes, customised FOs (CFOs) versus prefabricated FOs (PFOs). Data collection and analysis: We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane. Main results: We included 16 trials with 1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years, with flexible flat feet. Distinct flat foot presentations included asymptomatic, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), symptomatic and developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD). The trial interventions were FOs, footwear, foot and rehabilitative exercises, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Due to heterogeneity, we did not pool the data. Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic (children with JIA) flat feet. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Three comparisons were evaluated across trials: CFO versus shoes; PFO versus shoes; CFO versus PFO. Asymptomatic flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low-quality evidence showed that CFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point visual analogue scale (VAS)) at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07); absolute decrease (11.8%, 95% CI 4.7% fewer to 15.8% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19); absolute effect (3.4% more, 95% CI 4.1% fewer to 13.1% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low to very-low quality evidence showed that PFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point VAS) at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.16); absolute effect (4.7% fewer, 95% CI 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23). 3. CFOs versus PFOs (1 trial, 108 participants): low-quality evidence found no difference in the proportion without pain at one year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18); absolute effect (7.4% fewer, 95% CI 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more); or on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12). Function and quality of life (QoL) were not assessed. Symptomatic (JIA) flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 28 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) between groups (MD -1.5, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.22). Low-quality evidence showed improvements in function with CFOs (Foot Function Index - FFI disability, 0 to 100, 0 best function; MD -18.55, 95% CI -34.42 to -2.68), child-rated QoL (PedsQL, 0 to 100, 100 best quality; MD 12.1, 95% CI -1.6 to 25.8) and parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 9, 95% CI -4.1 to 22.1) and little or no difference between groups in treatment success (timed walking; MD -1.33 seconds, 95% CI -2.77 to 0.11), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.94); absolute difference (9.7% fewer, 20.5 % fewer to 44.8% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 25 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain between groups (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.94 to 1.98). Low-quality evidence showed no difference between groups in function (FFI-disability MD -4.17, 95% CI -24.4 to 16.06), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -3.84, 95% CI -19 to 11.33), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -0.64, 95% CI -13.22 to 11.94). 3. CFOs versus PFsO (2 trials, 87 participants): low-quality evidence showed little or no difference between groups in pain (0 to scale, 0 no pain) at 3 months (MD -1.48, 95% CI -3.23 to 0.26), function (FFI-disability MD -7.28, 95% CI -15.47 to 0.92), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 8.6, 95% CI -3.9 to 21.2), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 2.9, 95% CI -11 to 16.8). Authors' conclusions: Low to very low-certainty evidence shows that the effect of CFOs (high cost) or PFOs (low cost) versus shoes, and CFOs versus PFOs on pain, function and HRQoL is uncertain. This is pertinent for clinical practice, given the economic disparity between CFOs and PFOs. FOs may improve pain and function, versus shoes in children with JIA, with minimal delineation between costly CFOs and generic PFOs. This review updates that from 2010, confirming that in the absence of pain, the use of high-cost CFOs for healthy children with flexible flat feet has no supporting evidence, and draws very limited conclusions about FOs for treating paediatric flat feet. The availability of normative and prospective foot development data, dismisses most flat foot concerns, and negates continued attention to this topic. Attention should be re-directed to relevant paediatric foot conditions, which cause pain, limit function, or reduce quality of life. The agenda for researching asymptomatic flat feet in healthy children must be relegated to history, and replaced by a targeted research rationale, addressing children with indisputable foot pathology from discrete diagnoses, namely JIA, cerebral palsy, congenital talipes equino varus, trisomy 21 and Charcot Marie Tooth. Whether research resources should continue to be wasted on studying flat feet in healthy children that do not hurt, is questionable. Future updates of this review will address only relevant paediatric foot conditions. Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

This study then reviews the impacts of irrigation water on vegetables in peri- and urban areas and the associated public health implications, and emerging contaminats in irrigation water in Ghana. Considering the quality of irrigation water, loads of enteric bacteria have been reported reaching 538 mpn/ml and 940 mpn/ml. Though total and fecal coliforms and E. coli have been detected in irrigable water in Ghana, Ascaris lumbricoides, hookworm, and Trichuris trichiura were observed in vegetables. Lambda-cyhalothrin, chlorpyrifos, diazinon, alpha-endosulfan, endrin, 1,1-dichloro-2, 2-bis (4-chlorophenyl) ethylene (p,p-DDE), and hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) are the dominant pesticides detected in water used for irrigation. The presence of Cr, Cd, Co, Cu, Zn, Pb, Fe, Ni, and Mn have been reported in irrigatable water. Contaminants of emerging concern (CEC) that require extensive research in irrigation water are antibiotics, viruses (norovirus and adenovirus), and estrogens. Since untreated wastewater is predominantly used for irrigation in some parts of Ghana, high levels of Hg and Cd have been detected. Findings from this review indicate that the safety of vegetables sold in Ghana are largely dependent on the quality of water used for irrigation. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 17; Correspondence Address: E.

Population and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated positive correlations between PFOA levels and human health problems. Objectives: Many studies have focused on the hepatotoxicity and liver problems caused by PFOA, with little attention to remediation of these problems. As an antioxidant, vitamin C is frequently utilized as a supplement for hepatic detoxification. Methods: In this study, we use a mouse model to study the possible role of vitamin C in reducing PFOA-induced liver damage. Based on comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of vitamin C. Results: Our results show that vitamin C supplementation reduces signs of PFOA-induced liver damage including total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase, liver damage markers aspartate, transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase elevation, and liver enlargement. Further, we show that the protective role of vitamin C is associated with signaling networks control, suppressing linoleic acid metabolism, reducing thiodiglycolic acid, and elevating glutathione in the liver. Conclusion: The findings in this study demonstrate, for the first time, the utility of vitamin C for preventing PFOA-induced hepatotoxicity. © 2021","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: Z.

Heterogeneous catalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-H) mediated by iron-based materials has been explored by previous researches. Yet, unknown role and degradation mechanism of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-H) through S-nZVI driven peroxymonosulfate (PMS) need to be further investigated. In current research, the impacts of S-nZVI dosage, PMS dosage, initial pH, anions and humic acids were independently explored during TC-H degradation process. S-nZVI exhibited the high efficiency for activating PMS. TC-H degradation followed a pseudo-first order kinetics reaction with kobs at 0.1403 min−1. HA, Cl−, HPO42−, NO3− exhibited varied reduction of the reaction rates on TC-H removal. Besides, SO4•− and •OH were dedicated to degrading TC-H, and SO4•− was proved to be predominant one. The alteration of sulfide species from XPS analysis played a pivotal role in raising the electron transfer rate to improve TC-H degradation. Ten intermediates products were determined through HRMS and primary transformation mechanism involved in N-demethylation reaction, demethylation reaction, elimination reaction and hydrogenation reaction were proposed. Based on metabolomics analysis, up-regulated expression of carbohydrate metabolism, citrate cycle, CoA biosynthesis, fatty acid degradation and amino acid synthesis in Escherichia coli were significantly induced by the further products, whereas glutathione metabolism was significantly down-regulated, endorsing that potential toxicity induced by intermediates were weakened.

PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the ‘grey literature’. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by full-text screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist. We will collect information on conflict-of-interest statements, funding sources and availability of raw data and analysis code. We will extract relevant data from full texts and bibliographic records, conduct bibliometric analyses, and display findings as tables, figures and a narrative synopsis. © 2021 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.

Hence, there are major incentives for developing minimally invasive methods for lead isotope analysis that are accurate and precise enough to reveal historical information about artefacts and their origin. Portable laser ablation (pLA), collecting microscopic samples on Teflon filters, has four key benefits. It produces no visual impact to the artefacts, does not require transport of artefacts to laboratory facilities, there are no artefact size restrictions, and samples are processed under clean laboratory conditions allowing Pb purification prior to measurement by solution MC-ICPMS. To validate the efficacy of the pLA technique on silver, nine matrixed-matched commercial, in-house and archaeological reference materials were sampled and analysed multiple times (9-10). The pLA mean analyses (±2SD) were all consistent with inter-laboratory bulk analyses. The digestion of sample filters produces precisions that are consistently more than five-times better than in situ nsLA-MC-ICPMS and are the same order of magnitude expected for bulk samples processed in different laboratories.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score =  6.20, p < 0.001), PFOS (z-score =  3.55, p < 0.001), and PFNA (z-score =  2.27, p = 0.023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10092.",,10.1289/EHP10092,Biomarkers;*Environmental Pollutants;*Fluorocarbons;Humans;*Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease;United States,35475652,PMC9044977,exposure to per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and markers of liver injury a systematic review and metaanalysis

However, the regional and temporal differences, in addition to the predictors of therapy failure, are unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the prevalence of treatment failure in patients with scabies and investigation of associated factors. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 2021 for randomized and quasi-randomized trials, in addition to observational studies that enrolled children or adults diagnosed with confirmed or clinical scabies treated with permethrin, ivermectin, crotamiton, benzyl benzoate, malathion, sulfur or lindane, and measured treatment failure or factors associated with treatment failure. We performed a random effects meta-analysis for all outcomes reported by at least two studies. RESULTS: A total of 147 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. The overall prevalence of treatment failure was 15.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-17.6; I2 = 95.3%, moderate-certainty evidence] with regional differences between World Health Organization regions (P = 0.003) being highest in the Western Pacific region (26.9%, 95% CI 14.5-41.2). Oral ivermectin (11.8%, 95% CI 8.4-15.4), topical ivermectin (9.3%, 95% CI 5.1-14.3) and permethrin (10.8%, 95% CI 7.5-14.5) had relatively lower failure prevalence compared with the overall prevalence. Failure prevalence was lower in patients treated with two doses of oral ivermectin (7.1%, 95% CI 3.1-12.3) compared with those treated with one dose (15.2%, 95% CI 10.8-20.2; P = 0.021). Overall and permethrin treatment failure prevalence in the included studies (1983-2021) increased by 0.27% and 0.58% per year, respectively. Only three studies conducted a multivariable risk factor analysis; no studies assessed resistance. CONCLUSIONS: A second dose of ivermectin showed lower failure prevalence than single-dose ivermectin, which should be considered in all guidelines. The increase in treatment failure over time hints at decreasing mite susceptibility for several drugs, but reasons for failure are rarely assessed. Ideally, scabicide susceptibility testing should be implemented in future studies.",,10.1093/bjd/ljad308,"Adult;Child;Humans;*Scabies/drug therapy;Ivermectin;Permethrin/therapeutic use;Hexachlorocyclohexane/therapeutic use;Malathion/therapeutic use;Administration, Oral",37625798,,failure of scabies treatment a systematic review and metaanalysis

However, the impact of PFAS on cardiovascular diseases remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the impact of PFAS on the stroke risk. CONTENT: Databases were searched for studies published up to November 1, 2022, which report the association between stroke and exposure to at least one of four main PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS], perfluorononanoic acid [PFNA], and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid [PFHxS]). Data extraction and quality assessment were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: Four studies were included in this systematic review. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident stroke per 1-log unit increment in each serum PFAS were combined in the meta-analysis. The risk of development of stroke was not significantly associated with PFOA, PFOS, or PFNA exposure (PFOA: pooled odds ratio [OR]=1.001, 95 % confidence interval [CI]=0.975-1.028, p=0.934; PFOS: pooled OR=0.994, 95 % CI=0.972-1.017, p=0.601; PFNA: pooled OR=1.016, 95 % CI=0.920-1.123, p=0.752), whereas a moderately lower risk was associated with PFHxS exposure without statistical significance (pooled OR=0.953, 95 % CI=0.908-1.001, p=0.054). PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA exposure showed a neutral association, while PFHxS showed a possible inverse association with the risk of stroke. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution. Further prospective observational studies with PFAS mixture analyses are warranted.",,10.1515/reveh-2023-0021,,37656598,,exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risk of stroke in adults a metaanalysis

Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of  ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA's Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement-only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with  ≥ 21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the  ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10343.",,10.1289/EHP10343,"Animals;Databases, Factual;Epidemiologic Studies;*Fluorocarbons/analysis;Humans;Mammals;Reproduction;United States;United States Environmental Protection Agency",35580034,PMC9113544,systematic evidence map for over one hundred and fifty per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas

Prenatal PFAS exposures may confer risk for pregnancy-related outcomes such as hypertensive and metabolic disorders, preterm birth, and impaired fetal development through intermediate metabolic and inflammation pathways. OBJECTIVE: Estimate associations between maternal pregnancy PFAS exposure (individually and as a mixture) and bioactive lipids. METHODS: Our study included pregnant women in the Environmental influences on Child Health Outcomes Program: Chemicals in our Bodies cohort (CiOB, n=73), Illinois Kids Developmental Study (IKIDS, n=287), and the ECHO-PROTECT cohort (n=54). We measured twelve PFAS in serum and 50 plasma bioactive lipids (parent fatty acids and eicosanoids derived from cytochrome p450, lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenase) during pregnancy (median 17 gestational weeks). Pairwise associations across cohorts were estimated using linear mixed models and meta-analysis. Associations between the PFAS mixture and individual bioactive lipids were estimated using quantile g-computation. RESULTS: PFDeA, PFOA, and PFUdA were associated (p<0.05) with changes in bioactive lipid levels in all three enzymatic pathways (cyclooxygenase [n=6 signatures]; cytochrome p450 [n=5 signatures]; lipoxygenase [n=7 signatures]) in at least one combined cohort analysis. The strongest signature indicated that a doubling in PFOA corresponded with a 24.3% increase (95% CI [7.3%, 43.9%]) in PGD2 (cyclooxygenase pathway) in the combined cohort. In the mixtures analysis, we observed nine positive signals across all pathways associated with the PFAS mixture. The strongest signature indicated that a quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was associated with a 34% increase in PGD2 (95% CI [8%, 66%]), with PFOS contributing most to the increase. CONCLUSIONS: Bioactive lipids were revealed as biomarkers of PFAS exposure and could provide mechanistic insights into PFAS' influence on pregnancy outcomes, informing more precise risk estimation and prevention strategies.",,10.1101/2023.11.03.23297930,,37961525,PMC10635258,crosssectional associations between prenatal maternal per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and bioactive lipids in three environmental influences on child health outcomes echo cohorts

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched and checked for studies using Sonazoid CEUS to characterize HCC. A comprehensive meta-analysis was conducted, involving data pooling, subgroup analyses, meta-regression, and investigation of publication bias. RESULTS: The meta-analysis included fourteen studies. The overall diagnostic accuracy for characterizing HCC was as follows (all ranges show the 95% confidence interval): pooled sensitivity of 0.87 (0.80-0.92), pooled specificity of 0.95 (0.91-0.97), and a diagnostic odds ratio of 121 (61-241). The overall weighted area under the curve was 0.97 (0.95-0.98).

Al-NPs can enter plants through different pathways and accumulate in various tissues, leading to alter plant growth and development. Al-NPs also affected root, shoot, and leaf characteristics as well as changing nutrient uptake and distribution and inducing oxidative stress via excess reactive radical generation, thereby impairing plant defense systems. Additionally, Al-NPs altered gene expression, which involved in various signaling pathways and metabolic processes in plants, that further altered plants susceptible or tolerant to stressors.

While some pollutants are well studied, there are little or no data on the potential health effects for many thousands of chemicals that can make their way into the environment, such as PFAS. EPA still relies on laboratory mammalian studies as the foundation of most human health risk assessments, which are limited by high costs, long timelines, and other concerns. New approach methods (NAMs) in toxicology, for example new in vivo and in vitro strategies and computational systems biology, offer opportunities to inform timely decision-making when no data are available from laboratory mammalian toxicity tests or epidemiological studies. NAMs may also help inform efforts to protect susceptible and vulnerable populations by characterizing subtle health perturbations, better encompassing genetic diversity, and accounting for nonchemical stressors. While the promise and need for NAMs is clear, many barriers to their use remain. This report aims to bridge the gap between the potential of NAMs and their practical application in human health risk assessment. Building Confidence in New Evidence Streams for Human Health Risk Assessment draws lessons learned from laboratory mammalian toxicity tests to help inform approaches for building scientific confidence in NAMs and for incorporating such data into risk assessment and decision-making. Overall, the report recommendations aim to ensure a seamless handoff from the evaluation of NAM-based testing strategies in the laboratory to the incorporation of NAM data into modern, systematic-review-based risk assessments.",,10.17226/26906,,37579039,,

OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to (1) characterize the landscape of PFD disparities literature using the 3 phases of disparities research framework, (2) describe the characteristics of PFD disparities studies, and (3) identify critical knowledge gaps. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications addressing disparities in PFDs among U.S. populations from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, or the Cochrane Database indexed between 1997 and 2022. Using the triphasic framework for advancing health disparities research by Kilbourne et al (Am J Public Health. 2006;96(12):2113-21), we categorized the included studies into the detecting phase (identifies and measures disparities in historically marginalized populations), understanding phase (establishes disparity determinants), or reducing phase (conducts interventions to alleviate inequities). All screening, coding, and quality reviews were independently performed by at least 2 authors. We used descriptive analysis and the χ2 test for comparisons. RESULTS: The initial search identified 10,178 studies, of which 123 were included. Of the included studies, 98 (79.7%), 22 (17.9%), and 3 (2.4%) studies were detecting, understanding, and reducing phase research, respectively. The most common disparity category investigated was race and ethnicity (104 studies), and one third of these studies attributed drivers of racial and ethnic differences to structural influences.

The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023428013). The review spanned studies published between 1974 and 2023, identified through an extensive literature search on databases like MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, the Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialized Register, Scopus, and Web of Science. Distiller SR software was used to assess study quality and extract the outcome data. The NTP-OHAT scale assessed evidence quality, and case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies in English were included. Comprehensively reviewing 5287 articles resulted in 29 studies being included in the final analysis, comprising 15 cross-sectional, seven case-control, and seven cohort studies. All 29 studies qualified for qualitative analysis. Eleven studies analyzed lead (Pb) effects on health outcomes, four analyzed manganese (Mn), and 14 investigated other element groups.

Nine studies concluded that PwCF had a higher prevalence of enamel defects than control people and one study found no difference in cystic fibrosis (CF) status. All studies had a risk of bias that may influence study results and their interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the systematic review show a consistent pattern that PwCF have a higher prevalence of DDE than people without CF. Genetic dysfunction, chronic systemic infections, and long-term antibiotic use are possible aetiological causes. This review highlights the need for future studies to investigate if DDEs are caused by the underlying CFTR mutation or as a consequence of disease manifestations and/or management.",,10.1186/s12903-024-04227-4,,38609911,PMC11015619,the prevalence of developmental defects of enamel in people with cystic fibrosis a systematic review

BACKGROUND: Multiple biomaterials, both novel and combinations of pre-existing materials are employed in patch repair of large size CDH. METHODS: Literature search was performed across Embase, Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science. Publications that explicitly reported patch repair, material used and recurrences following CDH repair were selected. RESULTS: Sixty-three papers were included, presenting data on 4598 patients of which 1811 (39.4%) were managed using 19 types of patches. Goretex® (GTX) (n=1259) was the most frequently employed patch followed by Surgisis® (n=164), Dualmesh® (n=114), Marlex®/GTX® (n=56), Tutoplast dura® (n=40), Dacron® (n=34), Dacron®/GTX® (n=32), Permacol® (n=24), Teflon® (n=24), Surgisis®/GTX® (n=15), Sauvage® Filamentous Fabric (n=13), Marlex® (n=9), Alloderm® (n=8), Silastic® (n=4), Collagen coated Vicryl® mesh (CCVM) (n=1), Mersilene® (n=1), and MatriStem® (n=1) Biomaterials were further subgrouped as: Synthetic non-resorbable (SNOR) (n=1458), Natural-resorbable (NR) (n=249), Combined natural and synthetic non-resorbable (NSNOR) (n=103), and Combined natural and synthetic resorbable (NSR) (n=1). Overall recurrence rate for patch repair was 16.8% (n=305). For patch types with n>20, recurrence rate was lowest in GTX/Marlex (3.6%), followed by Teflon (4.2%), Dacron (5.6%), GTX (13.8%), Permacol (16.0%), Tutoplast Dura (17.5%), Dualmesh (20.2%), SIS/GTX (26.7%), SIS (36.6%), and Dacron/GTX (37.5%).When analysed by biomaterial groups, recurrence was highest in NSR (100%), followed by NR (32.9%), NSNOR (17.5) and SNOR the least (14.0%). CONCLUSION: In this cohort, over one-third of CDH were closed using patches. To date, 19 patch types/variations have been employed for CDH closure. GTX is the most popular, employed in 70% of patients; however excluding smaller cohorts (n<20) GTX/Marlex is associated with the lowest recurrence rate (3.6%). SNOR was the material type least associated with recurrence while NSR experienced recurrence in every instance.",,10.1097/SLA.0000000000006256,,38450531,,patches in congenital diaphragmatic hernia a systematic review

METHODS: A systematic search strategy was conducted of studies published between January 2000 and October 2022. Included studies reported on either the safety or efficacy of two or more drainage methods during PPV for RRD patients. RESULTS: Two randomized and five observational studies consisting of 1524 eyes were included. Best corrected visual acuity at last study observation and primary reattachment rate were similar across groups. A significantly lower risk of epiretinal membrane formation (ERM) was associated with draining subretinal fluid through pre-existing retinal breaks (PRB) (RR= 0.70, 95% CI=[0.60, 0.83], p=<0.01, I2=0%) or with perfluorocarbon liquid (PFCL) (RR=0.70, 95% CI=[0.59, 0.83], p=<0.01, I2=0%) compared to posterior retinotomy (PR). The risk of an abnormal foveal contour was significantly greater in PFCL-treated eyes relative to PR (RR=1.56, 95% CI=[1.13, 2.17], p=<0.01, I2=0%). CONCLUSIONS: No significant differences were observed in final BCVA at last study observation and primary reattachment rates across different drainage methods.

Although of great importance to soil biogeochemical processes, how plastics influence soil microbes have yet to be systematically studied. The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate whether plastics lead to divergent responses of soil microbial community parameters, and explore the potential driving factors. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 710 paired observations from 48 published articles to quantify the impact of plastic on the diversity, biomass, and functionality of soil microbial communities. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This study indicated that plastics accelerated soil organic carbon loss (effect size = -0.05, p = 0.004) and increased microbial functionality (effect size = 0.04, p = 0.003), but also reduced microbial biomass (effect size = -0.07, p < 0.001) and the stability of co-occurrence networks. Polyethylene significantly reduced microbial richness (effect size = -0.07, p < 0.001) while polypropylene significantly increased it (effect size = 0.17, p < 0.001). Degradable plastics always had an insignificant effect on the microbial community. The effect of the plastic amount on microbial functionality followed the ""hormetic dose-response"" model, the infection point was about 40 g/kg. Approximately 3564.78 μm was the size of the plastic at which the response of microbial functionality changed from positive to negative. Changes in soil pH, soil organic carbon, and total nitrogen were significantly positively correlated with soil microbial functionality, biomass, and richness (R(2) = 0.04-0.73, p < 0.05). The changes in microbial diversity were decoupled from microbial community structure and functionality. We emphasize the negative impacts of plastics on soil microbial communities such as microbial abundance, essential to reducing the risk of ecological surprise in terrestrial ecosystems. Our comprehensive assessment of plastics on soil microbial community parameters deepens the understanding of environmental impacts and ecological risks from this emerging pollution.",,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1258606,,37901816,PMC10601715,soil microbial community parameters affected by microplastics and other plastic residues

The identification of EDs require a substantial amount of data, both in vitro and in vivo, due to the current scientific criteria in the EU. At the same time, the EU strives to reduce animal testing due to concerns regarding animal welfare and sensitivity of animal studies to adequately detect adverse effects relevant for human health. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) is a persistent organic pollutant that is suspected to be an ED based on academic research, however it is not identified as such from a regulatory perspective. It has previously been shown that PFOS has the potential to cause neurotoxicity as well as affect the thyroid system, and it is known that specific thyroid hormone levels are critical in the development of the brain during. In this work, the aim was to evaluate a mechanism-based approach to identify ED properties of PFOS based on the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework and using New Approach Methods (NAMs), by comparing this approach to an ED assessment based on the currently available guidance document. An AOP network (AOPN) was generated for the thyroid modality, and AOPs leading to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) were identified. A literature search and screening process based on the AOPN, and systematic review methodology, was performed, followed by a rigorous Weight-of-Evidence (WoE) assessment. Evidence was mapped back onto the AOPN used for the literature search, to identify possible endocrine Modes-of-Action (MoAs) for PFOS and data gaps in the two assessments. It could be concluded that PFOS fulfils the criteria for ED classification in the standard ED assessment, but not in the mechanism-based assessment. The need for quantitative information, such as quantitative AOPs, for the mechanism-based approach is discussed. The possibility of a directly neurotoxic alternative MoA was also highlighted based on available in vitro data. Opportunities and challenges with implementing AOPs and NAMs into the regulatory assessment of EDs, and assessing hazard in the Next Generation Risk Assessment, is discussed. This case study exploring the mechanism-based approach to ED identification represents an important step toward more accurate and predictive assessment of EDs based on AOPs and NAMs, and to the Next Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA) concept.",,10.1016/j.tox.2024.153794,,38580097,,exploring a mechanismbased approach for the identification of endocrine disruptors using adverse outcome pathways aops and new approach methodologies nams a perfluorooctane sulfonic acid case study

Over 1400 research articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of this test. METHODS: The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects-mainly from a patient-perspective. RESULTS: A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? CONCLUSIONS: Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results.",,10.1186/s13039-022-00612-2,,35986330,PMC9392255,falsepositives and falsenegatives in noninvasive prenatal testing nipt what can we learn from a metaanalyses on > 750000 tests
