rayyan-1259294646,Endogenous and Exogenous Estrogens on Biochemical and Performance Indicators of Exercise Induced Muscle Damage in Users and Non-Users of Oral Contraceptives,2019,1,1,,,NA,NA,,"Flanagan, Emily White",, English,,,"It has been proposed that endogenous estrogens may protect skeletal muscle integrity and promote the repair and recovery process after acute muscle damage. The purpose of this study was to examine both biochemical and performance indices of exercise-induced muscle damage (EiMD) across menstrual cycle phases and compare oral contraceptive pill users (OCP) and eumenorrheic non-users (EUC). A total of 12 women (5 EUC; 7 OCP) underwent a prolonged eccentric running EiMD protocol and were evaluated for biochemical markers of skeletal muscle damage including creatine kinase (CK), C-reactive protein (hsCRP), and myoglobin (MgB) as well as performance markers including strength, range of motion (ROM), soreness perception, and swelling during early follicular (EF), late follicular (LF), and luteal (LU) phases. Measurements were taken pre- and post-exercise and at 24, 48, and 72 h post exercise. No differences were observed in ROM, swelling, or pain perception in response to EiMD across menstrual cycle phases. The EUC and OCP groups showed similar increases in CK, MgB, and soreness perception in response to EiMD across menstrual cycle phases. Strength recovery differed across menstrual cycle phases and between the EUC and OCP groups (p=0.011), being optimal in phases with higher endogenous estrogen levels (LF and LU). We conclude that endogenous estrogens produced during the natural menstrual cycle may support improved strength recovery, despite immediate increases in muscle cell damage, regardless of oral contraceptive pill use.",,,Estrogens,NA,,endogenous and exogenous estrogens on biochemical and performance indicators of exercise induced muscle damage in users and nonusers of oral contraceptives

However, in developing countries such as Ghana- one of the top pesticide users and highest POP emitters in sub-saharan Africa. Although the focus has primarily been on determination of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) in environmental matrices, there is limited information on how POP concentrations have changed, post ratification of the Stockholm Convention. In addition, human exposure data, on dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (DLCs)- one of the toxic classes of POPs in Ghana are limited. The purposes of this research were to: 1) Identify considerations for future research prioritization based on knowledge gaps from previously completed studies by collating available data that reported on POPs in Ghana. 2) Identify spatial and temporal POP trends in Ghana, and establish potential health risks 3) Quantify background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in sera of primiparous Ghanaians, and in breastmilk of Ghanaian lactating mothers, in addition to infant dietary exposure to dioxins and DLCs in breastmilk. The dissertation is divided into two main sections: The first part presents a comprehensive and systematic review on the Stockholm POPs previously studied in Ghana to date. The second part focuses on the use of modified analytical sample preparation methods and instrumentations to determine background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in Ghanaian human tissues, using gas chromatography with atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (GC-APCI-MS/MS) in Ghanaian human tissues. The first part of this work entails a systematic and comprehensive review of data on sample collection, preparation and analytical methods from previous studies undertaken on the Stockholm POPs in Ghana, since 2001. A review was conducted on POPs in different matrices: environmental and humans, a comparison of concentration against relevant health criteria, and a discussion on spatial and temporal trends. The purposes of this work were to determine whether POPs were increasing or decreasing in the Ghanaian environment, and to ascertain knowledge gaps in data, as the focus has heavily been on the environment, with limited/sporadic studies in humans. This review identified a need to assess exposures to toxic classes of POPs in vulnerable populations, including lactating mothers, pregnant women, and occupationally exposed workers. Results obtained from data analyses of previous studies showed concentrations in excess of United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) regulatory standards for per- and poly-fluoroalkyl sulphonates (PFASs) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (DDD) in water, polychlorinated and polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs and PBDD/Fs) in e-waste soils, and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) in aquatic organisms and dairy products. The published studies do not cover major regions nationwide. The inconsistency in methods and analytes measured, along with data scarcity in some regions, makes it challenging to identify temporal trends. However, decreasing concentrations of some legacy POPs in soil/sediment and aquatic organisms, with increasing concentrations of some POPs were reported in water, fish, fruits and vegetables. Studies that performed health risk assessments were limited although environmental and human data indicated elevated health risks to e-waste workers, some farmers and vulnerable sub-populations. This review identified potential human health risks from POPs in the Ghanaian environment and the need for more consistent and widespread monitoring program. Following recommendations from the first part of this research, the second part focuses on assessing Ghanaian human exposure to some of the toxic classes of POPs including dioxins and DLCs. An analytical sample separation method was developed that can be used for determination of low, background concentrations of dioxins and DLCs in human serum and breastmilk. Previously established methods utilized multiple fractionation steps and clean-up procedures on expensive equipment, such as the Power-prep sample clean-up instrument. Thus, a manual sample extraction and clean-up method for analysis of low level DLCs in breastmilk and serum was developed for application in developing. The target analytes included detection of 17 congeners of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PCDD/Fs), 12 congeners of 8 mono-ortho and 4 non-ortho coplanar or dioxin-like PCBs (dlPCBs), 7 congeners of polybrominated dibenzo-p-dioxins and dibenzofurans (PBDD/Fs), and 7 congeners of mixed halogenated dibenzo-p-dioxins and furans (PXDD/Fs, where X=Br or Cl). Method validation was completed on the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Standard Reference Material 1958 (NIST 1958) serum samples. The analytical method provided for low limits of detection (LODs) in the femtogram levels (fg), with analytes recoveries ranging between 41.8-129.9 % for the classes of POPs studied (dlPCBs, PCDD/Fs, PBDD/Fs and PXDD/Fs) in both serum and breastmilk samples.

A series of complexes were prepared and characterized. The neutral co-ligands tetrahydrofuran and dimethoxyethane are introduced as both solvents and Lewis basic donors. Ligand size effects are examined with the introduction of the bulkier azobenzene derivatives MesN=NPh and MesN=NMes (Mes = 2,4,6-Me 3 C 6 H 2 ). The fine structure details obtained by single crystal X-ray diffraction allowed for the systematic study of primary ligand coordination modes, the quantity and mode of co-ligand coordination, and, finally, the nature and extent of secondary interactions, with respect to trends in metal size. We are able to closely examine the factors present that impart additional stabilization to these highly reactive species. In the latter part of this thesis, with a focus on MOCVD applications, the perfluoro-t-butoxide (PFTB) ligand is used to prepare a set of novel bismuth alkoxides. These complexes were compared to other bismuth alkoxides and early lanthanide alkoxides in both their structural and thermal properties. Using an adaptation of a previously published pathway, a number of novel bismuth compounds have been synthesized; this synthetic route has since been shown to be fruitful herein and results have been obtained with a related ligand system by a colleague.

It can greatly affect physical, psychological and social health of people. The lack of evidence-based psychosocial interventions and emergency preparedness contribute to the barriers of integrating psychological interventions into the routine disaster preparedness and relief protocols. Pre-deployment Psychological First Aid (PFA) is a model widely used and adopted as a community-based public health disaster response intervention. PFA training was evaluated in this thesis for its relevancy, impact, and feasibility of implementation with emergency responders. Four studies were conducted in this thesis to explore the applicability of PFA as a public health disaster response and preparedness strategy for responders in critical incidents. The first study, systematic reviews of the PFA application and training, provided emerging evidence of the impact of the field applications and trainings of PFA as an immediate post-disaster public mental health intervention. The second study was a randomized controlled trial of 802 community-based volunteer disaster responders to evaluate the effectiveness of PFA training in preparing responders with relevant skills to cope with and offer assistance in disaster settings. Results from 3-month and 6-month follow up analyses revealed that PFA training enhances responders self-efficacy to provide emotional comfort to survivors. However, no conclusive results on other mental health protective and promotion impacts on responders were observed in this study. On the other hand, in the third study, a post-deployment cross-sectional study in a field setting, conducted two months after a major maritime accident in Hong Kong showed more promising results. It investigated the effectiveness of pre-disaster training of PFA, in provision of emotional support to victims and first responders post-disaster mental health, among PFA-trained and non-trained responders. This was the first study to demonstrate the potential beneficial impact of PFA training to responders own mental health, including better coping, resilience, life satisfaction and perceived social support from friends. Trained PFA responders also showed better capacity to provide support in disasters, as shown by higher disaster mental health and PFA knowledge and self-efficacy in offering emotional support to survivors. Stakeholders interviews with representatives in disaster responding non-governmental organizations were conducted to examine the mental health needs of frontline workers, current agency psychosocial policies and barriers encountered, and relevancy of PFA and its training to frontline workers field experience. Results showed that most of the organizations with disasters responding mandates had inadequate measures to mitigate the adverse effects of critical incidents among the frontline workers. Nevertheless, all these stakeholders regarded PFA as a highly relevant and valuable measure to address the mental needs of the aid workers. Given the devastating impact of disasters, this study series provided the evidence that PFA is a relevant and feasible tool to equip first responders with skills that might be beneficial for promoting their mental health and self-care when engaging in disaster response work. Organization should consider adopting PFA as a pre-deployment training option into the current field deployment practices. Future research implications and implementation strategies in post-disaster mental health intervention and preparedness strategies were also discussed.",,,Disasters,NA,,psychological first aid as a public health disaster response preparedness strategy for responders in critical incidents and disasters

As Ontario has the largest population in Canada, it also has great disparities in colorectal cancer incidence. The region of Timiskaming has the highest incidence for colorectal cancer, while the region of Peel has the lowest incidence for colorectal cancer in Ontario. The purpose of this study is to identify the dominant non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors in the region of Timiskaming compared to the region of Peel that may be associated with diverging colorectal cancer incidence rates. The three objectives of the study included performing a systematic review on available published literature, creating an assessment questionnaire tool regarding environmental exposures, and utilizing the questionnaire assessment tool within a pilot study group while expanding it into the communities of interest. Findings indicate that there are dominant non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors in the regions of Timiskaming and Peel that may be associated with colorectal cancer. The dominant factors identified are tobacco/smoking, alcohol use, pesticides/organochlorines, and metal toxins. Following this study, it is imperative that recommendations are directed at a community level and relate to the assessment of potential non-nutritional modifiable environmental risk factors. Future research should accompany a larger sample size, multiple participant communities, and catering of the questionnaire tool towards the communities of interest.

In order to lower anodic polarization losses in anode-supported SOFCs, a novel composite anode functional layer (AFL) having bimodal (nano/micro) structure was developed. Application of this AFL involved a simple process where a precursor solution was coated onto a conventional submicron sized colloidally-deposited Ni-GDC AFL. Cells prepared in this manner yielded maximum power densities (MPD) of 1.29, 1.16, 0.7 and 0.38 W/cm 2 at 650, 600, 550 and 500°C, respectively. Electrochemical impedance results showed a striking decrease in both ohmic and non-ohmic area specific resistances (ASRs) for these cells compared to those with either no AFL, or a conventional AFL. In addition, the effect composition of the conventional submironsized AFL on performance was examined. The highest MPD (1.15 W/cm 2 at 650°C) was achieved at a composition of 60wt% NiO. This composition had the best performance over the intermediate temperature range (450 to 650°C). For the potentio-static test, the cell exhibited stable performance over 200 hrs of operation at 1.1 W/cm 2 . It was also revealed that electrode ASR has an inverse linear relationship with maximum power density at 650°C. To better understand the effect of AFL composition, microstructural features of AFLs having various Ni-GDC compositions were quantified by a 3 dimensional (3D) reconstruction technique using a FIB/SEM dual beam system. Of the compositions tested, the highest triple phase boundary (TPB) density was achieved at 60wt% NiO, which corresponds to a 1:1 volume ratio of Ni to GDC phase. The quantified TPB density showed an inverse proportionality to electrode ASR. Using a wet chemical co-precipitation method, nano-sized ESB particles were successfully synthesized at temperatures as low as ? 500°C. Due to the high sinterability of this powder, a dense erbia stabilized bismuth oxide (ESB) layer was successfully formed on a gadolinia doped ceria (GDC) electrolyte by a simple colloidal coating method. A systematic study on the sintering behavior of ESB was conducted to determine the optimum sintering conditions for these materials. I-V measurement a cell using this bilayered electrolyte sytem showed a high power density (? 1.5 W/cm 2 ) at 650°C due to an enhancement in OCP and a significant reduction in ASR when compared to a GDC single cell. The performance of conventional (La 0.80 Sr 0.20 )MnO 3-? (LSM) cathodes were dramatically improved at the IT range by combining it with a highly conductive ESB phase. The electrode ASR measured from a symmetric cell consisting of LSM-ESB electrodes on an ESB electrolyte was only 0.08 ?-cm 2 at 700°C which is ?60% lower than that of LSM-ESB on GDC electrolytes (0.19 ?-cm 2 ). This exemplifies the synergetic effect the ESB phase has both in the cathode bulk and at the electrolyte/electrode interface. The MPDs of the anode-supported SOFCs with LSM-ESB cathodes on ESB/GDC bilayered electrolytes were ?836 mW/cm 2 at 650°C, which is the highest value reported for SOFCs using LSM-bismuth oxide composite cathodes.",,,,NA,,comprehensive development of high performance solid oxide fuel cells for intermediate and low temperature applications

The latter was monitored with coupled multi-electrode arrays (CMEA). Tests were also conducted in several HCO 3 - , SO 4 2- and Cl - containing-waters with systematic variations in the concentrations of these species. Empirical equations that forecast pitting (E Pit ) and repassivation (E Rp ) potential as a function of selected water chemistry variables were developed. OCP was a strong function of water chemistry, pH and time. Maximum OCPs were found to increase with both pH and Cl 2 . Empirical equations that forecast the OCP as a function of pH and Cl 2 were also developed. Natural pitting was tested in different pH synthetic waters (6-10) at various Cl 2 levels (0-5 ppm). The CMEA method successfully detected the formation of persistent anodes (pitting sites) in pH ?7 synthetic waters compared to formation of switchable anodes at pH 6. A pitting factor was determined as a function of water chemistry. Pit events were statistically analyzed and potential excursions were compared to E Pit and E Rp . Natural pitting events occurred on a percentage of electrodes once the OCP rose above E Rp and this could be rationalized based on the statistical spread in E Pit . Pits stopped growing once the OCP dropped below E Rp Pitting severity increased with Cl 2 level and pH. The cathodic capacity of adjacent cathodic sites as a function of water chemistry and the nature of the cathodic sites was also factored into this analysis. Lastly, the possible roles of deposited aluminum solids in pit initiation were also examined using several diagnostic methods.",,,Copper,NA,,understanding the interplay between water chemistry and electrochemical properties of copper

Box 1764, Ann Arbor, MI, 48106, USA",,"A method for the congener-specific analysis of multiple classes of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) has been developed. It consists of high-speed blending extraction, automated FMS cleanup/fractionation or GPC-Florisil cleanup, and final determination by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Fifty-five 13 C(12)- or 2 H-labeled compounds were used as surrogates to evaluate the analytical efficiency. Proper polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB) and polybrominated biphenyl (PBB) congeners were used as internal standards to monitor the GC performance. Potential GC-MS chromatographic interferences were studied. The method was demonstrated to be reproducible, effective, and reliable and was applied successfully to determine POP concentrations in northwestern Atlantic harbor seal (Phoca vitulina concolor) blubber samples. PCBs and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) account for more than 95% of the POP contamination, while non-ortho- and mono-ortho- substituted PCBs are the principal contributors to the total toxic equivalents (TEQs) in seal blubber. Four non-ortho- and eight mono-ortho-substituted PCBs are potent inducers of hepatic aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH). Therefore, evaluation of their environmental behaviors in terms of their physicochemical characteristics, such as Henry's Law constant (HLC), is very important. A modified gas purging technique was used to determine HLCs for these 12 PCBs. Measured HLCs range from 5.6 to 21.8 Pa*m 3 /mol and they are comparable with literature values. Meta-analysis technique and principal component regression (PCR) was applied to model the relationship between experimentally-determined HLCs for 97 PCBs and the congeners'structures. Results suggest that HLCs for PCB are primarily affected by meta-chlorine substitution and chlorine substitution on the biphenyl ring generally leads to smaller HLCs. The PCR-predicted HLCs are in good agreement with the experimental values and the predicted HLCs by a complicated partial least-square regression (PLSR) model using the molecular connectivity index as predictor. Finally, photocatalytic degradation of 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl was conducted in the TiO(2) aqueous suspensions. 4,4'-dichlorobiphenyl degradation follows the Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetic model. Three hydroxylated byproducts, 4,4'-dichloro-2-biphenyl-ol, 4-chloro-4'-bipenyl-ol, and 4,4'-dichloro-3-biphenyl-ol were identified and they underwent further photocatalytic decomposition. Kinetic modeling indicates that hydroxylation is the major pathway for PCB decomposition by UV/TiO(2).

Box 1764, Ann Arbor, MI, 48106, USA",,"High gain operational amplifiers are by far the most fundamental building block in analog and mixed-signal design. In the first few chapters, design of high gain CMOS positive feedback amplifiers (PFAs) is studied. A low-voltage positive feedback amplifier in standard digital CMOS with 70dB DC gain over a 2Vpp output swing range. Test results of fabricated chips confirmed better than 90dB operating-point DC gain, > =60dB DC gain over 2Vpp. It has nearly 90 degrees of phase margin and 140MHz gain-bandwidth product when driving 1pF capacitive load with 1mA from 3.5V single supply. Both linear and nonlinear behaviors of the PFA are carefully studied in order to enhance and maintain high gain automatically. Inherent nonlinearity in its DC transfer curve is discovered and analyzed. Based on nonlinear dynamic systems and bifurcation theory, we predict bifurcation and hysteresis phenomena in the PFA. An algorithm, which can be implemented using simple digital logic, is developed to measure the PFA's open-loop stability as the bifurcation parameter changes. Parameter-tuning algorithms are constructed that systematically move the amplifier's operational point towards the bifurcation point, at which infinite DC gain happens. In order to compensate for the PFA's high sensitivity to process and temperature variations, flexible analog design integrating digital programmability and inexpensive and adaptive digital post-processing techniques are developed. This flexibility and post-processing capability could dramatically enhance the PFA's yield. Full corner simulation results over wide temperature range verify the bifurcation phenomena and the effectiveness of the control algorithms. It is shown that this amplifier can maintain high performance in the most advanced digital CMOS technology at very low voltage supplies. They also demonstrate that the proposed approach offers a robust PFA design with both high yield and high performance. Matching of critical components is the most fundamental property that is necessary in achieving high linearity performance of analog mixed-signal circuits. Although matching qualities in future advanced digital CMOS technology are forecast to deteriorate as feature sizes continue to shrink, there has not been significant progress in developing advanced matching layout strategies. Chapter 4 is devoted to addressing this issue. In this chapter, systematic mismatch error in integrated circuits due to gradient effects is modeled and analyzed. Three layout strategies with improved matching performance are proposed and summarized. The hexagonal tessellation pattern can cancel quadratic gradient errors with only 3 units for each device and has high area-efficiency when extended. Both the N th -order circular symmetry patterns and N th -order central symmetry patterns can cancel up to N th order gradient effects between two devices using 2 N unit cells for each one. Among these three techniques, the central symmetry patterns have the best-reported matching performance for Manhattan structures; the circular-symmetry patterns have the best theoretical matching performance; and the hexagonal tessellation pattern has high density and high structural stability. The N th -order central symmetry technique is compatible to all IC fabrication processes requiring no special design rules. Simulation results of these proposed techniques show better matching characteristics than other existing layout techniques under nonlinear gradient effects. Specifically, two pairs of P-poly resistors using 2 nd and 3 rd -order central symmetry patterns were fabricated and tested. Less than 0.04% mismatch and less than 0.002% mismatch were achieved for the 2 nd and the 3 rd -order structures, respectively.

We examined individual and mixture associations of PFAS on liver function biomarkers in a representative sample of Canadian adults. We explored the potential for effect modification by sex and body mass index, as well as by physical activity level which may attenuate the deleterious effect of PFAS on metabolic disorders. Methods We analyzed data from participants aged 20-74 from the Canadian Health Measures Survey. We used linear regression to examine associations between plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUDA on serum concentrations of aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and total bilirubin. We used quantile g-computation to estimate associations with a PFAS mixture for each simultaneous, one-quartile change in PFAS concentrations. Results Each doubling of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, or PFNA concentrations was associated with higher AST, GGT, and ALP concentrations. Each doubling of PFOA concentrations was associated with 16.5\% (95\%CI: 10.4, 23.0) higher GGT concentrations among adults not meeting Canada's physical activity guidelines vs. 6.6\% (95\%CI: -1.6, 15.5) among those meeting these guidelines. Sex and BMI also modified some associations, though to a lesser extent. We did not observe associations between ALT and PFOA (1.2\% change; 95\%CI: -2.5, 4.9), PFOS (2.2\% change; 95\%CI: -0.8, 5.3), or PFHxS (1.5\% change; 95\%CI: -0.4, 3.4). We also did not observe consistent associations for PFDA and PFUDA or with total bilirubin. In quantile g-computation models, each simultaneous one-quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was positively associated with AST (7.5\% higher; 95\%CI: 4.0, 10.4), GGT (9.7\% higher; 95\%CI: 1.7, 17.0), and ALP (2.8\% higher; 95\%CI: 0.5, 5.4). Conclusion Higher plasma concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFHxS, and PFNA - both individually and as a mixture - were associated with higher serum concentrations of liver function biomarkers. These results contribute to emerging evidence suggesting that higher levels of physical activity appear to be protective against the hepatotoxic effects of PFOA.

Studies have shown that a single exposure to PFAS may provoke abnormal liver function; however, few studies have investigated the overall effect of PFAS mixtures. We aimed to investigate associations between exposure to PFAS mixtures and liver function indices and explore the relevant mechanisms. This study included 278 adult males from Guangzhou, China. Serum metabolite profiles were analyzed using untargeted metabolomics. We applied weighted quantile sum (WQS) regression as well as Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) to analyze the association of nine PFAS mixtures with 14 liver function indices. PFAS mixtures were positively associated with apolipoprotein B (APOB) and gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT) and negatively associated with direct bilirubin (DBIL) and total bilirubin (TBIL) in both the WQS and BKMR analyses. In addition, Spearman's correlation test showed individual PFAS correlated with APOB, GGT, TBIL, and DBIL, while there's little correlation between individual PFAS and other liver function indices. In linear regression analysis, PFHxS, PFOS, PFHpS, PFNA, PFDA, and PFUdA were associated with APOB; PFOA, PFDA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFUdA were associated with GGT. Subsequently, a metabolome-wide association study and mediation analysis were combined to explore metabolites that mediate these associations. The mechanisms linking PFAS to APOB and GGT are mainly related with amino acid and glycerophospholipid metabolism. High-dimensional mediation analysis showed that glycerophospholipids are the main markers of the association between PFAS and APOB, and that (R)-dihydromaleimide, Ile Leu, (R)-(+)-2pyrrolidone-5-carboxylic acid, and L-glutamate are the main markers of the association between PFAS and GGT. In summary, overall associations between PFAS and specific indices of liver function were found using two statistical methods; the metabolic pathways and markers identified here may serve to prompt more detailed study in animal-based systems, as well as a similar detailed analysis in other populations.",,10.1016/j.envint.2023.108405,Liver,NA,,overall and individual associations between per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and liver function indices and the metabolic mechanism

Every IQR increase of PFOA was significantly associated with a 2.1-mg/dL increase in TC (95\% CI: 1.2, 3.0), a 1.3-mg/dL increase in TGs (95\% CI: 0.1, 2.4), and a 1.4-mg/dL increase in LDL-C (95\% CI: 0.6, 2.2). PFOS was also significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels, and the corresponding values were 2.6 (95\% CI: 1.5, 3.6) and 1.9 (95\% CI: 0.9, 3.0), respectively. Associations of PFOS and PFOA with HDL-C levels were largely null. For minor PFAS species, PFHxS was significantly associated with higher levels of HDL-C {[}0.8 (95\% CI: 0.5, 1.2)]. Inverse associations were observed between PFDA and TGs {[}-5.0 (95\% CI: -8.1, -1.9)] and between PFNA and TGs {[}-1.7 (95\% CI: -3.5, -0.02)], whereas a positive association was observed between PFDA and HDL-C {[}1.4 (95\% CI: 0.1, 2.7)]. Nonsignificant nonlinear dose-response relationships were identified for associations of PFOA and PFOS with certain blood lipids.DISCUSSION: PFOA and PFOS were significantly associated with TC and LDL-C levels in adults. Whether these findings may translate into an ele-vated cardiovascular disease risk associated with PFAS exposure warrants further investigation. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP11840",,10.1289/EHP11840,,NA,,associations between per and polyfluoroalkyl substances exposures and blood lipid levels among adultsa metaanalysis

Data extraction and quality assessment were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Summary and outlook: Four studies were included in this systematic review. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident stroke per 1-log unit increment in each serum PFAS were combined in the meta-analysis. The risk of development of stroke was not significantly associated with PFOA, PFOS, or PFNA exposure (PFOA: pooled odds ratio {[}OR]=1.001, 95 \% confidence interval {[}CI]=0.975-1.028, p=0.752), whereas a moderately lower risk was associated with PFHxS exposure without statistical significance (pooled OR=0.953, 95 \% CI=0.908-1.001, p=0.054). PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA exposure showed a neutral association, while PFHxS showed a possible inverse association with the risk of stroke. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution.

Overall, the relationship between PFASs and hypertension risk remains controversial. We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between PFAS exposure and human risk of hypertension.We conducted a meta-analysis based on population-involving studies published from 1975 to 2023, which we collected from Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases.

Based on evidence from population epidemiological surveys, we conducted a meta-analysis following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to assess the correlation between PFASs exposure and hypertension. In this study, three databases of PubMed, Web of science, Embase were searched and 13 literatures with 81,096 participants were included. Literature heterogeneity was evaluated by I2 statistic, and the random effect model (I2 > 50\%) and fixed effect model (I2 < 50\%) were used to combine the studies in meta-analysis.

Objective: The goal of this systematic review was to determine the size of the association between a doubling in perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) serum concentration and difference in log(e) antibody concentration following a vaccine, with a focus on five PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorodecanoic acid (PFDA). Data source: We conducted online searches of PubMed and Web of Science through May 17, 2022 and identified 14 eligible reports published from 2012 to 2022. Study eligibility criteria, participants, and interventions: We included studies conducted in humans, including mother-child pairs, which examined serum PFAS concentration in relation to serum concentration of antibody to a specific antigen following a vaccine. Study appraisal and synthesis methods: We used the risk of bias assessment for non-randomized studies of exposure and certainty assessment method proposed by Morgan et al. (2019). Using a multilevel meta-regression model, we quantitatively synthesized the data. Results: The 14 reports represented 13 unique groups of subjects; the frequency of studies of a given antibody was Tetanus (n = 7); followed by Diphtheria (6); Measles (4); Rubella (3); Haemophilus influenzae type b and Influenza A H1N1 (2 each); and Hepatitis A, Hepatitis B, Influenza A H2N3, Influenza B, and Mumps (1 each). There were approximately 4,830 unique participants included in the analyses across the 14 reports. The models of coefficients between antibody concentration and the five principal PFAS showed homogeneity of associations across antibody types for each principal PFAS. In the models with all antibodies treated as one type, evidence of effect modification by life stage was present for PFOA and PFOS, and for consistency, all associations were evaluated for all ages and for children. The summary associations (coefficients for difference in log(e){[}antibody concentration] per doubling of serum PFAS) with 95\% confidence intervals that excluded zero ({''}statistical support{''}), and certainty of evidence ratings were as follows: for PFOA and all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.10, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.16, -0.03; moderate); for Diphtheria in children, -0.12 (-0.23, -0.00; high); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.17, -0.01; moderate), and for Tetanus in children, -0.12 (-0.24, -0.00; moderate). For PFOS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.06 (-0.11, -0.01; moderate) and in children, -0.10 (-0.18, -0.03; moderate); for Rubella in all ages, -0.09 (-0.15, -0.03; high) and in children, -0.12 (-0.20, -0.04; high). For PFHxS the summary associations were, for all antibodies treated as one type in all ages, -0.03 (-0.06, -0.00; moderate) and in children, -0.05 (-0.09, -0.00; low); and for Rubella in children, -0.07 (-0.11, -0.02; high). Summary associations for PFNA and PFDA did not have statistical support, but all PFAS studied tended to have an inverse association with antibody concentrations. Limitations and conclusions: Epidemiologic data on immunosuppression and five principal PFAS suggest an association, with support across antibodies against multiple types of antigens. Data on Diphtheria, Rubella, and Tetanus were more supportive of an association than for other antibodies, and support was greater for associations with PFOA, PFOS, and PFHxS, than for PFNA or PFDA. The data on any specific antibody were scarce. Confounding factors that might account for the relation were not identified.

Results: Twenty-five relevant studies involving 30079 participants were finally selected from four databases. The combined estimates indicate that prenatal exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS), and perfluoroenanthic acid (PFHpA) is associated with gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) (PFOA: OR = 1.45, 95\%CI: 1.07-1.94, P = 0.015; PFHxS: OR = 1.16, 95\%CI: 1.00-1.36, P = 0.055; PFBS: OR = 1.44, 95\%CI: 1.16-1.79, P = 0.001; PFHpA: OR = 1.41, 95\%CI: 1.10-1.82, P = 0.008).

Pathway enrichment analysis was performed using Mummichog and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis. Significance across cohorts was determined using weighted Z-tests.RESULTS: In the SOLAR and CHS cohorts, PFAS exposure was associated with alterations in tyrosine metabolism (meta-analysis p = 0.00002) and de novo fatty acid biosynthesis (p = 0.03), among others. For example, when increasing all PFAS in the mixture from low ( 30th percentile) to high ( 70th percentile), thyroxine (T4), a thyroid hormone related to tyrosine metabolism, increased by 0.72 standard deviations (SDs; equivalent to a standardized mean difference) in the SOLAR cohort (95\% Bayesian credible interval (BCI): 0.00, 1.20) and 1.60 SD in the CHS cohort (95\% BCI: 0.39, 2.80). Similarly, when going from low to high PFAS exposure, arachidonic acid increased by 0.81 SD in the SOLAR cohort (95\% BCI: 0.37, 1.30) and 0.67 SD in the CHS cohort (95\% BCI: 0.00, 1.50). In general, no individual PFAS appeared to drive the observed associations. DISCUSSION: Exposure to PFAS is associated with alterations in amino acid metabolism and lipid metabolism in adolescents and young adults. https:// doi.org/10.1289/EHP11372",,10.1289/EHP11372,Cohort Studies;Adolescent,NA,,metabolic signatures of youth exposure to mixtures of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances a multicohort study

Methods We conducted two systematic reviews of age at menarche and PFOA, PFOS, PCBs and DDE/DDT based on publications indexed by pubmed. Results 16 unique reports were identified. Most studies of PFOA and PFOS reported either no association or delays in the age at menarche; only one reported an earlier age. Studies of DDT and DDE were more mixed. Reports on PCBs varied by PCB congener group with an equal number of them reporting delays and no association but one an acceleration. Sources of variation in results include the timing of exposure assessment (prenatal vs. postnatal), level of the toxicant, and sample size. No obvious pattern to the variation in results could be tied to those sources of variation. Conclusion The absence of consistent evidence from multiple reports of earlier age at menarche suggests that these toxicants may not be responsible for accelerated sexual maturation in girls. However, human populations naturally vary in the variety and levels of exposure, making the comparison of studies difficult.

This systematic review aims to assess PFAS associations with low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), total cholesterol (TC) and total triglyceride (TG) concentrations in human populations.Method: We systematically searched four online databases, PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for rele-vant peer-reviewed English language articles published until July 2021. Additional relevant articles identified were also included in the search results. We categorised populations into adults (>= 18 years old) and children. Primary find-ings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and LDL, HDL, TC, and TG concentrations in the serum, plasma, or whole blood; secondary findings were the associations between PFAS concentrations and the odds of lipid-related health outcomes. Quantitative synthesis was done by vote counting of the effect directions between con-centrations of PFAS and lipids/health outcomes, repeated on articles with sample size >1000. Sign tests were per-formed to assess the statistical significance of the differences between positive and negative associations. Sensitivity analysis was performed by separating out articles with populations having high concentrations of perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). Quality was assessed with the STROBE checklist and NHBLI Study Quality Assessment Tool.Results: A total of 58 articles were included for review. There was evidence that PFAS exposure is associated with higher concentrations of LDL, HDL, and TC, particularly for PFOA-LDL, PFOA-TC, PFOS-TC, and PFNA-LDL. Associa-tions between PFAS and TG tended to be negative, especially for perfluoroundecanoic acid (PFUnDA). Associations between PFAS concentration and the odds of secondary outcomes generally supported a positive association between PFAS and cholesterol concentrations.Conclusion: We found evidence of associations between the concentrations of some PFAS-lipid pairs in human popula-tions.

Therefore, in this systematic review and meta-analysis, we evaluated the effects of PFAS on female fertility based on population evidence.Methods: Electronic searches of the Web of Science, PubMed, The Cochrane Library, and Embase databases were conducted (from inception to March 2022) to collect observational studies related to PFAS and female fertility. Two evaluators independently screened the literature, extracted information and evaluated the risk of bias for the included studies, meta-analysis was performed using R software.Results: A total of 5468 records were searched and 13 articles fully met the inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis showed that perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was negatively associated with the female fecundability odds ratio (FOR = 0.88, 95\% confidence interval (Cl) {[}0.78; 0.98]) and positively associated with the odds ratio for infertility (OR = 1.33, 95\%Cl {[}1.03; 1.73]).

Intoxication caused by organochlorines can cause serious health compromises that can lead to death. However, the organochlorines molecular mechanism remains unclear. Therefore, researching about this topic is necessary to propose new therapeutic strategies. This study presents a bioinformatics approach to elucidate the metabolic pathways involved in organochlorines exposure using strategies based in support vector machines with recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) followed by an enrichment pathway analysis with null-diffusion. Methods: five groups of HepG2 cells were exposed to aldrin, DDT, endosulfan, lindane, and a mixture of them. A control group with dimethyl sulfoxide was included. A metabolomic analysis was done using GC/MS-TOF, followed by SVM-RFE and a pathway analysis using FELLA in order to identify relevant metabolites and metabolic pathways affected. Genes reported by FELLA were introduced in gene ontology platform (GO) to estimate cellular components where reactions associated to organochlorines occur. Results: 153 metabolites were identified in metabolomic analysis. SVM-RFE was trained with the datasets and the top ten metabolites for each organochlorine were determined. Pentose phosphate and the central carbon metabolism in cancer were identified by FELLA as common pathways for all organochlorines.

Following regulatory bans on the production and emission of PFOA, concerns have been raised about the potential health risks and the safety of novel perfluoroalkyl analogues. HFPO-DA (trade name Gen-X) and HFPO-TA are two perfluoroalkyl analogues known to be bioaccumulative, whose level of toxicity and whether they are safe alternatives to PFOA remain unclear. In the following study, the physiological and metabolic effects of exposure to PFOA and its novel analogues were explored in zebrafish using 1/3 LC50 (PFOA 100 mu M, Gen-X 200 mu M, HFPO-TA 30 mu M). At the same LC50 toxicological effect, exposure to PFOA and HFPO-TA resulted in abnormal phenotypes such as spinal curvature, pericardial edema and aberrant body length, while Gen-X was little changed. Metabolically, PFOA, HFPO-TA and Gen-X all significantly increased total cholesterol in exposed zebrafish with PFOA and HFPO-TA also increasing total triglyceride levels. Transcriptome analysis showed that the number of differentially expressed genes in PFOA, Gen-X, and HFPO-TA treated conditions compared to control groups were 527, 572, and 3, 933, respectively. KEGG and GO analysis of differentially expressed genes revealed pathways and functions related to lipid metabolism as well as significant activation of the peroxisome proliferators-activated receptor (PPARs) pathway. Furthermore, RT-qPCR analysis identified significant dysregulation in the downstream target genes of PPAR alpha, which is responsible for lipid oxidative catabolism, and the SREBP pathway, which is responsible for lipid synthesis.

To provide a comprehensive synopsis and show the gaps and gluts of existing research on PFAS exposure in wildlife, we created a systematic map and bibliographic analysis of the literature. We followed our protocol to conduct a systematic literature search on Scopus, Web of Science and five other databases. In two steps (title/abstract/keywords and full-text), we screened peer-reviewed empirical articles, preprints and theses in English that studied the concentration of at least one of 34 PFAS compounds in free-ranging wildlife or their parts/products. Following the protocol, we extracted data and performed a critical appraisal. We included 581 publications. From the first and only paper in 2001, there was a linear annual increase to 54 papers in 2021. While PFOS (97\% of studies), PFOA (91\%) and long-chain PFAS in general were the most measured, few studies investigated new-generation PFAS (e.g. GenX and ADONA). Across the studied 1042 species from 26 taxonomic classes, the most frequent were the common carp (Cyprinus carpio, 8\%), polar bear (Ursus maritimus, 6\%) and European perch (Perca fluviatilis, 5\%).

Polar regions attracted significant research interest from countries all around the globe. Aquatic habitats (marine: 31\%, freshwater: 28\%) of temperate zones were the most common locations for sample collection. We encourage researchers to work towards closing the following gaps: investigating new-generation PFAS, assessing PFAS in mid- and low-income countries and performing more long-term studies, especially on invertebrates. We note the recent rise in studies on the physiological consequences of PFAS exposure and encourage further work on this crucial topic.

We excluded studies on temporal trends or providing estimates of half-life based solely on renal clearance. As persistent and ongoing exposures can influence half-life estimation, we decided to include only studies that were conducted after the main source of exposure to PFAS had ceased. A random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on studies that reported perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) or perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) half-life estimation. Risk of bias was evaluated using the OHAT tool. Results: A total of 13 articles were included in the review, with 5 studies conducted in exposed general populations and 8 studies conducted in exposed workers; the estimated mean half-life ranged from 1.48 to 5.1 years for PFOA, from 3.4 to 5.7 years for total PFOS, and from 2.84 to 8.5 years for PFHxS. High heterogeneity among studies was observed; potential reasons include the variability among the investigated populations, discrepancies in considering ongoing exposures, variability in PFAS isomeric compositions, accounting for background exposure, time since exposure stopped and methods used for half-life estimation. Discussion: Despite the efforts made to better understand PFAS toxicokinetics, further studies are needed to identify important characteristics of these persistent chemicals. Biomonitoring studies should focus on persistent and unaccounted sources of exposure to PFAS and on individual characteristics potentially determining half-life, to ensure accurate estimates.",,10.1016/j.envres.2023.117743,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,NA,,estimation of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas halflives in human studies a systematic review and metaanalysis

Multiple PFAS are associated with adverse liver outcomes in adult humans and toxicological models, but effects on the developing liver are not fully described. Here we performed transcriptomic analyses in the mouse to investigate the molecular mechanisms of hepatic toxicity in the dam and its fetus after exposure to two different PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and its replacement, hexafluoropropylene oxide-dimer acid (HFPO-DA, known as GenX). Pregnant CD-1 mice were exposed via oral gavage from embryonic day (E) 1.5-17.5 to PFOA (0, 1, or 5 mg/kg-d) or GenX (0, 2, or 10 mg/kg-d). Maternal and fetal liver RNA was isolated (N = 5 per dose/group) and the transcriptome analyzed by Affymetrix Array. Differentially expressed genes (DEG) and differentially enriched pathways (DEP) were obtained. DEG patterns were similar in maternal liver for 5 mg/kg PFOA, 2 mg/kg GenX, and 10 mg/kg GenX (R2: 0.46-0.66). DEG patterns were similar across all 4 dose groups in fetal liver (R2: 0.59-0.81). There were more DEGs in fetal liver compared to maternal liver at the low doses for both PFOA (fetal = 69, maternal = 8) and GenX (fetal = 154, maternal = 93). Upregulated DEPs identified across all groups included Fatty Acid Metabolism, Peroxisome, Oxidative Phosphorylation, Adipogenesis, and Bile Acid Metabolism. Transcriptome-phenotype correlation analyses demonstrated > 1000 maternal liver DEGs were significantly correlated with maternal relative liver weight (R2 >0.92). These findings show shared biological pathways of liver toxicity for PFOA and GenX in maternal and fetal livers in CD-1 mice. The limited overlap in specific DEGs between the dam and fetus suggests the developing liver responds differently than the adult liver to these chemical stressors.

Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) standards were followed during the meta-analysis. PubMed, Wed of Science, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Ovid databases were used to identify suitable articles before June 2023. The 95\% CI and 0 values were calculated to assess the association between male sex hormone levels and PFAS exposure. Heterogeneity among the included studies was tested using inconsistency statistics (I2). Results: The literature search identified 12 published articles that met our search criteria, involving 7506 participants. Our results revealed that perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposures were negatively correlated with testosterone (0 = -0.05; 95\% CI: -0.09, -0.02, P = 0.003) and (0 = -0.04; 95\% CI: -0.08, 0.00, P = 0.049), respectively.

Environmental chemicals are one of the drivers of such disturbances. The aim of our study was to examine the effects of exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)-specifically, perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and 2,3,3,3-tetrafluoro-2-(heptafluoropropoxy) propanoic acid (GenX)-on the microbiome of the small intestine and colon, as well as on liver metabolism. Male CD-1 mice were exposed to PFOS and GenX in different concentrations and compared to controls. GenX and PFOS were found to have different effects on the bacterial community in both the small intestine and colon based on 16S rRNA profiles. High GenX doses predominantly led to increases in the abundance of Clostridium sensu stricto, Alistipes, and Ruminococcus, while PFOS generally altered Lactobacillus, Limosilactobacillus, Parabacteroides, Staphylococcus, and Ligilactobacillus. These treatments were associated with alterations in several important microbial metabolic pathways in both the small intestine and colon. Untargeted LC-MS/MS metabolomic analysis of the liver, small intestine, and colon yielded a set of compounds significantly altered by PFOS and GenX. In the liver, these metabolites were associated with the important host metabolic pathways implicated in the synthesis of lipids, steroidogenesis, and in the metabolism of amino acids, nitrogen, and bile acids.

In this review, recent advances in the abatement of PFAS from water using photo-oxidation and photo -reduction are systematically reviewed. Degradation mechanisms of PFAS by photo-oxidation involving the holes (h(vb)(+)) and oxidative radicals and photo-reduction using the electrons (e(cb)(-)) and hydrated electrons (e(aq)(-)) are inte-grated. The recent development of innovative heterogeneous photocatalysts and photolysis systems for enhanced degradation of PFAS is highlighted. Photodegradation mechanisms of alternative compounds, such as hexafluoropropylene oxide dimer acid (GenX) and chlorinated polyfluorinated ether sulfonate (F-53B), are also critically evaluated.

Suresh",,,,,"Lindane or gamma- hexachlorocyclohexane (\& gamma;-HCH) isomer has been one of the most extensively used pesticides worldwide. However, four additional Hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) isomers were produced during its manufacture, resulting in persistence in the environment due to their dissolvability and noxiousness. This study examines the sequential anaerobic-aerobic degradation of synthetically prepared solution of technical HCH (tHCH) utilizing a hybrid reactor system with a UASB reactor coupled to the aerobic system. The ideal conditions for t-HCH degradation were initial substrate concentration (100 mg L- 1), glucose as suitable electron donor, active biomass (12 g L-1), pH (neutral range), HRT (48 h) and organic loading rate (4.28 mg/g/day). Individual reactor findings demonstrated that the UASB reactor performed efficiently with these parameters, showing 90.03\% degradation of 100 mg L-1 t-HCH in two days after a month of operation. In aerobic degradation, the selected isolate can break down 87\% of 100 mg L-1 of t-HCH in eight days. Subsequent to individual reactor operations, the reactors were synchronized in the hybrid reactor and after 60 days of continuous operation, tHCH was dechlorinated completely in the presence of glucose as a co-substrate. Therefore, compared to individual anaerobic and aerobic treatments, this sequential degradation showed an improvement in HCH removal efficiency of > 99\%. This is the first study that demonstrates the mineralization of HCH intermediates in a hybrid reactor system.

Objectives: To investigate associations between PFAS exposure and incident CVD (a combined CVD end-point consisting of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or heart failure) in two independent population-based cohorts in Sweden. In addition, we performed a meta-analysis also including results from previous studies. Methods: In 2,278 subjects aged 45-75 years from the EpiHealth study, the risk of incident CVD in relation to relative plasma levels of perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) was investigated. Associations between plasma levels of six PFAS and incident CVD were also examined in the PIVUS-study (n = 1,016, all aged 70 years). In addition, a meta-analysis was performed including three previous prospective studies, together with the results from the present study. Results: There were no overall statistically significant associations between levels of the different PFAS and incident CVD, neither in EpiHealth nor in PIVUS. However, there was a significant sex interaction for PFOS in EpiHealth (p = 0.008), and an inverse association could be seen only in men (Men, HR: 0.68, 95 \% CI: 0.52, 0.89) (Women, HR: 1.13, 95 \% CI: 0.82, 1.55). A meta-analysis of five independent studies regarding PFOA and incident CVD showed a risk ratio (RR) of 0.80 (CI: 0.66, 0.94) when high levels were compared to low levels. Conclusions: This longitudinal study using data from two population-based cohort studies in Sweden did not indicate any increased risk of incident CVD for moderately elevated PFAS levels.

The substances have been associated with adverse health outcomes in both pregnant mothers and infants, including pre-eclampsia and low birthweight. A growing body of research suggests that PFAS are transferred from mother to fetus through the placenta, leading to in utero exposure. A systematic review was performed using the PubMed database to search for studies evaluating determinants of PFAS concentrations in blood matrices of pregnant mothers and neonates shortly after birth. Studies were included in this review if an observational study design was utilized, exposure to at least one PFAS analyte was measured, PFAS were measured in maternal or neonatal matrices, at least one determinant of PFAS concentrations was assessed, and results such as beta estimates were provided. We identified 35 studies for inclusion in the review and evaluated the PFAS and determinant relationships among the factors collected in these studies. Parity, breastfeeding history, maternal race and country of origin, and household income had the strongest and most consistent evidence to support their roles as determinants of certain PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers. Reported study findings on smoking status, alcohol consumption, and pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) suggest that these factors are not important determinants of PFAS concentrations in pregnant mothers or neonates. Further study into informative factors such as consumer product use, detailed dietary information, and consumed water sources as potential determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is needed. Research on determinants of maternal or neonatal PFAS concentrations is critical to estimate past PFAS exposure, build improved exposure models, and further our understanding on dose-response relationships, which can influence epidemiological studies and risk assessment evaluations.

Parameters of interest included the following: sampling dates and locations, numbers of collection sites and participants, detection frequencies, and occurrence statistics. Detailed data were extracted on PFAS occurrence in indoor and environmental media from 229 references and on PFAS occurrence in human matrices where available from those references. Studies of PFAS occurrence became numerous after 2005. Studies were most abundant for PFOA (80\% of the references) and PFOS (77\%). Many studies analyzed additional PFAS, particularly, PFNA and PFHxS (60\% of references each). Food (38\%) and drinking water (23\%) were the commonly studied media. Most studies found detectable levels of PFAS, and detectable levels were reported in a majority of states in the United States. Half or more of the limited studies for indoor air and products detected PFAS in 50\% or more of the collected samples. The resulting databases can inform problem formulation for systematic reviews to address specific PFAS exposure queries and questions, support prioritization of PFAS sampling, and inform PFAS exposure measurement studies. The search strategy should be extended and implemented to support living evidence review in this rapidly advancing area.",,10.1021/acs.est.2c07185,,NA,,systematic evidence mapping of potential exposure pathways for per and polyfluoroalkyl substances based on measured occurrence in multiple media

Because of their high detection frequency, persistence, and potential toxicity, interest in both PFOA and PFOS has increased in recent years. However, a substantial number of PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests only report nominal, or unmeasured, treatment concentrations, which may complicate the determination of protective values. In addition, previous literature has indicated that differences between nominal and measured concentrations of both PFOA and PFOS could be linked to experimental conditions (e.g., feeding regimes for test organisms, test vessel material {[}glass or plastic], use of solvent, and the presence of substrate). Therefore, this critical review examined whether nominal and measured concentrations were in close agreement with each other among the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature and if experimental conditions were associated with any observed differences. Nominal and measured concentrations in the current PFOA and PFOS aquatic toxicity literature generally displayed a high degree of linear correlation and relatively low median percent differences. Correlations between measured and nominal concentrations were >0.98 for PFOA and >0.95 for PFOS in freshwater tests across experimental conditions. For saltwater tests, correlations of >0.84 were observed for PFOA and PFOS (separate and combined) across experimental conditions. While measured PFOA and PFOS toxicity tests are generally preferred, the present meta-analysis demonstrated that experimental conditions had little influence on observed discrepancies between nominal and measured concentrations, with the exception of PFOS saltwater tests and PFOA and PFOS freshwater studies that contained substrate. Unmeasured tests with these conditions should be considered carefully based on project needs, with the caveat that the data sets for these two experimental conditions were limited.

We examined the associations between maternal PFAS exposure and maternal glucose metabolisms and GDM risk among 1601 mothers who joined the Hyperglycaemia-and-Adverse-Pregnancy-Outcome (HAPO) Study in Hong Kong in 2001-2006. All mothers underwent a 75 g-oral-glucose-tolerance test at 24-32 weeks of gestation. We measured serum concentrations of six PFAS biomarkers using high-performance liquid-chromatography-coupled-withtandem-mass-spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). We fitted conventional and advanced models (quantile-g-computation {[}qgcomp] and Bayesian-kernel machine regression {[}BKMR]) to assess the associations of individual and a mixture of PFAS with glycaemic traits. Subgroup analyses were performed based on the enrollment period by the severe - acute -respiratory -syndrome (SARS) epidemic periods in Hong Kong between March 2003 and May 2004. PFOS and PFOA were the main components of PFAS mixture among 1601 pregnant women in the Hong Kong HAPO study, with significantly higher median PFOS concentrations (19.09 ng/mL), compared to Chinese pregnant women (9.40 ng/mL) and US women (5.27 ng/mL).

The objective of this study was to know the effects of PFASs on microbial communities and their functional genes from source water to tap water. PFASs were detected by mass-labeled internal standards method, and the microbial communities and functional genes were analyzed by meta-genomics. Our results indicated that the concentration of total PFASs in the water ranged from 47.7 to 171.4 ng/ L, with perfluorobutanoic acid (PFBA) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) being the dominant types. The PFASs concentration decreased slowly from source to tap water in some months. PFBA, PFOA, perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA) influenced the functional genes related to two-component system, bacterial secretion system and flagellar assembly of Aquabacterium, Methylobacterium, and Curvibacter, which contributed significantly to macB and evgS. Therefore, the bacterial communities enhanced adaptation to fluctuating environments by upregulating some functional genes under the PFASs stress, with concomitant changes in the expression of ARGs. Moreover, PFASs also promoted the expression of functional genes associated with human diseases, such as shigellosis and tuberculosis, which increased the risk of human pathogenicity. The bench scale experiment results also suggested that PFOA and PFOS in drinking water can promote the ARGs proliferation and induce microbial risk. Therefore, it is necessary to take measures to prevent the risks caused by PFASs and ARGs in drinking water.",,10.1016/j.watres.2023.120831,,NA,,the perfluoroalkyl substances influenced the distribution of bacterial communities and their functions from source water to tap water

A large number of studies using different approaches provide evidence regarding effects of environmental exposures, encompassed in the exposome, on children's health. We aimed to summarize the overall level of evidence (LoE) from all streams of evidence regarding exposome effects on child health. For 88 selected chemical and urban factors, we retrieved the conclusions of agency reports or literature reviews published between 2015 and 2021 regarding effects on child health, including cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodevelopmental, respiratory and other health outcomes. Adapted versions of PRISMA flowchart and AMSTAR-2 tool were used to select and assess the quality of the systematic reviews retrieved from PubMed and SCOPUS databases. For each factor-outcome pair, conclusions in three streams of evidence (epidemiological, toxicological and mechanistic, the latter corresponding to in vitro and in silico approaches) were translated into stream-specific LoEs and then combined into an overall LoE ranging from ``very unlikely{''} to ``very likely{''}. The 88 environmental factors were implied in 611 factor-outcome pairs. Forty-four pairs (7\%), corresponding to 16 factors, had a very likely overall LoE (>= 80\%); 127 pairs (21\%), corresponding to 49 factors, had a likely or more overall LoE (>= 60\%). For 81 pairs (13\%), no evidence was available in agency reports or published reviews, while for 275 pairs (45\%), corresponding to 68 factors, the overall LoE was very unlikely (<20\%).

A growing number of evidence shows that skin exposure is an important intake pathway for human to absorb emerging pollutants. The skin permeability of pollutants is mainly reflected by the skin permeability coefficient and permeation flux. In vivo or in vitro experiments with human and animal models are the main means to determine the transdermal characteristics of emerging pollutants. However, these methods have many disadvantages such as high cost, time-consuming, large differences, and ethics. It is difficult to accurately estimate the skin exposure risk of emerging pollutants. Therefore, it is necessary to build up a skin permeability prediction mathematical model to assess the exposure and health risks of emerging pollutants. This article systematically reviews the research progress on the application of the skin permeability prediction model in the health risk assessment of emerging pollutants. At first, the basic structure of the skin and the main transdermal absorption pathways of emerging pollutants are introduced. Secondly, the basic principles and applications of existing skin permeability prediction models are summarized. The QSAR model and PBTK model were described according to the ratio of penetration to exposure dose. The QSAR model is described in detail to establish a regular model to predict the permeability of chemical pollutants in the skin by linking the structure and physicochemical characteristics of chemical substances with skin permeability. The accuracy of the results depends on the reliability of the modeling data. The PBTK model can be divided into the single-compartment model and the two-compartment model according to the characteristics of skin structure. And we summarized the application of the PBTK model on exposure risk assessment for industry workers or consumers. Moreover, we clarified the application of permeability prediction models in exposure risk and human health risk assessment and prospected the future research direction on dermal exposure risk assessment of emerging pollutants. The skin permeability prediction model optimizes the exposure parameters of daily skin exposure in risk assessment by predicting the skin permeability coefficient or permeability of emerging pollutants, to accurately assess the human exposure and health risk of emerging pollutants. At the end of this research progress, the future research objectives of skin permeability prediction models are pointed out: Improving the accuracy of data and considering the effect of skin esterase on skin permeability in prediction models.",,10.1360/TB-2022-1115,Risk Assessment;Permeability,NA,,research progress on the application of skin permeability prediction model in health risk assessment of emerging pollutants

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), a group of widely used industrial chemicals, are characterized by persistence, long-distance migration, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. Some PFAS, particularly perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS), have been banned, leaving only legacy exposure to the environment and human body, while a number of novel PFAS alternatives have emerged and raised concerns, such as polyfluoroalkyl ether sulfonic and carboxylic acid (PFESA and PFECA) and sodium p-perfluorous nonenoxybenzene sulfonate (OBS). Overall, this review systematically elucidated the adverse cardiovascular (CV) effects of legacy and emerging PFAS, emphasized the dose/concentration-dependent, time-dependent, carbon chain length-dependent, sex-specific, and coexposure effects, and discussed the underlying mechanisms and possible prevention and treatment. Extensive epidemiological and laboratory evidence suggests that accumulated serum levels of legacy PFAS possibly contribute to an increased risk of CVD and its subclinical course, such as cardiac toxicity, vascular disorder, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. The underlying biological mechanisms may include oxidative stress, signaling pathway disturbance, lipid metabolism disturbance, and so on. Various emerging alternatives to PFAS also play increasingly prominent toxic roles in CV outcomes that are milder, similar to, or more severe than legacy PFAS.

We found that maternal PFASs exposure was positively correlated with PTB (OR:1.13, 95\% CI:1.04-1.23), SGA (OR:1.10, 95\% CI:1.04-1.16) and miscarriage (OR:1.09, 95\% CI:1.00-1.19). The pooled estimates also showed maternal PAEs exposure was linked with PTB (OR:1.16, 95\% CI:1.11-1.21), SGA (OR:1.20, 95\% CI:1.07-1.35) and miscarriage (OR:1.55, 95\% CI:1.33-1.81). In addition, maternal exposure to some specific class of EDCs including PFOS, MBP, MEHP, DEHP, and BPA was associated with PTB. Maternal exposure to PFOS, PFOA, PFHpA was associated with SGA. Maternal exposure to BPA was associated with LBW. Maternal exposure to MMP, MEHP, MEHHP, MEOHP, BPA was associated with miscarriage. Maternal PFASs, PAEs and BPA exposure may increase adverse pregnancy outcomes risk according to our study.

Using estimates of the specific gestational week of sampling, the meta-regression showed results consistent with the categorical sample analysis, in that as gesta-tional age at sampling time increases across these studies, the summary effect estimate of a mean BWT deficit got larger. Overall, we detected mean BWT deficits for PFNA that were larger and more consistent across studies than previous PFAS meta-analyses. Compared to studies with later sampling, BWT deficits were smaller but remained sizeable for even the earliest sampling periods.

It has currently been identified in the environment and human bodies; nonetheless, the possible toxicities are not well-known. Zebrafish have been used as a toxicant screening model due to their fast and transparent developmental pro-cesses. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to PFHxS for five days, and various experiments were performed to monitor the developmental and cellular processes. Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC/ MS) analysis confirmed that PFHxS was absorbed and accumulated in the zebrafish embryos. We reported that 2.5 mu M or higher PFHxS exposure induced phenotypic abnormalities, marked by developmental delay in the mid -hind brain boundary and yolk sac edema. Additionally, larvae exposed to PFHxS displayed facial malformation due to the reduction of neural crest cell expression. RNA sequencing analysis further identified 4643 differen-tiated expressed transcripts in 5 mu M PFHxS-exposed 5-days post fertilization (5-dpf) larvae. Bioinformatics analysis revealed that glucose metabolism, lipid metabolism, as well as oxidative stress were enriched in the PFHxS-exposed larvae. To validate these findings, a series of biological experiments were conducted. PFHxS exposure led to a nearly 4-fold increase in reactive oxygen species, possibly due to hyperglycemia and impaired glutathione balance. The Oil Red O' staining and qPCR analysis strengthens the notions that lipid metabolism was disrupted, leading to lipid accumulation, lipid peroxidation, and malondialdehyde formation. All these al-terations ultimately affected cell cycle events, resulting in S and G2/M cell cycle arrest.

However, PFBS toxicity in the mammalian gut remains unclear. C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 10 mu g/L and 500 mu g/L PFBS or 500 mu g/L PFOS in their water supply for 28 days. PFBS toxicity in the ileum and colon was explored and com-pared to that of PFOS. Biochemical analysis showed that tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) and interleukin-1f3 (IL-1f3) levels increased in the ileum exposed to 10 mu g/L PFBS, whereas no significant changes were observed in those levels in the colon. Catalase (CAT) activity, malondialdehyde (MDA), TNF-a, and IL-1f3 levels increased and glutathione (GSH) levels decreased in the ileum of the 500 mu g/L-PFBS group, whereas only MDA levels increased in the colon of the 500 mu g/L-PFBS group. The results showed that more severe damage occurred in the ileum than in the colon after PFBS exposure, and these align with the 500 mu g/L-PFOS group exposure as well. Furthermore, metabolomic anal-ysis revealed glutathione metabolism as a vital factor in inducing PFBS and PFOS toxicities in the ileum. Steroid hor-mone and amino acid metabolisms were other important factors involved in PFBS and PFOS toxicities, respectively. In the colon, GSH, pyrimidine, and glucose (especially galactose) metabolism was the main contributor to PFBS toxicity, and sulfur amino acid metabolism was the main pathway for PFOS toxicity.

The review included 37 total articles, including 9 animal studies and 1 human study measuring the direct contribution of exposure of the infant or pup through milk for any health outcome. Animal studies provided evidence of associations between exposure to PFOA through breastfeeding and reduced early life body weight gain, mammary gland development, and thyroid hormone levels. They also provided limited evidence of associations between PFOS exposure through breastfeeding with reduced early life body weight gain and cellular changes in the hippocampus. The direct relevance of any of these outcomes to human health is uncertain, and it is possible that many adverse health effects of exposure through breastfeeding have not yet been studied.

Howbeit, the current literature lacks a comprehensive and comparative overview of the various degradation pathways and mechanisms. This systematic review compiles and analyzes the mechanisms and degradation pathways of PFAS by persulfate activation, photocatalysis, UV/sulfite, electron beam, electrochemical oxidation, plasma, ozonation, and sonochemical oxidation. We found that the degradation pathways of perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs) and Perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSAs) were investigated more than any other PFAS. This review implies that the defluorination and degradation pathways of PFAS are reliant on the type of dominant reactive oxidant or reductive species. For instance, holes usually oxidize PFAS to unstable perfluoroalkyl radicals accompanied by losing head groups, whereas hydroxyl and superoxide radicals cleave C-C and C-F bonds. On the other hand, hydrated electrons directly eliminate the head group followed by releasing CF2 units. Furthermore, the imposed crystal facets and functional groups of the introduced catalytic surfaces in the case of heterogeneous catalysis (e.g., photocatalysts) affected the degradation pathways and defluorination rates by anchoring PFAS molecules from the head groups (e.g., carboxylate and sulfonate group). This study lays the groundwork for future research to analyze and elucidate the transformation products and pathways of PFAS in various treatment systems.",,10.1016/j.cej.2022.138352,Oxidation-Reduction,NA,,mechanisms and pathways of pfas degradation by advanced oxidation and reduction processes a critical review

Accumulated evidence implies that GenX exposure might exert adverse health effects, although the underlying mechanisms have not been fully revealed. In this study, pregnant BALB/c mice were exposed to GenX (2 mg/kg/day), PFOA (1 mg/kg/day), or Milli-Q water by gavage from the first day of gestation (GD0) until GD21. Necropsy and tissue collection were conducted in pups at 4 weeks of age. PFOA and GenX induced similar histopathological changes in both the liver and the intestinal mucosa, accompanied by higher serum levels of alanine and aspartate aminotransferase. Moreover, the capacity of hepatic glycogen storage and intestinal mucus secretion were significantly decreased, suggesting dysfunction of liver metabolism and the intestinal mucosal barrier. A total of 637 and 352 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in the liver tissues of GenX and PFOA group, respectively. Most of the enriched pathways from the DEGs by KEGG enrichment analysis were metabolism-associated. Moreover, overexpression of CYP4A14, Sult2a1, Cpt1b, Acaa1b, Igfbp1, Irs-2 and decreased expression of Gys2 wereobserved in livers of GenX exposed pups, supporting the hypothesis that there was metabolic disruption. Furthermore, DNA damage and cell cycle arrest proteins (Gadd45 beta, p21, Ppard) were significantly increased, while cell proliferation-related proteins (Cyclin E, Myc, EGFR) were decreased by gestational GenX exposure in the pups' liver. In addition, imbalance of gut microbiota and dysfunction of the intestinal mucosa barrier might contribute to hepatotoxicity at least in part. Taken together, our results suggested that gestational GenX exposure triggered metabolic disorder, which might be responsible for the hepatotoxicity in the pups in addition to dysfunction of the intestinal mucosa barrier.

Municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) provide important conduits between waste sources and the environment. We present a meta-analysis of results reported in 44 peer-reviewed publications that include 460 influent and 528 effluent samples, collected from 21 countries, for which some or all of five per-fluorinated carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and three perfluorinated sulfonic acids (PFSAs) were measured. Our meta analysis revealed global patterns and trends that, to our knowledge, have not been reported elsewhere. Regression analyses of samples collected from 2004 to 2020 quantified the temporal trends of global wastewater effluent concentrations of each of the PFAS and the corresponding mean concentration for each country. Although legacy compounds, perfluoroctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), have been reported with the highest measured concentrations, their global temporal trends are lowest of all PFAS considered. Concentrations of most PFAS analyzed in wastewater in the United States have not changed significantly with time, whereas reported PFAS concentrations in wastewater effluent from China have increased from 11\% to 37\% per year. In addition, our results show significant positive correlations between previous wastewater effluent concentrations of individual PFAS and the gross domestic product per capita of each country. Our analysis of this global data set also confirmed conclusions from previous studies on smaller data sets: (i) none of the PFAS studied are effectively removed by conventional treatment processes; (ii) effluents from treatment plants that include a significant industrial component to their influent tend to have higher PFAS concentrations; and (iii) the few studies that measured both aqueous concentrations and concentrations adsorbed to suspended particulate matter (SPM) indicate that PFAS adsorbed to SPM can contribute significantly to the total PFAS load.",,10.1016/j.watres.2022.118784,,NA,,global patterns and temporal trends of perfluoroalkyl substances in municipal wastewater a metaanalysis

Animal studies suggest that PFAS may increase risk of fatty liver and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) via impacts on hepatic lipid, amino acid, and glucose metabolism, but human data is lacking. We examined associations between PFAS exposure, altered metabolic pathways, and risk of non-viral HCC. Methods: In this nested case-control study, pre-diagnostic plasma PFAS and metabolomics were measured in 50 incident HCC cases and 50 individually matched controls from the Multiethnic Cohort (MEC) study. Cases/controls were matched by age, sex, race, and study area. PFAS exposure and risk of HCC were examined using conditional logistic regression. A metabolome-wide association study and pathway enrichment analysis was performed for PFAS exposure and HCC risk, and key metabolites/metabolic pathways were identified using a meet in the middle approach. Results: High perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) levels (90th percentile from NHANES; > 55 lg/L) were associated with 4.5 -fold increased risk of HCC (odds ratio 4.5, 95\% CI 1.2-16.0). Pathway enrichment analysis showed that PFOS exposure was associated with alterations in amino acid and glycan biosynthesis pathways, which were also associated with HCC risk. We identified 4 metabolites linking PFOS exposure with HCC, including glucose, butyric acid (a short-chain fatty acid), alpha-ketoisovaleric acid (a branched-chain a-keto acid), and 7 alpha-hydroxy-3-oxo-4-cholestenoate (a bile acid), each of which was positively associated with PFOS exposure and risk of HCC. Conclusion: This proof-of-concept analysis shows that exposure to high PFOS levels was associated with increased risk of non-viral HCC, likely via alterations in glucose, amino acid, and bile acid metabolism. Larger studies are needed to confirm these findings. Lay summary: Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), often referred to as ``forever chemicals `` because they are difficult to break down and stay in the human body for years, are extremely common and can cause liver damage. In a first of its kind study, we found that exposure to high levels of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, one of the most common PFAS chemicals, was linked to increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in humans.

Emerging evidence suggested that endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), which have the potential to interfere with the function of normal hormones, may play a crucial role in this trend.

Objective and search methods: In our study, we sought to fully evaluate the currently available epidemiological evidence to ascertain whether certain EDC congeners and their metabolites are related to breast cancer risk. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, we conducted a comprehensive literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in three electronic databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase. Publications that covered xenobiotic EDC exposures and breast cancer-confirmed histological results or antecedent medical records or reporting to health registers were taken into consideration. Outcomes: The final result of the literature search was 6,498 references, out which we found 67 publications that matched the requirements for meta-analysis and eight publications for qualitative trend synthesis. In this meta-analysis, statistically significant associations revealed that (i) 1-chloro-4-{[}2,2,2-trichloro-1-(4-chlorophenyl)ethyl]benzene (p,p'-DDT) and its major metabolite 2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethylene (p,p'-DDE) were somewhat related to a greater risk of breast cancer. However, this relationship only existed in blood serum but not in adipose tissue. (ii) Breast cancer risk was increased by exposure to chlordane and hexachlorocyclohexane. (iii) Five polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB 99, PCB 105, PCB 118, PCB 138, and PCB 183) can increase the risk of breast cancer. (iv) One phthalate congener (BBP) and one per- and polyfluoroalkyl substance congener (PFDoDA) were negatively associated with breast cancer risk.

We conducted study-specific multivariable linear regression analyses estimating the associations of metabolite levels with levels of PFOS or PFOA. For metabolites measured in at least 3 of 8 nested case-control studies, random effects meta-analysis was used to summarize study-specific results (1,038 metabolites in PFOS analyses and 1,100 in PFOA analyses). Results: The meta-analysis identified 51 and 38 metabolites associated with PFOS and PFOA, respectively, at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level (4.8x10-5 and 4.6x10-5, respectively). For both PFOS and PFOA, the most common types of associated metabolites were lipids (sphingolipids, fatty acid metabolites) and xenobiotics (xanthine metabolites, chemicals). Positive associations were commonly observed with lipid metabolites sphingomyelin (d18:1/18:0) (P = 2.0x10-10 and 2.0x10-8, respectively), 3-carboxy-4-methyl-5-pentyl-2-furanpro-pionate (P = 2.7x10-15, 1.1x10-17), and lignoceroylcarnitine (C24) (P = 2.6x10-8, 6.2x10-6).

PFAS substances that have longer carbon chains, such as PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), can potentially pose a significant public health risk due to their ability to bioaccumulate and persist for long periods of time in the body and the environment. The National Academies Report suggests there is some evidence of PFOS exposure and gastrointestinal (GI) inflammation contributing to ulcerative colitis. Inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis are precursors to colorectal cancer. However, evidence about the association between PFOS and colorectal cancer is limited and has shown contradictory findings. This review provides an overview of population and preclinical studies on PFOS exposure and GI inflammation, metabolism, immune responses, and carcinogenesis. It also highlights some mitigation approaches to reduce the harmful effects of PFOS on GI tract and discusses the dietary strategies, such as an increase in soluble fiber intake, to reduce PFOS-induced alterations in cellular lipid metabolism. More importantly, this review demonstrates the urgent need to better understand the relationship between PFOS and GI pathology and carcinogenesis, which will enable development of better approaches for interventions in populations exposed to high levels of PFAS, and in particular to PFOS.",,10.3389/ftox.2023.1244457,Sulfones;Inflammation;Sulfonic Acids,NA,,the role of perfluorooctane sulfonic acid pfos exposure in inflammation of intestinal tissues and intestinal carcinogenesis

Toxicological studies have suggested that exposure to PFASs may lead to several adverse effects, including infertility and cancer development. In light of their widespread use, the contamination of food products has created health concerns in sites directly influenced by industrial and anthropogenic activity. In the present contribution, the current knowledge of PFAS contamination was systematically reviewed in order to provide with the knowledge gaps and main sources of contamination, as well as critically evaluate estimated dietary intake and relative risk values of the consulted studies. Legacy PFASs remain the most abundant despite their production restrictions. Edible species from freshwater bodies exhibit higher PFAS concentrations than marine species, probably due to low hydrodynamics and dilution in lentic ecosystems. Studies in food products from multiple sources, including aquatic, livestock, and agricultural, agree that the proximity to factories and fluorochemical industries rendered significantly higher and potentially hazardous PFAS contamination. Short-chain PFAS are suggested as chemicals of emerging concern to food security. However, the environmental and toxicological implications of short-chain congeners are not fully understood and, thus, much research is needed in this sense.",,10.1007/s13197-022-05545-7,,NA,,per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfass in consumable species and food products

However, PFASs conversion or conjugation to other substances in rice grown on PFASs polluted soil has not been explored clearly. These unknown transformed or conjugated products of PFOA and PFOS could be harmful to human health. The restriction factor in evaluating the possible transformation of PFOA and PFOS is mainly attributed to the lack of an efficient method for screening PFOA and PFOS and their related metabolites. To circumvent this challenge, we established a nontargeted screening method by combining a fluoro-cotton fiber-based solid phase extraction (FC-SPE) and liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) to monitor the formation of possible organic fluorine compounds from rice (Oryza sativa L.) grown on PFASs. We synthesized fluoro-cotton fibers to serve as the FC-SPE packing material and characterized by field-emission scanning electron-microscope, Fourier transform infrared, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurements. The optimal extraction conditions for the prepared FC-SPE were investigated. The performance of FC-SPE in LC-MS analysis was validated by linearity, precision, recovery, and matrix effect. Then the FC-SPE combined with LC-HRMS was used to specifically capture organic fluorine compounds from complex matrices via F-F interaction, including rice seedlings grown in PFOA and PFOS polluted soil and soil samples. By the established FC-SPE LC-HRMS method, in total 429 features were found as the possible organic fluorine compounds from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil among the 1781 features from the rice seedlings. Finally, we employed a13C metabolic tracing analysis of organic fluorine compounds in combination with the FC-SPE LC-HRMS method to further identify the features that detected from rice seedlings grown in PFOA polluted soil.

PFASs occur in edible oil, an important component of the global diet, mainly in three ways: raw material contamination, process contamination, and migration from oil contact materials. Thus, the occurrence of PFAS in edible oils has drawn more and more attention in recent years. In this work, the pertinent literature of the last two decades from the Web of Science database was researched. This review systematically addressed the potential sources, the contamination levels, and the progress of the determination of PFASs in edible oil.

Evidence suggests that exposure to POPs, which is ubiquitous, is associated with microRNA (miRNA) dysregulation. miRNA are key regulators in many physiological processes. It is thus of public health concern to understand the relationships between POPs and miRNA as related to health outcomes. Objectives: This systematic review evaluated the relationship between widely recognized, intentionally manufactured, POPs, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and organochlorine pesticides (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane {[}DDT], dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene {[}DDE], hexachlorobenzene {[}HCB]), with miRNA expression in both human and animal studies. Methods: We used PubMed and Embase to systematically search the literature up to September 29th, 2023. Search results for human and animal studies were included if they incorporated at least one POP of interest in relation to at least one miRNA. Data were synthesized to determine the direction and significance of associations between POPs and miRNA. We utilized ingenuity pathway analysis to review disease pathways for miRNA that were associated with POPs. Results: Our search identified 38 eligible studies: 9 in humans and 29 in model organisms. PFAS were associated with decreased expression of miR-19, miR-193b, and miR-92b, as well as increased expression of miR-128, miR199a-3p, and miR-26b across species.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases, and identified population-based epidemiological studies related to PFAS and glucolipid metabolism indexes that were published before 30 December 2022. The heterogeneity of the included literature was assessed using the I-square (I-2) test and statistics Q. Random-effects and fixed-effects models were used to combine the effect size.

Objectives This study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS with mortality and morbidity of diabetes and to quantitatively evaluate the summary effect estimates of the existing literature. Methods We searched three electronic databases for epidemiological studies concerning PFAS and diabetes published before April 1, 2022. Summary odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio (HR), or beta and their 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were respectively calculated to evaluate the association between PFAS and diabetes using random-effects model by the exposure type, and dose-response meta-analyses were also performed when possible. We also assessed the risk of bias of the studies included and the confidence in the body of evidence. Results An initial literature search identified 1969 studies, of which 22 studies were eventually included. The meta-analyses indicated that the observed statistically significant PFAS-T2DM associations were consistent in cohort studies, while the associations were almost non-significant in case-control and cross-sectional studies. Dose-response meta-analysis showed a ``parabolic-shaped{''} association between perfluorooctanoate acid (PFOA) exposure and T2DM risk. Available evidence was rated with ``low{''} risk of bias, and the level of evidence for PFAS and incident T2DM was considered ``moderate{''}. Conclusions Our findings suggest that PFAS exposure may increase the risk of incident T2DM, and that PFOA may exert non-monotonic dose-response effect on T2DM risk. Considering the widespread exposure, persistence, and potential for adverse health effects of PFAS, further cohort studies with improvements in expanding the sample size, adjusting the covariates, and considering different types of PFAS exposure at various doses, are needed to elucidate the putative causal associations and potential mode of action of different PFAS on diabetes. Impact Statement A growing body of evidence suggests that per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are endocrine disruptors and may contribute to the development of diabetes. However, epidemiological evidence on the associations of PFAS and diabetes is inconsistent. We performed this comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis to quantitatively synthesize the evidence. The findings of this study suggest that exposure to PFAS may increase diabetes risk among the general population.

We conducted a search matching specific keywords that was independently reviewed by two authors on two databases (EMBASE and PubMed) from their inception through July 19, 2022 following PRISMA guidelines.Recent FindingsWe identified a total of 28 eligible observational studies that evaluated the associations between 31 different PFAS exposures and metabolomics in humans. The most common exposure evaluated was legacy long-chain PFAS. Population sample sizes ranged from 40 to 1,105 participants at different stages across the lifespan. A total of 19 studies used a non-targeted metabolomics approach, 7 used targeted approaches, and 2 included both. The majority of studies were cross-sectional (n = 25), including four with prospective analyses of PFAS measured prior to metabolomics.Most frequently reported associations across studies were observed between PFAS and amino acids, fatty acids, glycerophospholipids, glycerolipids, phosphosphingolipids, bile acids, ceramides, purines, and acylcarnitines. Corresponding metabolic pathways were also altered, including lipid, amino acid, carbohydrate, nucleotide, energy metabolism, glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, and metabolism of cofactors and vitamins. We found consistent evidence across studies indicating PFAS-induced alterations in lipid and amino acid metabolites, which may be involved in energy and cell membrane disruption.",,10.1007/s40726-023-00269-4,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,NA,,pfas exposures and the human metabolome a systematic review of epidemiological studies

Hypercaloric, high-fat diet is considered to promote the accumulation of toxic lipophilic substances in tissues, whereas the loss of body fat through caloric restriction results in a recirculation of these substances. In rats, oral administration of DDE causes the onset of tissues damage; the concomitant intake of a high-fat diet ameliorates tissues status, probably because of the entrapment of the lipophilic substance in fat depots. Recent evidence demonstrates that DDE alters the expression of metallothioneins, proteins involved in cellular defense from oxidative stress, in a diet- and tissue-specific manner. This study is aimed to verify if 2 weeks of caloric restriction after the oral DDE treatment can modify metallothionein gene expression in tissues of high-fat fed rats. Real-time PCR analysis demonstrates that metallothionein gene expression after calorie restriction is tissue-specific and strongly influenced by both previous dietary conditions and DDE exposure. To avoid misleading conclusions on the interference of toxic xenobiotics on metallothionein gene expression is particularly important to consider the tissue, the cellular conditions, and the nutritional status of the animals, especially when the protein is used as an index of cells health.",,10.1080/03601234.2022.2127594,Rats;Gene Expression,NA,,metallothionein gene expression in rat tissues response to dietary restriction after orally dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene dde exposure and highfat feeding

Adsorbents with large mesopores and high specific surface area adsorb PFAS faster, their adsorption capacities are higher, and the adsorption process are usually more effective under low pH conditions. PFAS adsorption mechanisms mainly include electrostatic attraction, hydrophobic interaction, anion exchange, and ligand exchange. Various adsorbents show promising performances but challenges such as requirements of organic solvents in regeneration, low adsorption selectivity, and complicated adsorbent preparations should be addressed before large scale implementation. Moreover, the aid of decision-making tools including response surface methodology (RSM), techno-economic assessment (TEA), life cycle assessment (LCA), and multi criteria decision analysis (MCDA) were discussed for engineering applications. The use of these tools is highly recommended prior to scale-up to determine if the specific adsorption process is economically feasible and sustainable.

The liver acts as a key target organ for toxicity within the body and is vital for regulating metabolic processes, particularly lipid metabolism. However, there is currently a significant research gap regarding the influences of PFBS on hepatic lipid metabolism, especially in individuals with different dietary statuses. Here, the objective of this research was to examine the effects of PFBS on hepatic function under different dietary conditions. The results suggested that the levels of liver injury biomarkers were significantly upregulated, e.g., transaminase (GPT, GOT), while liver lipid levels were downregulated after exposure to PFBS at concentration of 50 mu g/L for 42 days. Moreover, restricted diet further intensified the adverse effects of PFBS on the liver. Metabolomics analysis identified significant alterations in lipid-related metabolites in PFBS-induced hepatotoxicity, PFBS exposure induced a decrease in lysophosphatidylethanolamine and lysophosphatidylcho-line. PFBS exposure caused an increase in aldosterone and prostaglandin f2alpha under restricted diet. In PFBS treatment group, histidine metabolism, beta-alanine metabolism, and arginine biosynthesis were the main pathway for PFBS toxicity.

Furthermore, health risks associated with PFAS in water are outlined. Finally, researchers worldwide have investigated the strategies for the remediation and elimination of PFAS from water. Previous studies have shown that PFASs are present in various water bodies with the highest concentration detected in Germany (94-4,385 ng center dot L-1 in river and drinking waters). The findings of this review further revealed that solid-phase extraction techniques were the most preferred for sample preparation compared to liquid-liquid extraction techniques. Solid-phase extraction technique improved the limit of detection and the limit of quantification of many analytical techniques to 0.010-1.15 and 0.030-4.00 ng center dot L-1, respectively. For PFAS remediation, the adsorption method and chemical oxidation using heat-activated persulfate and photochemical oxidation were the most used techniques.

Here, the PFOA-associated effects on immune system were evaluated in Ruditapes philippinarum using integrated analysis of metabolomes, microbiomes, and transcriptomes, providing evidence for possible mechanisms related to immunotoxicity. PFOA exposure caused clear variation in several important metabolites related to immune regulatory function within the haemolyph from R. philippinarum, while also altering key metabolic pathways, including those of lipids, unsaturated fatty acids (UFAs), and bile acids (BAs). After exposure to PFOAs, intestinal bacterial communities also clearly changed, with the predominant microflora becoming Mycoplasma and Bacteroidetes that are related to intestinal inflammation. Molecular analyses provided consistent results, wherein the expression of immune related genes was significantly altered. Integration of the multi-'omics' analyses suggested that the TLR/MyD88/ NF-kB pathway, along with PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathway, PPAR-mediated lipid metabolism and the autophagy signaling pathway, likely play important roles in initiating immunotoxic effects in R. philippinarum after PFOA exposure.

By analyzing 111 papers published between 2006 and 2022, we provide a systematic review of the pollution of PFASs in surface water environments in China. The results show that 26 PFASs contaminants were detected at least once in China's surface water environment and were mainly concentrated in the eastern part of China. Most surface water environments in China had mean PFASs concentrations below 100 ng/L. The most polluted place was the Xiaoqing River, where sampling results in 2020 showed PFASs concentrations as high as 25,429 ng/L, followed by the Tangxun Lake, the Xi River, the Daling River, the Majia River, the Baiyangdian Lake, the Liuxi River, the Jiaolai River, the Tuo River and the Zhimai River.

We excluded studies that only evaluated obesity measures at the time of birth. A full-text review and quality assessment of the studies was performed using the Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) criteria. Forest plots were created to summarize measures of association and assess heterogeneity across studies by chemical type and exposure timing. Funnel plots were used to assess small-study effects.ResultsWe identified 24 studies, of which 19 used a cohort design. There were 13 studies included in the meta-analysis examining various chemicals and outcomes. Overall prenatal exposures to four different types of PFAS were not statistically associated with changes in body mass index (BMI) or waist circumference. In contrast, for three chemicals, postnatal exposures were inversely related to changes in BMI (i.e., per log10 increase in PFOS: BMI z-score of -0.16 (95\% CI: -0.22, -0.10)). There was no substantial heterogeneity in the reported measures of association within prenatal and postnatal subgroups. We observed modest small-study effects, but correction for these effects using the Trim and Fill method did not change our summary estimate(s).ConclusionOur review found no evidence of a positive association between prenatal PFAS exposure and pediatric obesity, whereas an inverse association was found for postnatal exposure.

The evidence of the EPs' presence focuses on the detection of them, but there is a gap in information regarding is biomonitoring and their effects in health in Mexico. The presence of these pollutants in the country associated with lack of proper regulations in the discharge and disposal of EPs. Therefore, this review aims to provide a comprehensive view of the current environmental status, policies, and frameworks regarding Mexico's situation. The review also highlights the lack of information about biomonitoring since EPs are present in water even after their treatment, leading to a critical situation, which is high exposure to humans and animals. Although, technologies to efficiently eliminate EPs are available, their application has been reported only at a laboratory scale thus far. Here, an overview of health and environmental impacts and a summary of the research works reported in Mexico from 2014 to 2023 were presented.

The microbial communities in the environment are immensely diverse and critical mediators of various ecosystem processes. But it is not clearly known to what extent xenobiotics effect the composition and functionality of environmental microorganisms, across biomes in different geographic locations, with varying contaminating sources, categories of chemical pollutants, and their application types. Here, we investigated the impact of xenobiotics by meta-genomic analysis of 16S rRNA from seawater, soil, sludge and sediment, for deciphering microbial diversity, community structure, functional enrichment and metabolic potentiality in relation to the application of pesticide (metaldehyde), herbicide (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid; DCPAA), insecticide (chlordecone) and flame retar-dant additives (organophosphate triesters; OPT and tris 2 chloroethyl phosphate; TCEP). Firmicutes was the most abundant phylum consisting of Clostridia, in association with DCPAA (Lutispora sp.), metaldehyde and TCEP treatments.

Different sampling events, WWTPs across the world, different treatment technologies, configurations, and processes, as well as different PFAS classes and compounds were considered. This study evaluated 13 PFAS analyzed predominantly in 161 WWTPs across the world. The statistical test results revealed that these 13 frequently detected and reported PFAS can be divided into four groups based on their behavior during wastewater treatment, namely (1) C6-10 perfluorocarboxylic acids (PFCAs), (2) C4,5,11,12 PFCAs, (3) C4,6,8 perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs), and (4) C10 PFSA. In this study, biological treatments such as (1) membrane bioreactors, (2) combination of two or more biological treatments, and (3) biofilm processes revealed the highest PFAS removals, although the addition of a tertiary treatment actually had a nonbeneficial effect on PFAS removal.

The results confirmed that m/z 251 was the only precursor ion of dicofol after in-source fragmentation, and m/z 139 and m/z 111 were reasonable product ions. The main factors triggering the in-source fragmentation were the H+ content and solution conductivity when dicofol entered the mass spectrometer.

Although PFAS generally exert a low toxicity on plants at environmentally relevant concentrations, they frequently impact biomass growth and photosynthetic activity at higher levels. Uptake, translocation, and toxicity of PFAS in plants have been well covered in literature. Although less attention has been given to the molecular mechanisms underlying the plant response to PFAS, recent studies based on -omics approaches indicate that PFAS affects the plant metabolism even a low concentration. The objective of this review is to summarize the current knowledge about the effects of PFAS on plants at the molecular level.

The presence of PFAS in ground and surface water can create a route for PFAS to enter the soil, exposing ecosystems (including agroecosystems), where they will move through the food web via biomagnification. The toxicity of PFAS to plants, particularly in agricultural ecosystems, is of emerging concern due to the application of biosolids that are often contaminated with PFAS. Nevertheless, due to the low concentrations of PFAS in most agricultural soils, the direct impact of PFAS on plant health is not well understood. We used H-1-nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics to explore the effects of exposure of two key PFAS, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid, on Arabidopsis thaliana, a model organism. We found that Arabidopsis exhibited an accumulation of multiple metabolites, including soluble sugars (glucose and sucrose), multiple amino acids, and tri-carboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediates, suggesting that PFAS exposure impacts the metabolism of plants by causing an accumulation of stress-related amino acids and soluble sugars that drives increased activity of the TCA cycle.

Pesticide toxicity and bioaccumulation have brought up environmental issues, underlining the necessity for efficient removal techniques based on novel nanomaterials. Herein, biochar (BC) synthesized by using waste peels of citrus limetta embedded with green synthesized Fe2O3 nanoparticle by using green tea extract. By using PXRD analysis, the alpha phase of Fe2O3 confirmed. Endosulfan (ES) and Ethion (ET) pesticides are degraded photocatalytically using a sequential, BC@ Fe2O3 nanohybrid. At the pollutant concentration (50 mg L-1), with catalytic dose (25 mg) in acidic condition under natural sunlight, BC@ Fe2O3 showed to be extremely effective in the breakdown of pesticides. The higher removal of pesticides by BC@ Fe2O3 supported by higher value of zeta potential (-22.5 mV), enhanced surface area (74 m(2) g(-1)) and lower value of band gap (1.8 eV) as an effect of interactive characteristic and semiconducting behaviour. The fast decline in pesticide concentration followed by a gradual decrease demonstrated I-st order kinetics triggered by Langmuir adsorption.

In the past few years, there has been increasing concern about PFAS in the environment, since they are difficult to break down through natural processes, are highly persistent in humans, animals, soils and waters, and can travel long distances in surface and groundwater. This has created an increased need for PFAS analysis. Most PFAS monitoring currently takes place using field sampling and chromatographic analytical methods, which are laboratory-based and are very costly when used to monitor PFAS in the environment. Using a semi-systematic literature review approach, a comparative study is conducted in this article on the available analytical methods and sensor technologies that can be used to monitor and detect PFAS in the environment, including chromatographic, instrumentation analysis, and sensor-based methods. This study considered four critical factors for effective and efficient monitoring methods, which include the type of PFAS detected, removing background levels, determining detection limits, and identifying samples. In general, other analytical instruments are used in conjunction with chromatographic techniques for detecting both target and non-target analytes at a lower level of detection (LOD). It is shown that even though some sensor types have a low LOD, they are only useful for detecting targeted PFAS in water samples. However, sensors are an emerging technology that could be developed to enable low-cost, portable methods for the remote detection of PFAS species on-site.",,10.3390/w15203577,,NA,,a review of analytical methods and technologies for monitoring per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas in water

PFAAs are widely detected in soils from many countries worldwide and their distribution is related to the emission of the fluorine-containing organic industry. Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) are found to be the predominant PFAAs in soil. Industrial emission is the main source of PFAAs contributing 49.9\% of the total concentrations of PFAAs (Ʃ PFAAs) in soil, followed by activated sludge treated by wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) (19.9\%) and irrigation of effluents from WWTPs, usage of aqueous film-forming foam (AFFFs) and leaching of leachate from landfill (30.2\%).

Many are highly toxic and accumulate both in soil and in organisms. Their biological transformation takes place by dehalogenation, in which the halogen substituents are detached from the carbon in the organic compound by enzymes produced by microorganisms. This increases the compounds' water solubility and bioavailability, reduces toxicity, and allows the resulting compound to become more susceptible to biodegradation. The microbial halogen cycle in soil is an important part of global dehalogenation processes. The aim of the study was to examine the potential of microbial communities inhabiting natural and anthropogenically modified environments to carry out the dehalogenation process. The potential of microorganisms was assessed by analyzing the metagenomes from a natural environment (forest soils) and from environments subjected to anthropopression (agricultural soil and sludge from wastewater treatment plants). Thirteen genes encoding enzymes with dehalogenase activity were identified in the metagenomes of both environments, among which, 2-haloacid dehalogenase and catechol 2,3-dioxygenase were the most abundant genes. Comparative analysis, based on comparing taxonomy, identified genes, total halogens content and content of DDT derivatives, demonstrated the ability of microorganisms to transform HOCs in both environments, indicating the presence of these compounds in the environment for a long period of time and the adaptive need to develop mechanisms for their detoxification.

Many stakeholders, including regulators, scientists, non-governmental organizations, and concerned individuals could benefit from an efficient way to access the health and toxicological literature related to PFAS. Objective: To create a systematic evidence map of the available peer-reviewed health or toxicological research for 29 PFAS. Methods: A protocol for conducting this systematic evidence map was initially published on Zenodo (Pelch et al. 2019c), then peer reviewed and published in Environment International (Pelch et al. 2019d) PubMed database was searched through January 25, 2021. Studies were screened for inclusion and exclusion according to the Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) statement. Inclusion criteria were intentionally broad and included any human, animal, and/or in vitro study that investigated exposure to one of the 29 PFAS of interest and a human health or toxicological effect. Selected study details were extracted from included studies as described in the protocol. Study appraisal was not conducted. The included studies and extracted meta-data are freely available in the online, interactive systematic evidence map at https://pfastoxdatabase.org. Results: Over 15,000 studies were retrieved from the PubMed literature searches.

An over-reliance on their application to crops to control pests can disturb ecosystems. Therefore, the scientific community and policymakers must be aware of the commitment and active stance they need to take up to effectively elaborate on solutions toward mitigating environmental contamination over the coming few years. We, therefore, reviewed the academic literature on bioremediation from 2018 to 2021 (the latest year of complete publication) to provide a meta-analysis of microbial systems capable of dissipating pesticides from agricultural soils. Natural attenuation can control lindane; however, it is time-consuming and unconvincing to scale. By introducing a suite of microorganisms into the system for substrate-specific biodegradation, we can boost the bioprocess and ultimately level up its cost-effectiveness. Options of microorganisms for bioaugmentation include the fungus Trametes versicolor and the bacteria Pigmentiphaga spp. and Paenanthrobacter spp. Bioaugmentation and biostimulation are enablers of environmental reclamation in agroecosystems. However, those biocatalytic strategies can be costly while manifesting as degraders to ecological sustainability. For instance, allochthonous and recombinant microorganisms can reduce genetic diversity by promoting antagonistic relationships. In addition, some stimulant minerals can be more toxic and harmful to beneficial non-target organisms than the target pesticide. Prudence and safety are significant aspects of ensuring environmentally safer applications for pesticide-degrading approaches. Therefore, our analytical insights can provide knowledge to progress the field's prominence in developing high-throughput microbiological removal of hazardous active compounds from agricultural soils.",,10.1007/s11157-022-09637-w,Pesticides,NA,,microbial bioremediation of pesticides in agricultural soils an integrative review on natural attenuation bioaugmentation and biostimulation

However, evidence from current researches is limited and inconsistent. Thus, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the potential associations comprehensively. We systematically and extensively searched two electronic databases (PubMed and EMBASE) from inception to July 3, 2022 and an updated search was performed before submission. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95\% confidence intervals (CIs) were derived from stratified random-effects meta-analyses by type of exposure and outcome. We also tested the potential heterogeneity across studies, conducted sensitivity analysis and evaluated publication bias. A total of 20 studies were finally included in our study. Meta-analytical effect estimates indicated a positive association between prenatal exposure to PCB138, PCB-153 and PCB-170 and an increased risk of ASD, with OR of 1.89 (95\% CI = 1.21-2.95, I2 = 0\%), 1.61 (95\% CI = 1.05-2.47, I2 = 0\%) and 1.46 (95\% CI = 1.03-2.06, I2 = 0\%) respectively. In contrast, PFDA was found inversely associated with the risk of ASD (OR = 0.70, 95\% CI = 0.52-0.94, I2 = 0\%). The level of evidence supporting a link between ASD risk and exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153, PCB-170, and PFDA was respectively categorized as low, low, moderate, and low. In summary, this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that exposure to PCB-138, PCB-153, and PCB-170 correlates with a heightened risk of ASD, with evidence levels rated as ``low{''}, ``low{''}, and ``moderate{''}, respectively. In contrast, PFDA exposure appears to be inversely associated with ASD risk, with a ``low{''} level of supporting evidence.

Exposure to PFOS may alter gut microbiota and liver metabolic homeostasis in tammals, thereby increasing the risk of cardiometabolic diseases. Diets high in soluble fibers can ameliorate metabolic disease risks. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to test the hypothesis that soluble fibers (inulin or pectin) could modulate he adverse metabolic effects of PFOS by affecting microbe-liver metabolism and interactions. METHODS: Male C57BL/6J mice were fed an isocaloric diet containing different fibers: a) inulin (soluble), h) pectin (soluble), or c) cellulose (control, insoluble). The mice were exposed to PFOS in drinking water (3 ttgig per day) for 7 wk. Multi-omics was used to analyze mouse liver and cecum contents. RESULTS: In PFOS-exposed mice, the number of differentially expressed genes associated with atherogenesis and hepatic hyperlipidemia were lower in those that were fed soluble fiber than those fed insoluble fiber. Shotgun metagenomics showed that inulin and pectin protected against differences in microbiome community in PFOS-exposed vs. control mice. It was found that the plasma PFOS levels were lower in inulin-fed mice, and there was a trend of lower liver accumulation of PFOS in soluble fiber-fed mice compared with the control group. Soluble fiber intake ameliorated the effects of PFOS on host hepatic metabolism gene expression and cecal content microbiome structure. DISCUSSIONS: Results from metabolomic, lipidomic, and transcriptomic studies suggest that inulin- and pectin-fed mice were less susceptible-to PFOS-induced liver metabolic disturbance, hepatic lipid accumulation, and transcriptional changes compared with control diet-fed mice. Our study advances the understanding of interaction between microbes and host under the influences of environmental pollutants and nutrients. The results provide new insights into the microbe-liver metabolic network and the protection against environmental pollutant-induced metabolic diseases by highfiber diets.",,10.1289/EHP11360,Transcriptome;Dietary Fiber;Mice,NA,,metabolomic lipidomic transcriptomic and metagenomic analyses in mice exposed to pfos and fed soluble and insoluble dietary fibers

However, few studies have considered their combined effects, which would be more representative of PFAS occurring in the environment. In this study, zebrafish embryos were exposed to a mixture of 18 PFAS at three environmentally relevant concentrations for 5 days to assess their bioconcentration and metabolic consequences. The burdens of n-ary sumation PFAS in zebrafish larvae were 0.12, 1.58, and 9.63 mg/kg in the 0.5, 5, and 50 mu g/L treatment groups, respectively. Exposure to the PFAS mixture accelerated hatching and larval heart rates, increased energy expenditure, and reduced ATP levels and glucose contents due to decreased feed intake and glucose uptake. Metabolomic analysis revealed that exposure to the PFAS mixture enhanced glycolysis but inhibited phospholipid synthesis, and significantly increased the expression of lipid metabolism related genes (srebf1, acox, and ppar alpha), which indicated enhanced beta-oxidation. The significant changes in mitochondrial membrane potential, mitochondrial content, and the transcription of genes involved in the mitochondrial respiratory chain (mfn2, ndufs1, atp5fa1, and mt-nd1) and mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription (18rs-rrn, and polg1) suggested that exposure to the PFAS mixture could cause mitochondrial dysfunction and further disrupt glucose and lipid metabolic pathways, ultimately causing metabolic disorders in zebrafish larvae.

The abundance of glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle metabolites was decreased in PFOAtreated cells except for succinate, whereas most of amino acids were more abundant. Beside serine and glycine, the levels of metabolites derived from 13C glucose were reduced in PFOA-treated cells, and the pentose phosphate pathway flux was 1.4-fold higher in PFOA-treated cells than in the controls. In reductive glutamine pathway, higher labeled enrichment of citrate, malate, fumarate, and succinate was observed for PFOA-treated cells. The contribution of glucose to fatty acid synthesis in PFOA-treated cells decreased while the contribution of glutamine to fatty acid synthesis increased. Additionally, synthesis of TCA intermediates from fatty acid beta-oxidation was promoted in PFOA-treated cells.

L. and Beestrum, Molly and Brown, Oluwateniola and Cichowski, Sara",,,,,"Pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), such as pelvic organ prolapse (POP), anal incontinence (AI), and lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTSs), affect approximately 1 in 4 women in the United States. Many women endure PFD symptoms without seeking care. The Andersen's health behavior model explains health service utilization (HSU) using 4 domains: (1) individual needs for care, (2) resources or enabling factors, (3) predisposing factors, and (4) macrostructural/contextual factors. This study aims to apply this model to PFDs to determine the rate of HSUs in American women experiencing PFDs. The secondary objective was to examine HSU behavior using a variation of Andersen's model: the authors limited outcome variables to that of accessing PFD health services by any health care provider. As the normal Andersen's health behavior model covers broad personal health practices and general health behavior, this modification allowed for increased precision of individual predictors and relevance to urogynecology. Following PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses) guidelines, the authors conducted a systematic review of literature on PubMed, using search terms relevant to PFDs (in addition to disparities in care access). Included were studies of community-dwelling PFD symptomatic women living in the United States and quantitative and qualitative studies with primary and/or secondary aims addressing care-seeking or HSU behavior. For this study, PFDs were defined as AI, LUTSs, and POP. Extracted data were as follows: first author's last name, study aim, year of publication, study population geographic location, study participant demographics, PFD types, insurance, number of care-seekers and/or non-care-seekers, participant age, race/ethnicity, education, income, employment, body mass index, general health status, language used in study, symptoms, and other barriers and/or promotors identified. Overall, 44 publications were found that met the criteria of the study. Of these, 36 were quantitative, 5 were qualitative, and 3 were mixed-methods studies. The predominant focus of these studies was LUTSs (33/44 studies), whereas only 2 were on POP, 5 onmultiple PFDs, and 4 onAI. More than half were publishedmore than a decade ago (25/44), and themajority were based on self-reporting to national surveys. Women with symptomatic PFDs exhibited a 37\% pooled prevalence of HSU, with determinants identified across the first 3 domains in the model only (macrostructural domains associated with HSU were not identified). For the first domain, quantitative studies demonstrated that PFD symptom severity and duration and preexisting depression were individual care needs associated with greater HSU behavior. Consistent with the quantitative data available in this study, qualitative data also demonstrated that facilitators of HSU were (1) longer symptom duration and (2) negative impact of PFD on quality of life. For the resources domain, established primary or secondary care and social support/networks increased HSU behaviors, but (oddly) higher income and employment were barriers to care. Of note, home remedy utilization was identified as a barrier to HSU in this category (taking of herbal supplements, use of diapers, and other self-management strategies). Predisposing factors noted to increase HSU in this study were age older than 50 years. Minority women were not well represented in this analysis, but notably, Asian women were significantly less likely to demonstrate HSU related to PFD. Qualitatively, there were no differences in socioeconomic status of women who did or did not show HSU, but the most common facilitator was awareness of PFD treatments, and common barriers included misinformation and normalization of pelvic floor symptoms. Limitations of this study include the possibility of missed publications with relevance (such as articles involving interstitial cystitis, sexual dysfunction, birth trauma, and others, as they are important aspects of PFDs). However, the team focused on studies related to common PFDs and their HSU, as opposed to peripheral analyses or pelvic floor conditions. Second, the study may be limited by using counts of themes and numbers of reporting studies in the overall qualitative analysis. Finally, significant heterogeneity in the studies indicates caution should be used in interpreting the operating room and pooled HSU rate for each identified determinant. The study indicates that designing inclusive interventions, building upon previous research frameworks, and addressing multilayered factors are all required for improving care-seeking rates of women with PFDs. To mitigate the glaring inequity in the United States of access to pelvic floor care, the authors recommend research focused on HSU for patients with POP or AI, implementation of multifaceted interventions, and investigations into macrostructural factors affecting HSU.",,10.1097/OGX.0000000000001115,United States;Pelvic Floor;Health Services,NA,,barriers and promotors to health service utilization for pelvic floor disorders in the united states systematic review and metaanalysis of qualitative and quantitative studies

Therefore, understanding the metabolic changes caused by PFOA exposure is of great significance to protect pregnant women from its adverse effects. In this study, the metabolomes from the urine samples of pregnant women exposure to PFOA at different degrees were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS. The samples in different groups were distinguished and the differential metabolites were screened based on the VIP value, FC, and P-value of each comparison group through multivariate statistical analysis. The pathways related to differential metabolites were searched to reveal the effects of PFOA exposure on metabolic changes in pregnant women at different degrees. Finally, the ROC of differential metabolites was performed, and the differential metabolites with large area under the curve (AUC) values were selected and compared to identify the mutually differential metabolites. Meanwhile, these metabolites were fitted with a multivariable to explore if they could be used to distinguish different groups. The quantitative comparison of mutually differential metabolites revealed that the levels of L-cysteine, glycine, and 5-aminovaleric acid were positively correlated with the degree of PFOA exposure, indicating that different degrees of PFOA exposure could affect the synthesis or degradation of GSH and change the metabolism of oral or intestinal microbiota. Additionally, they may cause oxidative stress and abnormal fat metabolism in pregnant women.

Thus we performed the present systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodsRandomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational studies comparing InterTAN with proximal femoral nail anti-rotation (PFNA), the Asian PFNA (PFNA-II), or the Gamma3 nail in treating IFF were searched on PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library from inception to April 30, 2023. The differences in perioperative parameters and clinical and radiological outcomes were evaluated by mean difference (MD) with 95\% confidence interval (95\%CI). The risks of various complications and mortality were assessed by risk ratio (RR) with 95\%CI.ResultsTwenty-three studies comprising 3566 patients were included. Compared with single-screw cephalomedullary nails (PFNA/PFNA-II, Gamma3), InterTAN conferred significantly reduced risk of implant failures (RR = 0.37, 95\%CI 0.26 to 0.51, P < 0.001), hip and thigh pain (RR = 0.70, 95\%CI 0.55 to 0.90, P = 0.006) and all-cause revision/reoperation (RR = 0.38, 95\%CI 0.26 to 0.57, P < 0.001). Moreover, patients treated with InterTAN had significantly higher 1-year Harris Hip Score (MD = 0.82, 95\%CI 0.20-1.44, P = 0.010) and shorter time to union/healing (MD = - 0.66 days, 95\%CI - 1.16 to - 0.16, P = 0.009). Femoral neck shortening, time to full bearing, and incidences of non-union, infection, deep venous thrombosis, and mortality were comparable between both groups.ConclusionsThe integrated dual-screw InterTAN construct has superior performance in reducing risks of complications and improving clinical and functional outcomes in the treatment of IFF.

In the early 2020s, the need for personal protection due to the COVID-19 pandemic led to increased consumption of plastic materials (e.g., facemasks and gloves) and ultimately to increased plastic pollution, especially by PMFs. The PMFs present in the environment may be released in this form (primary particles) or in larger materials, that will release them as a result of environmental conditions. Although a considerable number of studies have been addressing the effects of microplastics, most of them studied round particles, with fewer studies focusing on PMFs. Thus, the current study aimed to summarize and critically discuss the available data concerning the ecotoxicological impact of PMFs on aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms exposed to PMFs showed accumulation, mainly in the digestive tract, and several toxic effects, such as DNA damage, physiological alterations, digestive damage and even mortality, suggesting that PMFs can pose a risk for the health of aquatic organisms. The PMFs induced toxicity to aquatic invertebrate and vertebrate organisms depends on size, shape, chemical association and composition of fibers.

Recent studies have increasingly demonstrated that metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are capable of removing PFASs from water through adsorption techniques. However, there is still constructive discussion on the potential of MOFs in adsorbing and removing PFASs for large-scale engineering applications. This review systematically investigates the use of MOFs as adsorbents for the removal of PFAS in water treatment. This primarily involved a comprehensive analysis of existing literature to understand the adsorption mechanisms of MOFs and to identify factors that enhance their efficiency in removing PFASs. We also explore the critical aspects of regeneration and stability of MOFs, assessing their reusability and long-term performance, which are essential for large-scale water treatment applications. Finally, our study highlights the challenges of removing PFASs using MOFs. Especially, the efficient removal of short-chain PFASs with hydrophilicity is a major challenge, while medium- to long-chain PFASs are frequently susceptible to being captured from water by MOFs through multiple synergistic effects. The ion-exchange force may be the key to solving this difficulty, but its susceptibility to ion interference in water needs to be addressed in practical applications. We hope that this review can provide valuable insights into the effective removal and adsorption mechanisms of PFASs as well as advance the sustainable utilization of MOFs in the field of water treatment, thereby presenting a novel perspective.",,10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c02939,Adsorption,NA,,metalorganic frameworkbased composites for the adsorption removal of per and polyfluoroalkyl substances from water

Fold change analysis of the metabolome revealed the effect of DDT on bile acid biosynthesis. Gene expression of the related enzyme in rat liver samples was also quantified. Significant association was found between DDT and gene expression levels related to constitutive androstane receptor mediated enzymes, such as Cyp2b1 in rat livers. However, our results could not fully demonstrate that enzymes related to bile acid biosynthesis were strongly affected by DDT. The correlation between DDT concentration and gene expression involved in steroid hormone synthesis in testis was also evaluated; however, no significant correlation was found. The disturbance of metabolic enzymes occurred in rat liver in the target area. Our results suggest that DDT exposure affects gene expression in wild rats living in DDT-sprayed areas.

The objective of this research was to examine the alterations in liver transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles in offspring rats at postnatal day (PND) 30 following gestational and lactational exposure to PFOS (from gestational day 1 to 20 and PND 1 to 21). Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats were separated into a control group (3\% starch gel solution, oral gavage) and a PFOS exposure group (0.03 mg/kg body weight per day, oral gavage). Histopathological changes in liver sections were observed by hematoxylin and eosin staining. Biochemical analysis was conducted to evaluate changes in glucose and lipid metabolism. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses were utilized to identify significant genes and metabolites associated with alterations of liver glucose and lipid metabolism through an integrated multi-omics analysis. No significant differences were found in the measured biochemical parameters. In total, 167 significant differ-entially expressed genes (DEGs) related to processes such as steroid biosynthesis, PPAR signaling pathway, and fat digestion and absorption were identified in offspring rats in the PFOS exposure group. Ninety-five altered metabolites were exhibited in the PFOS exposure group, such as heptaethylene glycol, lysoPE (0:0/18:0), lucidenic acid K, and p-Cresol sulfate.

Michael and Christensen, Krista and Lin, Cynthia J. and Goldstone, Alex and ra E. and Lemeris, Courtney and Thayer, Kristina A.",,,,,"BACKGROUND: Per- and polylluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) comprise a large class of chemicals with widespread use and persistence in the environment and in humans; however, most of the epidemiology research has focused on a small subset. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n =37), endocrine (n =30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n=27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n=14), cancer (n=12), and urinary (n =11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62\%) studies were considered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PEAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PEAS may be used as replacements for ``legacy{''} PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SENT highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist.",,10.1289/EHP11185,,NA,,epidemiology evidence for health effects of 150 per and polyfluoroalkyl substances a systematic evidence map

V. and de Noronha, M.",,,,,"Objective: This systematic review investigated whether people with patellofemoral osteoarthritis (PFOA) have muscle strength, volume, and activation around the hip and knee that is different from asymptomatic controls. Methods: Searches were carried out in five electronic databases, with terms related to PFOA, including muscle strength, volume and activation. Only studies with at least one group with symptomatic PFOA and one asymptomatic group were included. The methodological quality of the studies was assessed using the Downs and Black checklist. Certainty of evidence was assessed using the GRADE methodology. Using the random effects model, a meta-analysis was performed when there were at least two studies reporting the same domain. Results: Eight studies (250 participants) met the inclusion criteria. Subjects with PFOA had weaker hip abduction (SMD -0.96; 95\%CI = -1.34 to -0.57), hip external rotation (-0.55;-1.07 to -0.03), hip extension (-0.72;-1.16 to -0.28), and knee extension (-0.97;-1.41 to -0.53) when compared to asymptomatic controls.

Improving the proprioception of PFMs, defined as the capacity to know the status and position of each body part, and adequately contracting them could be a protective factor to prevent the appearance of PFDs in the general female population. This study aimed to identify the effectiveness of educational interventions and verbal instructions on how to contract and exercise the PFMs to improve the proprioception of the PFMs in women. A systematic search of studies published in the last 20 years until March 2022 was conducted in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Scopus, PEDro, Lilacs, and Dialnet databases. A meta-analysis could not be performed due to the heterogeneity in the types of studies and included populations. This review followed the PRISMA guidelines for the design, search, and reporting of studies. The methodological quality was analysed via the PEDro and the Newcastle-Ottawa scales in the case of randomised clinical trials and non-randomised studies, respectively, while the quality of evidence was determined using the SIGN grading system for evidence-based guidelines. Descriptive and experimental studies published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese that evaluated the contractile capability of the PFMs in healthy women or women without a previous diagnosis of PFD were included. Seven articles that included a total of 2507 women were found, three of which were clinical trials with PEDro scores between 5 and 9 points out of 10 and four of which were non-randomised studies with NOS scores between 6 and 8 points out of 10. The outcomes were measured through vaginal palpation, visual observation, questionnaires for PFD symptoms, and self-perception reports. This review discriminated between two types of intervention, educational programmes and verbal instructions, and evaluated the changes observed in PFM strength and knowledgeability and the symptoms of PFDs. The findings showed that educational interventions and verbal instructions improve the proprioception of PFMs in women of all ages that are healthy or without a previous diagnosis of PFDs as well as their knowledge about the pelvic floor, healthy lifestyle habits, and symptoms that are potentially indicative of PFDs.

After exposure to mPFASs, the silkworm midgut was enriched with high levels of PFASs, which induced histopathological changes. The composition of the midgut microbiota was significantly affected by mPFAS exposure, and functional predictions revealed significant disruption of some metabolic pathways. RNA-seq analysis revealed that mPFASs significantly changed the transcription profiles. Functional enrichment analysis of the differentially expressed genes also revealed that biological processes related to metabolic pathways and the digestive system were significantly affected, similar to the results of the gut microbiota analysis, suggesting that mPFAS exposure had an adverse effect on the metabolic function of silkworms and may further affect their normal growth. Finally, the significant correlation between abundance changes in the gut microbiota and metabolism/digestion-related genes further highlighted the role of the gut microbiota in mPFAS-related processes affecting the metabolic functions of silkworms.

However, the mechanisms responsible for the impact of ED on PCa and the role of proteins in this process are not yet well understood. Here, two complementary computational approaches have been employed to investigate the molecular processes underlying the acquisition of malignancy in prostate cancer. First, the metabolic reprogramming associated with the chronic exposure to Aldrin in DU145 cells was studied by integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics via constraint-based metabolic modeling. Second, gene set enrichment analysis was applied to determine (i) altered regulatory pathways and (ii) the correlation between changes in the transcriptomic profile of Aldrin-exposed cells and tumor progression in various types of cancer.

Exposure of omega-6 fatty acids to an oxidative environment results in the generation of a highly reactive carbonyl species known as trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). The timely and efficient detoxification of this metabolite, which has actions comparable to other reactive carbonyl species, such as 4-hydroxynonenal, acrolein, acetaldehyde, and methylglyoxal, is essential for disease prevention. However, the detoxification mechanism for tt-DDE remains elusive. In this study, the enzyme Aldh9a1b is identified as having a key role in the detoxification of tt-DDE. Loss of Aldh9a1b increased tt-DDE levels and resulted in an abnormal retinal vasculature and glucose intolerance in aldh9a1b-/- zebrafish. Transcriptomic and metabolomic analyses revealed that tt-DDE and aldh9a1b deficiency in larval and adult zebrafish induced insulin resistance and impaired glucose homeostasis. Moreover, alterations in hyaloid vasculature is induced by aldh9a1b knockout or by tt-DDE treatment can be rescued by the insulin receptor sensitizers metformin and rosiglitazone. Collectively, these results demonstrated that tt-DDE is the substrate of Aldh9a1b which causes microvascular damage and impaired glucose metabolism through insulin resistance. Omega-6 fatty acids, prevalent in Western diets, are oxidized to form trans, trans-2,4-decadienal (tt-DDE). This study reveals ALDH9a1b as a novel detoxifying system for tt-DDE, confirmed by a CRISPR KO line.

In this study, human fecal samples were used to model the microbial population of the colon, to test whether these anaerobic microbes could facilitate 8:2 monosubstituted PAP (monoPAP) transformation. In vitro testing was completed by incubating the fecal samples with 8:2 monoPAP (400-10,000 nM) up to 120 minutes in an anaerobic chamber. Reactions were then terminated and the samples prepared for GC- and LC-MS/MS analysis.

The gut microbiome also produced a unique composition of oxidative metabolites, where the following intermediate metabolites were more abundant than terminal PFCAs: 8:2 fluorotelomer unsaturated carboxylic acid (FTUCA) > 8:2 fluorotelomer carboxylic acid (FTCA) > 7:2 Ketone approximate to perfluorohexanoic acid (PFHxA). Hydrolytic and oxidative metabolites contributed up to 30\% of the molar balance after microbial 8:2 monoPAP transformation. Together, the results suggest that the gut microbiome can play a notable role in PAP biotransformation.",,10.1039/d2em00225f,Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Biotransformation;Surface-Active Agents,NA,,the human fecal microbiome contributes to the biotransformation of the pfas surfactant 82 monosubstituted polyfluoroalkyl phosphate ester

Outcomes reviewed included age; gender; indications; pathology; functional evaluations; surgical outcomes and complications.Results Fifteen papers met our inclusion criteria, accounting for 394 patients. Endoscopic or robotic FTS was carried out for benign and malignant thyroid lesions, with or without central neck dissection. Nodule size and thyroid lobe volume did not exceed 6, 10 cm, respectively. FTS reported comparable outcome with transaxillary or oral approaches about operative time, complication rates or drainage features. The mean operative time ranged from 88 to 220 min, depending on the type of surgery (endoscopic vs robotic hemi- or total thyroidectomy). Conversion to open surgery was rare, occurring in 0-6.3\% of cases. The most common complications were earlobe hypoesthesia, hematoma, seroma, transient hypocalcemia and transient recurrent nerve palsy.

This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to decipher the precise relationship between SSS and AF, further exploring and comparing different therapy strategies on the occurrence or progression of AF in patients with SSS. Methods and results: A systematic literature search was conducted until November 2022. A total of 35 articles with 37,550 patients were included. Patients with SSS were associated with new-onset AF compared to those without SSS. Catheter ablation was associated with a lower risk of AF recurrence, AF progression, all-cause mortality, stroke and hospitalization of heart failure compared to pacemaker therapy. Regarding the different pacing strategies for SSS, VVI/VVIR has higher risk of new-onset AF than DDD/DDDR. No significant difference was found between AAI/AAIR and DDD/DDDR, as well as between DDD/DDDR and minimal ventricular pacing (MVP) for AF recurrence. AAI/AAIR was associated with higher risk of all-cause mortality when compared to DDD/DDDR, but lower risk of cardiac death when compared to DDD/DDDR. Right atrial septum pacing was associated with a similar risk of new-onset AF or AF recurrence compared to right atrial appendage pacing. Conclusion: SSS is associated with a higher risk of AF. For patients with both SSS and AF, catheter ablation should be considered. This meta-analysis re-emphasizes that high percentage of ventricular pacing should be avoided in patients with SSS in order to decrease AF burden and mortality.",,10.1016/j.ijcard.2023.03.066,Atrial Fibrillation;Sick Sinus Syndrome,NA,,association between sick sinus syndrome and atrial fibrillation a systematic review and metaanalysis

Additionally, data regarding prevalence of lumbar disc degeneration and back pain in competitive swimmers were synthesized.SynthesisFour studies were included in the final analysis. Study quality and risk of bias were deemed adequate. There was significant heterogeneity among studies (I2 = 0.74) regarding data collected, population of swimmers, sample size, and methods. Therefore, a meta-analysis was not conducted. The majority of the studies included in this study (three of four) reported that swimmers have increased odds of developing lumbar DDD. Additionally, secondary outcome analysis indicated that swimmers have a higher probability of developing moderate-to-severe back pain.ConclusionCompetitive swimming appears to be associated with the presence of DDD on advanced imaging and moderate-to-severe back pain. These findings are limited by significant differences in study methodology in the included studies. Although swimming is conventionally considered a low-impact sport, elite swimmers risk developing lower back pain and disc pathology, possibly because training involves unique biomechanics with repetitive rotational and hyperextension/flexion of the spine. Further research investigating risk factors involving biomechanics of swimming on the spine may have important implications for stroke technique, injury prevention, and rehabilitation for swimmers.",,10.1002/pmrj.13138,Risk Assessment,NA,,assessing the risk of lumbar degenerative disc disease associated with swimming a systematic review

Drug-induced platelet function bleeding disorders are the most frequent PFDs and can easily be identified on the basis of recent administration of platelet-inhibiting drugs. Apart from these, the most challenging acquired PFDs are those caused by autoimmune mechanisms. In fact, demonstration of autoantibodies inhibiting platelet function may be difficult in most non-specialised centres. Among autoimmune PFDs (aPFDs), acquired Glanzmann thrornbasthenia (aGT), which is caused by autoantibodies that bind to platelet alpha llb beta 3 integrin, inhibiting its function, is the most frequent. aGT can be associated with underlying haematological malignancies or autoimmune diseases but can also be idiopathic. More rarely, other immune-mediated PFDs can occur, such as acquired delta storage pool disease (a delta SPD). Treatment of aPFDs must rely on the control of acute and chronic bleedings, treatrnent of the under lying disease in secondary forms, and immunosuppressive treatment for autoantibody reduction or eradication. aPFDs may completely resolve upon treatment of any underlying disease that may be present. In primary aPFDs, and in the majority of secondary forms, treatment relies on immunosuppressive therapies. Here we present a systematic review of previously described immune-mediated aGT and a delta SPD cases. Clinical and laboratory characteristics, treatments for the control of bleedings and for the eradication of autoantibodies, and responses to treatments are also discussed.

However, their gastrointestinal biology (lack of stomach) has limited their acid-peptic digestion, acid lysis of plants and invertebrate tissues, and phosphorus uptake. This review presents data from 118 articles on the use of plant-based feed additives (PFAs) in Cyprinus carpio (common carp). Our review shows that most PFA research in carp is focused on improving feed and nutrient utilization efficiency along various levels (in vivo digestibility, metabolizability to in situ nutrient loading), while other half is focused on ensuring animal welfare standards (biomass, immunity, welfare). Several reviewed plant-based additives however tend to do both. The PFAs include essential oils (EOs), plant-part extracts (PPEs), medicinal plants (herbs) and spices. The effective inclusion rate of EOs is lower (0.5\%-0.75\%). Whereas PPEs, herbs and spices work at a generic inclusion rate of 2\%-5\% in carp feeds. Even at an optimum inclusion rate, there are factors controlling PFAs efficacy such as methods of preparation (reviewed). PFAs like lemon beebrush, geranium, dill, Rosemary pepper and common mallow with/without certain pre-conditions are better to avoid in cyprinid diets. Although certain PFAs may potentially alter organoleptic qualities of carp flesh or might assist in training carp immunity, information on these aspects is limited.

Aim The purpose of this retrospective study, therefore, was to assess the peri-prosthetic fracture rate and failure rates of elderly neck of femur (NOF) fractures implanted with either a short or long proximal femoral nail (PFN). Materials and methods A retrospective study was conducted in a single orthopaedic department (University Hospital Dorset, Poole, GBR) using collected data on all extracapsular neck of femur fracture patients from the national hip fracture database (NHFD) from January 1, 2011, to December 23, 2021. The data collected included patient age, sex, the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) type of neck of femur fracture, type of surgery performed, any further peri-prosthetic fractures, and time to re-operation in that subset of the group. The implants used were the Stryker Gamma 3 Nail and the Smith Nephew (Trigen and Intertan). All patients were allowed to fully weight bear as tolerated and received both orthopaedic and elderly medical care. Failure was defined as a cut-out or implant fracture. Results From January 1, 2011, to December 23, 2021, there were 1010 extracapsular neck of femur fractures recorded on the National Hip Fracture Database (NHFD) treated with a PFN from the study centre. Of those patients, 11 had pathological fractures and were excluded. 649 patients had long PFNs, and 350 had short PFNs. Of the total of 999 patients, 254 (25\%) were male and 745 (75\%) were female. More than 80\% of the patients in the sample were over the age of 75. The majority of patients in both groups had A1/A2 fractures (short 84.3\%, long 49.1\%). The rate of periprosthetic fractures in the short PFNs was 1.71\%, and the failure rate was 0.57\%. The rate of periprosthetic fractures in the long PFNs was 0.62\%, with a failure rate of 0.92\%. The multi-nominal logistic regression model did not show statistically significant odds ratios (OR) for the following variables: long/short nails, male/female gender, age, ASA, or type of fracture. The female gender was associated with a higher risk of both periprosthetic fractures and failures (OR of 2.232 and 2.95), but this was not found to be statistically significant. Similarly, unstable A3 fractures had a much higher risk of failure (OR of 2.691) compared to periprosthetic fractures (OR of 0.985). However, this was not statistically significant. Conclusion Overall, this study has identified that in a patient population that is predominantly female and over the age of 75, the risk of periprosthetic fracture rate and the failure rate is similar in both the use of a short or a long PFN for intertrochanteric fractures.",,10.7759/cureus.32892,Cohort Studies;Nails;Hip Fractures,NA,,periprosthetic fractures in long versus short proximal femoral nailing for intertrochanteric fractures a 10year singlecentre cohort study

These chemicals are eventually taken up by aquatic organisms, where they can cause harmful effects. However, knowledge gaps related to the connections between hydrological, chemical, and biological processes currently limit our ability to forecast potential future changes in contaminant concentrations accurately. In this study, concentrations of three pesticide classes (organochlorines, organophosphates, and herbicides) and a standard suite of trace metals were analyzed in the South Saskatchewan River, Canada in 2020 and 2021 in water, sediments, and fishes. Organochlorine pesticides have been banned in Canada since the 1970s, yet there were some detections for methoxychlor and lindane, predominantly in sediment and fish samples, which could be attributed to legacy contamination. Except for malathion and parathion, organophosphate pesticides were scarcely detected in both sampling years in all matrices, and neonicotinoids were below detection in all samples. Conversely, the herbicides 2,4-D and dicamba were detected consistently throughout all locations in water samples for both sampling years. Overall, concentrations were 3 times higher in 2020 when river discharge was similar to 2 times higher, suggesting run-off from the surrounding catchment or disturbance of contaminated sediments. Analysis for trace metals revealed that Cu and Zn exceeded sediment quality guidelines in some locations. Mercury concentrations exceeded the guidelines for about 18\% of the samples (water and sediment) analyzed.

This study examined the effects of root exudates produced from dicot (Arabidopsis thaliana) and monocot (Brachypodium distachyon) grown under different nutrient conditions (nutrient -rich, sulfur -free, and potassium -free) on 6:2 FTOH biotransformation with or without bioaugmentating agent Rhodococcus jostii RHA1. All the exudates enhanced defluorination of 6:2 FTOH by glucose -grown RHA1. Amendment of dicot or monocot root exudates, regardless of the plant growth conditions, also enhanced 6:2 FTOH biotransformation in soil microcosms. Interestingly, high levels of humic-like substances in the root exudates are linked to high extents of 6:2 FTOH defluorination. Bioaugmenting strain RHA1 along with root exudates facilitated 6:2 FTOH transformation with a production of more diverse metabolites. Microbial community analysis revealed that Rhodococcus was predominant in all strain RHA1 spiked treatments. Different root exudates changed the soil microbiome dynamics.

After many years of development, DDT has been extended to geological investigation and disaster management for tunnel engineering, aquifer reconstruction at the bottom of coal mines, pumping channel construction for power storage stations, municipal pipeline laying and other fields. Combined with the advantages of DDT for long-distance accurate crossing, ground grouting technology can achieve safe and efficient management of underground engineering disasters, and has a broad application prospect. This paper systematically reviews the development history, research status and key technologies of DDT. Firstly, the development history of DDT is introduced. Secondly, the scientific research plan, academic paper publication, relevant patent authorization, and application exploration of DDT are analysed. The analysis results show that the DDT in China has reached an internationally advanced level of technological independence and broad-range application, but there are still some core technical problems that need to be resolved, such as thousand-meter long-distance fast drilling, accurate drilling guidance in complex geological conditions, and accurate grouting in underground engineering. Focusing on the construction requirements of strategic major projects, this paper proposes four functional modules, i.e., forecasting, drilling, grouting and detecting, and analyses and discusses six aspects of ultra-long directional drilling and grouting (i.e., sensing prediction while drilling, rapid drilling and sticking prediction, precision guidance technology, remote gel controllable grouting material, pressure stabilizing and controlling sectional grouting process, and detection system with drilling).

In the present study, a sensitive and rapid high-performance thin-layer chromatography method was developed for the simultaneous determination of marmelosin, umbelliferone, and psoralen from the four different aerial parts of A. marmelos. The method uses HPTLC silica gel 60 RP-18 W plates as stationary phase, and acetonitrile: 0.1\% orthophosphoric acid in water (1:1 v/v) as solvent system. The developed method is validated for specificity, precision, repeatability, and accuracy in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Further, the estimation of heavy metal suggested that the A. marmelos bark sample was highly contaminated with cadmium (3.8 +/- 0.7 mu g/g) which was far from the permissible range as described by World Health Organization (WHO). The observed chromium concentration was higher in the bark and the fruit than the normal range recorded in the plants.

Nevertheless, these conventional techniques have several limitations, involving complicated pre-treatment steps, requiring expensive instruments, operational difficulty, lack of instrument portability, and difficulties in real-time monitoring. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) is one of the current leading techniques widely applied for the ultrasensitive detection of pesticides molecules. SERS takes advantage to combine the high specificity of Raman scattering with the signal amplification of electromagnetic enhancement provided by the excitation of surface Plasmon resonances in metallic nanostructures, together with the charge transfer mechanisms established between metal surfaces and analytes. In this brief review, types of classification of pesticides that can be classed have been reported. These classifications can provide valuable information on the chemistry of pesticides.

However, its utilisation is hampered by the presence of micropollutants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated dibenzodioxins (PCDDs), polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDFs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Previous studies indicate that the type and amount of micropollutants can be significantly adjusted by selecting the right process parameters. This literature review provides an overview of how (1) pyrolysis temperature, (2) carrier gas flow and type, (3) heating rate, and (4) residence time affect the concentration of micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge. The micropollutants targeted are those listed by the European Biochar Certificate (EBC) and by the International Biochar Institution (IBI), including PAHs, PCDD/Fs, PCBs and VOCs. In addition, per- and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are also considered due to their presence in sewage sludge. The findings suggest that higher pyrolysis temperatures reduce micropollutant levels. Moreover, the injection of a carrier gas (N2 or CO2) during the pyrolysis and cooling processes effectively lowers PAHs and PCDD/Fs, by reducing the contact of biochar with oxygen, which is crucial in mitigating micropollutants. Nevertheless, limited available data impedes an assessment of the impact of these parameters on PFAS in biochar. In addition, further research is essential to understand the effects of carrier gas type, heating rate, and residence time in order to determine the optimal pyrolysis process parameters for generating clean biochar.",,10.1016/j.wasman.2023.12.036,"Conditioning, Operant",NA,,micropollutants in biochar produced from sewage sludge a systematic review on the impact of pyrolysis operating conditions

For this, graphene materials have grown in interest due to their unique and appreciable characteristics. Thus, this study aims to perform a systematic review of previous studies which evaluated the use of graphene materials as support means for cobalt FTS catalysts. Twelve studies from the last five years were selected for extraction and analysis of results. The main parameters that influenced the catalytic activity of FTS catalysts were discussed, such as the type of support used, the chosen preparation method, and the graphene functionalization method. The results showed that the catalysts synthesized from different types of graphene support obtained CO conversion rates between 20 and 86.9\% and high selectivity for C5 + compounds in the gasoline range. Furthermore, the functionalization of graphene with functional groups and pretreatment with nitric acid was essential to adjust the metal-support interaction and ensure catalytic efficiency.

The traditional preferred surgical approach for pelvic floor disorders (PFDs) is vaginal hysterectomy (VH) with or without pelvic floor repair. Uterine pathology treatments via hysterectomy for women, including premalignant conditions and fibroids, typically opt for the VH route. A shorter recovery time and faster return to daily activities have been associated with VH, as this procedure leaves no large abdominal incision (which may produce further wound-related complications and higher levels of pain during the recovery process). A proposed preemptive anesthetic modality aimed at minimizing postoperative pain (as well as narcotic and opioid consumption) is the application of infiltration of local anesthetics during pelvic floor reconstructive surgeries. This study aimed to evaluate infiltration of local anesthetics and their impact on perioperative outcomes for women, as well as postoperative pain for patients undergoing VH for the surgical management of PFDs. Abstract selection took place via 3 authors (A.P., A.D., and D.Z.), who used the following meta-analysis inclusion criteria: randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing outcomes of patients undergoing VH due to PFDs and/or other benign indications (ie, fibroids, uterine bleeding, precancerous conditions) and received either intraoperative infiltration with local analgesic or not. Comparator groups consisted of VH-eligible patients who received placebo injections of normal saline solution in place of local anesthetic. Main outcomes of the study were postoperative pain scores and opioid use. Excluded studies were any case reports, nonrandomized trials, or animal studies. The databases searched for articles published up to January 2022 included MEDLINE (1966-2022), Scopus (2004-2022), Cochrane CENTRAL Register of Controlled Trials, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases. Authors retrieved the full text of those studies deemed to meet the criteria. Overall, 5 RCTs were included in the analysis. Their data included 277 women who underwent a VH, with the local analgesia (LA) group patients, or those receiving preemptive local infiltration analgesia, consisting of 139 patients, whereas the control group (patients in the non-LA group who received no preemptive LA) included 138 patients. The main analgesic regimen was 0.5\% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 epinephrine followed by 0.5\% ropivacaine. Total anesthetic injection amounts ranged from 20 to 50 mL from study to study. In addition, injection sites exhibited variation, but the uterosacral ligaments were the most prevalent sites of local analgesic injection. Also, opioid-based consumption up to 24 hours postoperatively was significantly reduced in the LA group when compared with the non-LA group (197 patients). Overall, the average postoperative scores at both 30 minutes to 2 hours and 3 to 6 hours postoperatively were significantly lower in the LA group when compared with the non-LA group. Despite this, the postoperative pain scores later up to 24 hours postoperatively did not differ between groups. A major strength of the study was the authors' choice to set aside data restrictions to eliminate data losses. This study is the first to present outcomes from existing RCTs of local infiltration analgesia use before surgical incision during VH. Limitations of the study include a limited number of existing studies from which data were pulled, thereby hindering the ability to draw safe conclusions. The relatively small level of evidence could hinder accurate summaries of local anesthetic effects, with the possibility of overestimation/underestimation on the identified effects. The authors included some studies that were not yet published at the time of review. An additional weakness was the variation of the methodological quality of recruited studies due to design differences, included populations, and methodology. Significant heterogeneity was detected in areas such as analgesic regimens utilized, injected dosage, injection locations, and indication for surgery. Preemptive application of LA in patients undergoing VH for PFDs appears as a safe and beneficial use of anesthetic in terms of hospital stay, opioid use, and short-term postoperative pain. However, additional studies would be required to identify dosages, the optimal anesthetic regimen, and application sites to achieve the peak postoperative benefit.",,10.1097/OGX.0000000000001118,"Anesthetics, Local;Hysterectomy, Vaginal;Hysterectomy",NA,,preemptive infiltration of local anesthetics during vaginal hysterectomy a systematic review and metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials

We found that, despite an increasing trend in the number of published studies, the geographical coverage is still very limited and most of the studies focused solely on trace elements (70.8\%). Among sharks, Rhincodon typus was the most represented species (66.7\%), while Mobula mobular the most studied ray species (41.7\%). Comparing the levels of pollutants in filter feeders between ocean basins, this review highlighted that Hg, As and Cd levels are mostly higher in those areas affected by both strong natural and anthropogenic source of emissions, such as the Indian Ocean.

The objective of the present study was to characterize the metabolic profiles underpinning the associations between POPs and endometriosis risk. Methodology: A hospital-based case-control study was conducted in France to recruit women with and without surgically confirmed deep endometriosis. Women's serum was analyzed using gas and liquid chromatography coupled to high -resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) to measure the levels of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), organochlorinated pesticides (OCPs) and per-/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). A comprehensive metabolomic profiling was conducted using targeted HRMS and 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) to cover polar and non -polar fractions. A ``meet -in -the -middle{''} statistical framework was applied to identify the metabolites related to endometriosis and POP levels, using multivariate linear and logistic regressions adjusting for confounding variables. Results: Fourteen PCBs, six OCPs and six PFAS were widely found in almost all serum samples. The pesticide trans-nonachlor was the POP most strongly and positively associated with deep endometriosis risk, with odds ratio (95 \% confidence interval) of 2.42 (1.49; 4.12), followed by PCB180 and 167. Women with endometriosis exhibited a distinctive metabolic profile, with elevated serum levels of lactate, ketone bodies and multiple amino acids and lower levels of bile acids, phosphatidylcholines (PCs), cortisol and hippuric acid. The metabolite 2hydroxybutyrate was simultaneously associated to endometriosis risk and exposure to trans-nonachlor. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive metabolome-wide association study of endometriosis, integrating ultra -trace profiling of POPs.

In this study, embryos and adult zebrafish were exposed to PCP to determine its potential neurotoxic mechanism and protective indicators. The survival rate, heart rate, mobility time, active status and moving distance were significantly decreased in larvae after 30 mu g/L PCP exposure. Likewise, the mobile time, latency to the first movement, velocity and moving distance of adult zebrafish were significantly reduced by PCP exposure. Untargeted metabolomics analysis of larvae revealed that arginine and proline metabolism was the primary pathway affected by PCP exposure, reflected by increased proline and decreased citrulline (CIT) contents, which were confirmed by quantitative data. PCP exposure suppressed the conversion from arginine to CIT in larvae by downregulating the expression of nos1 and nos2a. Ornithine content was increased in the brains and intestines of adult zebrafish after PCP exposure, which inhibited ornithine catabolism to CIT by downregulating otc, resulting in reduced CIT. Intriguingly, CIT supplementation significantly restored the neurobehavioral defects induced by PCP in larvae and adult zebrafish. CIT supplementation upregulated the expression of ef1 alpha and tuba1 in larvae and inhibited the downregulation of ef1 alpha in the brains of adult zebrafish.

This has led to the development of new analytical and multi-class analysis methods for the assessment of a broad range of organic pollutants in various population groups, ranging from small-scale studies to advanced studies with a large number of participants based on different exposure settings. This meta-analysis summarizes the existing literature on the assessment of organic pollutants in hair in terms of residue levels, the correlation of hair residue levels with those of other biological matrices and socio-demographic factors, the reliability of hair versus other biomatrices for exposure assessment, the use of segmental hair analysis for chronic exposure evaluation and the effect of external contamination on hair residue levels. Significantly high concentrations of organic pollutants such as pesticides, flame retardants, polychlorinated biphenyls and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon were reported in human hair samples from different regions and under different exposure settings. Similarly, high concentrations of pesticides (from agricultural activities), flame retardants (E-waste dismantling activities), dioxins and furans were observed in various occupational settings. Moreover, significant correlations (p < 0.05) for hair and blood concentrations were observed in majority of studies featuring pesticides and flame retardants. While among sociodemographic factors, gender and age significantly affected the hair concentrations in females and children in general exposure settings, whereas adult workers in occupational settings. Furthermore, the assessment of the hair burden of persistent organic pollutants in domestic and wild animals showed high concentrations for pesticides such as HCHs and DDTs whereas the laboratory-based studies using animals demonstrated strong correlations between exposure dose, exposure duration, and measured organic pollutant levels, mainly for chlorpyrifos, diazinon, terbuthylazine, aldrin, dieldrin and pyrethroid metabolites.

Micro-plastics and nano-plastics remain major emerging pollutants and threaten the environment, ecosystem, human health, and well-being. Micro-nanoplastics (MNPs) are also exposed to humans through cosmetics, inhalation, ingestion, drinking water, dietary sources, and drug formulations. Oral uptake is the major among the different exposure routes of MNPs to humans. After entry, it gets absorbed due to its nano size (<100 nm) and easily distributed to all parts of the body through blood, affecting multiple organs, especially vital organs of the human body leading to severe diseases. It causes cancer, heart, liver, and kidney diseases, crosses the blood-brain barrier, and affects the brain. Its adsorption with protein leads to multi-layered corona formation in human blood plasma. MNPs interact with immune cells and induce pro-inflammatory mediators, inflammatory reactions, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and associated cytotoxicity. MNPs suppress T lymphocyte activity which results in a lack of immune regulation leading to autoimmune diseases. Hence, it is necessary to understand the impact of MNPs exposure on humans.

However, the impacts of various bromide ion (Br-) concentrations on the phytotoxicity, uptake and fate of SAs in plant growth and physiological metabolism of plants have not been well understood. Our research demonstrated that low concentrations of Br- (0.1, 0.5 mM) promoted the uptake and degradation of sulfadiazine (SDZ) in wheat and attenuated the phytotoxicity of SDZ. Additionally, we proposed a degradation pathway and identified the brominated product of SDZ (SDZBr), which attenuated the dihydrofolate synthesis inhibition by SDZ. The primary mechanism was that Br-reduced the level of reactive oxygen radicals (ROS) and alleviated oxidative damage. The production of SDZBr and the high consumption of H2O2 suggest the potential generation of reactive bromine species, contributing to the degradation of the electron-rich SDZ and thus reducing its toxicity. Moreover, metabolome analysis of wheat roots indicated that low concentrations of Br- stimulated the production of indoleacetic acid under SDZ stress, promoting growth and enhancing the uptake and degradation of SDZ. Conversely, high Br- (1 mM) concentration produced a deleterious effect.

Microplastic pollution has emerged as a global concern in marine environments and a danger to animals, predators, and humans because it has been discovered in the marine environment all over the world. This review examines the quantity of MP samples around the world and their colonization by marine microorganisms, as well as the detection, features, origins, and ecological implications of paint fragments and resins in our oceans and ports. These polymers are derived from paints and the fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) matrix used in shipbuilding. Microplastics should be regarded as coming from synthetic polymers found in ship coatings.

In this study, first, the concentration and characteristics of MPs in secondary wastewater effluent, and the influential variables related to the coagulation process, for MPs removal were identified using systematic reviews of previous studies. Then, the most proper MPs characterization and coagulation variables were chosen by experts' opinions using a fuzzy Delphi method. Therefore, the experiment tested in conditions close to the full-scale wastewater treatments. Finally, in the laboratory removal of MPs by coagulation of polyamide (PA), polystyrene (PS), and polyethylene (PE), < 125 and 300-600 mu m in size, was tested by a jar test applying Al-2(SO4)(3) in doses of 5 to 100 mg/L plus 15 mg/L polyacrylamide as a coagulant aid. Using R and Excel software, the results were analyzed statistically. It was concluded that the maximum and minimum removal efficiency was 74.7 and 1.39\% for small PA and large PE, respectively.

The toxicity of florfenicol (FF) and polystyrene microplastics (PS-MPs) on rice seedlings was investigated. FF and PS-MPs caused colloidal agglomeration, which changed the environmental behavior of FF. FF inhibited rice growth and altered antioxidant enzyme (superoxide dismutase, peroxidase, and catalase) activities, leading to membrane lipid peroxidation; impaired photosynthetic systems, decreased photosynthetic pigments (Chlorophyll a, Chlorophyll b, and carotene), chlorophyll precursors (Proto IX, Mg-Proto IX, and Pchlide), photosynthetic and respiratory rates. The key photosynthesis related genes (PsaA, PsaB, PsbA, PsbB, PsbC, and PsbD) were significantly down-regulated.

The results show that microplastics are widespread in lake water and sediment. There are obvious geographical differences in the occurrence of microplastics. The abundance of microplastics in different lakes varies greatly. The forms are mostly fibrous and fragments, and the main polymers are polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE). Previous papers have failed to comment in as much detail on the microplastic sampling techniques employed within lake systems. The sampling and analysis methods are critical to accurately evaluating contamination results. Due to the widespread presence of microplastics and the lack of uniform standards, there are various sampling methods. Trawls and grabs are most widely used in the sampling of lake water bodies and sediment, and sodium chloride and hydrogen peroxide are the most widely used media for flotation and digestion, respectively.

As most AMU in Canada is related to animal agriculture, there is a need to reduce overall AMU, which could be accomplished through surveillance of AMU in animal agriculture, including the dairy industry. The objective of this study was to quantify AMU on dairy farms across Canada. This study had two parts: a description of data collected in 2019-2020, and a meta-analysis comparing this data to previous estimates of AMU in the Canadian dairy industry. The first included a garbage can audit (GCA) on 107 farms in four Canadian provinces (British Columbia, Alberta, Ontario, and Nova Scotia) in 2020; AMU data were converted to the dose-based metrics of defined course doses (DCD) and defined daily doses (DDD). Mixed-effect linear models were fit to determine the relationship between province and use of different classes of antimicrobials. On average, for every 100 animals on the farm, 117 DCD of antimicrobials were administered per year (IQR: 55, 158). These treatments amounted to 623 DDD / 100 animal-yr (IQR: 302, 677 DDD/100 animal-years). Penicillins were the most used class of antimicrobials, followed by first-and third-generation cephalosporins. Farms in Ontario used more third-generation cephalosporins than other provinces.

Current studies mainly focused on the individual effects of microplastics or antibiotics on methane generation. However, there may also be complex reactions between them and their combine effects on anaerobic digestion remain unclear. This study revealed the combined influencing mechanism of polyamide and ofloxacin through batch and semi-continuous tests. Brief exposure to ofloxacin was detrimental to methane production. The coexistence of polyamide enabled partial adsorption of ofloxacin, which effectively mitigates the inhibitory effect of ofloxacin at low concentrations. Polyamide also facilitated the colonization of hydrolytic bacteria and acidogens, such as Hydrogenispora, and promoted the conversion of organic matter to acetate. However, polyamide could not effectively alleviate the inhibitory effect of excess ofloxacin on anaerobic digestion. Ofloxacin at high concentrations stimulated the release of humic acid, reduced methane production by more than 80\%, and changed the predominant methanogenesis pathway from acetoclastic methanogenesis to hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis. Acidogenesis and methanogenesis pathways were restructured to further explore the effect of ofloxacin on the metabolic potentials of microorganisms. Metagenomic analysis revealed that most of functional genes associated with glycolysis, amino acid metabolism and methanogenesis were down regulated under longterm stress of high concentration of ofloxacin.

This work comprehensively revealed the hormesis effects of PHMG occurred in waste activated sludge (WAS) on the generation of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during anaerobic fermentation. The low level of PHMG (100 mg/g TSS) significantly promoted the VFAs generation (1283 mg COD/L, compared with 337 mg COD/L in the control) via synchronously facilitating the solubilization, hydrolysis, and acidification steps but inhibiting methanogenesis. Metagenomic analysis showed that the functional anaerobe ( i.e., Bacteroides, Macellibacteroide and Parabacteroide) and corresponding genetic expressions responsible for extracellular hydrolysis (i.e., clpP), membrane transport (i.e., ffh and gspF), intracellular substrates metabolism (i.e., ald and paaF) and VFAs biosynthesis (i.e., ACACA and FASN) were enhanced in the optimal presence of PHMG. Moreover, the anaerobic species could respond and adapt to low PHMG stimuli via quorum sensing (i.e., cqsA, rpfC and rpfG), and thus maintain the high microbial metabolic activities.

This study explores the potential of Chrysopogon zizanioides (Vetiver) and Colocasia esculenta (Taro) in mitigating pharmaceutical and personal care products (PPCPs)- metronidazole (MNZ), naproxen (NAP), and methylparaben (MeP), under hydroponic conditions. Both plants demonstrated similar specific uptake potentials for the target pollutants (5.23 to 5.76 mg/g of biomass dry weight), with pollutant accumulation in plants remaining very low (<10 \%). Notably, a substantial fraction of pollutants (66.27 \% to 78.42 \%) underwent metabolism. Qualitative analysis identified five MNZ and NAP metabolites and six MeP metabolites in plant tissues. Over a 28-day PPCPs exposure, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) resulted in reduced chlorophyll content, root activity, protein, and carbohydrates, alongside increased oxidative stress levels. The study highlighted distinct accumulation patterns, with NAP (anion) primarily in roots and MeP (cation) and MNZ (neutral) predominantly in aerial parts. Phloroglucinol staining confirmed the intact endodermis (Casparian Strips) in Vetiver roots, indicating symplastic transport of PPCPs to aerial parts. Moreover, significant morphological alterations were observed in plant roots exposed to target pollutants. During recuperation, a decrease in accumulated ROS indicates partial self-recovery from oxidative damage. In conclusion, both Vetiver and Taro emerge as promising candidates for removing specified PPCPs, emphasizing the critical role of addressing emerging contaminants for sustainable development and preserving the environment and human wellbeing.",,10.1016/j.cej.2024.149180,Naproxen;Metronidazole,NA,,fate of pharmaceuticals and personal care products like metronidazole naproxen and methylparaben and their effect on the physiological characteristics of two wetland plants

This study proposed corroborating this trend, analyzing the available literature on the subject to verify how experts in the AOP area investigated this integration during 2015-2023. For this purpose, a sample of publications was treated by applying the Systematic Review (SR) methodology. This resulted in an extract of 83 studies that adopted life-cycle logic to estimate environmental impacts and process costs or evaluated them as complementary to the technical dimension of each treatment technology. This analysis found that both dimensions can be used for selecting or sizing AOPs at the design scale. However, the appropriate choice of the impact categories for the environmental assessment and establishing a methodology for cost analysis can make the approach still more effective. In addition, a staggering number of processes would broaden the reality and applicability of the estimates, and adopting multicriteria analysis methodologies could address essential aspects of decision-making processes during the design of the arrangements.

Although substantial studies have explored the dynamics and threats of microplastics in BCEs, the fate and driving factors of microplastics in BCEs on a global scale remain largely unknown. Here, the occurrence, driving factors, and risks of microplastics in global BCEs were investigated by synthesizing a global metaanalysis. The results showed that the abundance of microplastics in BCEs has notable spatial differences worldwide, with the highest microplastic concentrations in Asia, especially in South and Southeast Asia. Microplastic abundance is influenced by the vegetation habitat, climate, coastal environment, and river runoff. The interaction of geographic location, ecosystem type, coastal environment, and climate enhanced the effects of microplastic distribution. In addition, we found that microplastic accumulation in organisms varied according to feeding habits and body weight. Significant accumulation was observed in large fish; however, growth dilution effects were also observed. The effect of microplastics on the organic carbon content of sediments from BCEs varies by ecosystem; microplastic concentrations do not necessarily increase organic carbon sequestration. Global BCEs are at a high risk of microplastic pollution, with high microplastic abundance and toxicity driving the high pollution risk.

In contrast, the impacts of nonantibiotic drugs have been largely overlooked, and their regulation mechanism in anammox system remains unclear. In this study, the single and combined effects of typical antibiotic (doxycycline) and non-antibiotic drug (propranolol) on anammox consortia were evaluated and compared from process performance, community succession, metabolic and gene regulation perspectives. Significant reduction in the nitrogen removal efficiency (49.0 +/- 0.5\%) was only observed in the anammox process stressed by propranolol and doxycycline, but it was reversible. Metabolome results showed that anammox consortia upregulated amino acid metabolism under propranolol stress, while the abundance of pyrimidine and purine metabolic pathways significantly increased under doxycycline and multidrug stress. Microorganisms adapted to these stresses by changing the utilization preference for metabolites. Metagenomic analyses indicated that doxycycline and propranolol induced the high frequency of gene transfer through increasing oxidative stress level, membrane permeability, pili and efflux pumps. Significant correlations between ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs), especially intI1, demonstrated the conjugative transfer of ARGs. Furthermore, structural equation models showed that microbial community, bacterial metabolism, MGEs, reactive oxygen species (ROS) and corresponding SOS response were key driving factors for ARGs transfer in the anammox systems.

Benzophenone-8 (BP-8) is one of the main metabolites of BP-3 in organisms. Current reports show that BP-8 may be more toxic than BP-3. However, difference of their toxicities on embryonic development has rarely been reported. In this study, zebrafish embryos were chosen as the target organism to explore the developmental toxicities of BP-3 and BP-8. Non-targeted metabolomic analysis was performed to compare their modes of action. Results showed that BP-8 exposures led to higher bioaccumulation and lower hatching rate of zebrafish larvae than BP-3. Both BP-8 and BP-3 exposures caused behavioral abnormalities of zebrafish larvae, but no significant difference was found between them. At the metabolome level, 1 mu g/L BP-3 and 1 mu g/L BP-8 exposures altered neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction pathway and FoxO signaling pathway, respectively, which might be involved in the abnormal behaviors in zebrafish larvae. For higher exposure groups (30 and 300 mu g/L), both BP-3 and BP-8 exposures changed metabolism of cofactors and vitamins of zebrafish larvae. Exposure of BP-3 altered the metabolism by pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis pathway, while BP-8 exposure changed riboflavin metabolism and folate biosynthesis.

Ibuprofen (IBP), as a typical anti-inflammatory drug, is frequently detected in water sources. Therefore, its removal using various adsorbents has drawn great interest. Herein, the structural, electronic, energetic, and optical properties of pristine oxo-triarylmethyl (oxTAM) and transition metal-doped oxo-triarylmethyl (TM@oxTAM, TM = Sc, Ti, V, Cr, and Mn) for adsorption of the IBU drug were investigated using density functional theory (DFT) calculations implemented in Gaussian and VASP codes. Frontier molecular orbital (FMO), density of states (DOS), and electronic band structure results demonstrated that transition metaldoped oxTAM causes a significant reduction in the energy band gap (Eg) value of pristine oxTAM, with the highest decrease (30.14 \%) in the case of Mn@oxTAM. It was found that transition metal doping onto oxTAM leads to an increase in the adsorption energies (1.20-2.64 eV) and charge density between transition metal and IBU. Natural bond orbital (NBO) analysis revealed that charge was effectively transferred from the IBU towards the transition metal, which was further analyzed by charge decomposition analysis (CDA). Furthermore, quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM), interaction region indicator (IRI), electron localization function (ELF), and radial distribution function (RDF) analyses revealed that the IBU is adsorbed on the Sc@oxTAM surface via covalent interactions, while electrostatic with partially covalent interactions are dominated in other IBU/TM@oxTAM complexes. The results suggest that TM doping on the oxTAM provides a new insight for developing photocatalyst-based covalent organic frameworks (COFs) to remove emerging pollutants in wastewater.",,10.1016/j.jmgm.2023.108647,Adsorption;Ibuprofen,NA,,theoretical design of transition metaldoped oxotriarylmethyl as a disposable platform for adsorption of ibuprofen

This study demonstrated that the up-regulation of ferroptosis associated proteins genes were accompanied with the down-regulation of AMPKa2 phosphorylation in DOX treated mouse heart or neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). AMPKa2 knockout (AMPKa2-/-) significantly exacerbated mouse cardiac dysfunction, increased mortality, promoting ferroptosis associated mitochondrial injuries, enhanced ferroptosis associated proteins and genes expression, and lead to accumulation of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and malondialdehyde (MDA) in mouse serum and hearts respectively.

The main way to deal with this insect is to use insecticides. Due to the resistance from insecticides, the fight against house flies has been hampered. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies worldwide.Methods: This study was conducted via a systematic review and meta-analysis to investigate the prevalence of knockdown resistance against organochlorine insecticides in house flies. Accord-ingly, by searching the databases of Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Proquest, Bioone, and Embase, all published articles were extracted, and reviewed until the end of May 2022.

Fishes are the main group of organisms studied in aquatic toxicology, and their behaviours, including feeding, courtship, parental care, and territoriality, are essential to their health. Cichlids are one of the most abundant fish families and are both economically and ecologically relevant. In this review, we found that metals, pesticides, pharmaceutical products, and endocrine disruptor chemicals are the main groups of pollutants that have been studied in the context of cichlid behaviour. African tilapias are the most evaluated cichlids on this topic, and Nile tilapia was the most frequently studied species. Exposure to these pollutants has been shown to affect cichlid fish behaviours in aspects including erratic swimming, activity versus inactivity, preference for the bottom and/or the surface of the tank, aggressiveness, feeding, predation, and reproduction. Oxidative stress, failures in neurotransmission, energetic imbalances, and histopathological damage are among the most common mechanisms underlying the behavioural changes. It is necessary to establish a set of integrative criteria for evaluating the ecotoxicological behaviour of cichlid fish, given the current lack of standardised methods. It is also important to consider more pollutants-both individually and in combination-such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons, flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers, perfluoroalkyl substances, and microplastics, due the increasing relevance of these pollutants of emerging concern.

In this study, we aim to develop a nanoparticle-imprinted hydrogel (NPIH, NANOGEL) to detect and capture NPs in water samples. The principle of the Nanogel originates from the well-known concept of molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs). Cadmium sulfide/Selenide/Zinc sulfide core/shell quantum dots (QDs) were used as the template NP, creating specific pore cavities in the Nanogel that can selectively bind to certain analytes. Quantification of NPs detected in water samples was then made possible by transducing this selective detection process into an analytical signal using a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM). The Nanogel was shown to demonstrate good repeatability, reproducibility, and stability in terms of its performance. The high selectivity of the Nanogel was determined to be attributed to the size of cavities and their surface characteristics. Ionic interference was present and, heavy metal cations showed an affinity for the NANOGEL synthesized; however, they were demonstrated to be minimized by the selection of porogenic solvents during the synthesis of NANOGEL.

MPs are emerging pollutants in croplands and water systems with significant ecological risks, particularly over the long term. In the soil systems, MPs polymer type, thinness, shape, and size induces numerous effects on soil aggregates, dissolved organic carbon (C), rapidly oxidized organic C, microbial biomass C, microbial biomass nitrogen (N), microbial immobilization, degradation of organic matter, N cycling, and production of greenhouse gas emissions (GHGs), thereby posing a significant risk of impairing soil physical and biochemical properties over time. Further, toxic chemicals released from polyethylene mulching (PMs) might indirectly harm plant growth by affecting soil wetting-drying cycles, releasing toxic substances that interact with soil matrix, and suppressing soil microbial activity. In the environment, accumulation of MPs poses a risk to human health by accelerating emissions of GHGs, e.g., methane and carbon dioxide, or directly releasing toxic substances such as phthalic acid esters (PAEs) into the soils. Also, larger sizes MPs can adhere to root surface and block stomata could significantly change the shape of root epidermal cells resulting in arrest plant growth and development by restricting water-nutrient uptake, and gene expression and altering the biodiversity of the soil pollutants. In this review, we systematically analyzed the potential risks of MPs to the soil-plant and human body, their occurrence, abundance, and migration in agroecosystems. Further, the impacts of MPs on soil microbial function, nutrient cycling, soil C, and GHGs are mechanistically reviewed, with emphasis on potential green solutions such as organic materials amendments along with future research directions for more ecofriendly and sustainable plastic management in agroecosystems.",,10.1016/j.scitotenv.2023.165688,,NA,,ecological risks of microplastics contamination with green solutions and future perspectives

In the present study, a novel aerobic denitrifying phosphate-accumulating bacterial strain RL-GZ01 was found to be able to utilize phthalic acid esters (PAEs) as carbon resource for cell growth. Based on 16S rRNA gene analysis, physiological and biochemical characterization, and genome-based average nucleotide identity calculation, RL-GZ01 was identified as Rhodococcus pyridinivorans. Strain RL-GZ01 showed high DEHP degradation in alkaline conditions and good tolerance of salinity and organic solvents. The degradation of DEHP by RL-GZ01 fitted well with a modified Gompertz model (R-2 = 0.9985). Metabolic intermediates of DEHP were identified via UHPLC-MS/MS analysis and the catabolic pathway was proposed thereafter. Genes and gene clusters contributed to the utilization of DEHP were analyzed through genomic analysis. Analysis of KEGG nitrogen metabolism pathway indicated that nitrate and nitrite were further transformed into ammonium which was further used for the biosynthesis of L-glutamine and L-glutamate. Strain RLGZ01 was further identified as a denitrifying phosphate accumulating organism which can accumulate phosphate by generating polyphosphate. Finally, strain RL-GZ01 was applied to municipal wastewater treatment for simultaneous removal of nitrogen, phosphate and DEHP. The removal percentages of DEHP (5 mg/L), TN (71.2 mg/L), NH4+-N (70.9 mg/L), PO43--P (10.89 mg/L) and COD (622.4 mg/L) by strain RL-GZ01 were 89.94 \%, 64.45 \%, 64.94 \%, 76.30 \% and 63.23 \% within 84 h, respectively.

Research has shown that persistent organic pollutants (POPs), including per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFASs), polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated diphenyl ethers, and phthalate metabolites, are associated with a higher risk of abnormal blood lipid levels in humans. However, the key molecules involved in dyslipidemia and the mecha-nisms are not fully understood. This study aims to investigate the biomarkers that mediate the relationships between blood lipids and four groups of POPs and revealed their potential mechanisms. Specifically, in 278 male blood samples, blood lipid and POPs levels were measured and metabolites were detected using untargeted metabolomics. Spearman's correlation analysis and binary logistic regression were employed to assess the relationship between POPs and lipid indexes. We observed that PFASs were associated with a higher risk of abnormal total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL), while other POPs displayed little association with abnormal lipid indexes. Among all the PFASs, 6:2Cl-PFESA was associated with the fewest metabolites. A metabolome-wide association study combined with a meet-in-the-middle approach was used to identify potential biomarkers that mediate the association between POPs and abnormal blood lipids. The mediation analysis pointed to 105 significant mediators as potential biomarkers mediating the association between PFASs and TC, and 82 significant mediators were potential biomarkers that mediated the association between PFASs and LDL. 24-Hydroxycholesterol, 3alpha,7alpha-dihydroxy-5beta-cholestan-26-al, PC(18:0/0:0), PC(22:5/0:0), GPCho (18:1/18:1), LysoPC(22:2(13Z,16Z)), LysoPC(16:0), 9(S)-HODE, 9,10-DHOME, L-glutamate, 4-hydroxybutyric acid, cytosine, PC(14:1(9Z)/18:0), sphinganine, and (S)-beta-aminoisobutyrate were identified as important biomarkers. The mechanism may mainly involves glycerophospholipid metabolism, primary bile acid biosyn-thesis, and linoleic acid metabolism. PPAR gamma likely plays a role in the associations between PFASs and abnormal cholesterol metabolism.

This work revealed the effects of ZPT on the volatile fatty acids (VFAs) during WAS anaerobic digestion, in which VFAs yield was enhanced by approximately 6-9 folds (from 353 mg COD/L in control to 2526-3318 mg COD/L with low level of ZPT (20-50 mg/g TSS)). The ZPT occurred in WAS enabled the acceleration of solubilization, hydrolysis and acidification processes while inhibited the methanogenesis. Also, the low ZPT contributed to the enrichment of functional hydrolytic -acidifying microorganisms (e.g., Ottowia and Acinetobacter) but caused the reduction of methanogens (e.g., Methanomassiliicoccus and Methanothrix). Meta-transcriptomic analysis demonstrated that the critical genes relevant to extracellular hydrolysis (i.e. CLPP and ZapA), membrane transport (i.e. gltI, and gltL), substrates metabolisms (i.e. fadj, and acd), and VFAs biosynthesis (i.e. porB and porD) were all upregulated by 25.1-701.3\% with low level of ZPT. Specifically, the ZPT stimulus on amino acids metabolism for VFAs transformation was prominent over carbohydrates. Moreover, the functional species enabled to regulate the genes in QS and TCS systems to maintain favorable cell chemotaxis to adapt the ZPT stress. The cationic antimicrobial peptide resistance pathway was upregulated to blunt ZPT with the secretion of more lipopolysaccharide and activate proton pumps to maintain ions homeostasis to antagonize the ZPT toxicity for high microbial activities, the abundance of related genes was up-regulated by 60.5 to 524.5\%.

Among PhACs, the anti-inflammatory ibuprofen (IBU) and the antibiotic oxytetracycline (OTC) are two of the most used compounds whose presence has been reported in different aquatic environments worldwide. However, there is still scarce information about the cellular and molecular alterations provoked by IBU and OTC on aquatic photosynthetic microorganisms as microalgae, even more if we refer to their potential combined toxicity. To test the cyto- and genotoxicity provoked by IBU, OTC and their binary combination on Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, a flow cytometric panel was performed after 24 h of single and co-exposure to both contaminants. Assayed parameters were cell vitality, metabolic activity, intracellular ROS levels, and other programmed cell death (PCD)-related biomarkers as cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potentials and caspase-like and endonuclease activities. In addition, a nuclear DNA fragmentation analysis by comet assay was carried out. For most of the parameters analysed (vitality, metabolic activity, cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membrane potentials, and DNA fragmentation) the most severe damages were observed in the cultures exposed to the binary mixture (IBU+OTC), showing a joint cyto- and genotoxicity effect. Both PhACs and their mixture caused a remarkable decrease in cell proliferation and metabolic activity and markedly increased intracellular ROS levels, parallel to a noticeable depolarization of cytoplasmic and mitochondrial membranes. Moreover, a strong increase in both caspase and endonuclease activities as well as a PCD-related loss of nuclear DNA integrity was observed in all treatments. Results analysis showed that the PhACs caused cell death on this non-target organism, involving mitochondrial membrane depolarization, enhanced ROS production and activation of PCD process.

In this systematic review, results on the link between organochlorine pesticide pollution and CVD were collected from databases (Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Science Direct) in May 2022 from studies published between 2010 and 2022. A total of 24 articles were selected for this systematic review. Sixteen articles were extracted by reviewers using a standardized form that included cross-sectional, cohort, and ecological studies that reported exposure to organochlorine pesticides in association with increased CVD risk. In addition, eight articles covering molecular mechanisms organochlorine pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on cardiovascular effects were retrieved for detailed evaluation. Based on the findings of the study, it seems elevated circulating levels of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs increase the risk of coronary heart disease, especially in early life exposure to these pesticides and especially in men. Changes in the regulatory function of peroxisome proliferator-activated gamma receptor (PPAR gamma), reduction of paroxonase activity (PON1), epigenetic changes of histone through induction of reactive oxygen species, vascular endothelial inflammation with miR-expression 126 and miR-31, increased collagen synthesis enzymes in the extracellular matrix and left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) and fibrosis are mechanisms by which PCBs increase the risk of CVD. According to this systematic review, organochlorine pesticide exposure is associated with increased risk of CVD and CVD mortality through the atherogenic and inflammatory molecular mechanism involving fatty acid and glucose metabolism.",,10.34172/aim.2023.86,Cardiovascular Diseases;Pesticides,NA,,insights into organochlorine pesticides exposure in the development of cardiovascular diseases a systematic review

We aim to explore the efficacy and indication(s) of PCD in patients with degenerative disc disease (DDD).Methods The search was conducted across Ovid MEDLINE, Ovid Embase, and PubMed. Data on study design, patient demographics, pre- and post-procedure Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) scores, and complications were extracted. Inclusion criteria focused on adult patients with degenerative spinal diseases treated with cement discoplasty. The overall effect size was evaluated using a forest plot, and heterogeneity was assessed using the I-2 statistic and chi-squared test.Results The search strategy yielded six studies, which included 336 patients (73.8\% female, 26.2\% male) with a mean average age of 74.6 years. VAS scores were reported in all studies, showing a significant difference between pre- and post-PCD pain scores (Weighted Mean Difference {[}WMD]: -3.45; 95\% CI: -3.83, -3.08; I-2 = 15\%; P < .001). ODI scores were reported in 83\% of studies, with a significant difference between pre- and post-PCD scores (WMD: -22.22; 95\% CI: -25.54, -18.89; I-2 = 61\%; p < .001). Complications reported included infections, thrombophlebitis, vertebral fractures, disc extrusion, and the need for further operations.Conclusions The analysis showed clinically significant improvements in pain and functional disability based on VAS and ODI scores. However, due to methodological limitations and a high risk of bias, the validity and generalizability of the findings are uncertain. Despite these issues, the results provide preliminary insights into PCD's potential efficacy and can guide future research to address current limitations.",,10.1177/19714009231212368,Spinal Diseases,NA,,efficacy and safety of percutaneous cement discoplasty in the management of degenerative spinal diseases a systematic review and metaanalysis

We measured contaminant concentrations in edible seaweeds (Fucus distichus, F. spiralis, and Nereocystis luetkeana) from 43 locations in the Salish Sea. Metals were analyzed in all samples, and 94 persistent organic pollutants (POPs) (i.e. 40 PCBs, 15 PBDEs, 17 PCDD/Fs, and 22 organochlorine pesticides) and 51 PAHs were analyzed in Fucus spp. We compared concentrations of contaminants to human health-based screening levels calculated from the USEPA and to international limits. We then worked with six focal contaminants that either exceeded screening levels or international limits (Cd, total Hg, Pb, benzo{[}a]pyrene {[}BaP], and PCBs) or are of regional interest (total As). USEPA cancer-based screening levels were exceeded in 30 samples for the PCBs and two samples for BaP. Cadmium concentrations did not exceed the USEPA noncancer-based screening level but did exceed international limits at all sites. Lead exceeded international limits at three sites. Because there are no screening levels for total Hg and total As, and to be conservative, we made comparisons to methyl Hg and inorganic As screening levels. All samples were below the methyl Hg and above the inorganic As screening levels. Without knowledge of the As speciation, we cannot assess the health risk associated with the As. While seaweed was the focus, we did not consider contaminant exposure from consuming other foods. Other chemicals, such as contaminants of emerging concern (e.g., PFAS, pharmaceuticals and personal care products), should also be considered.

Food contamination with pesticide residues (PRs) is a serious concern, especially in developing countries. Several research reports revealed that some Brazilian farmers spray pesticides on fruits and vegetables in large quantities, generating PRs after harvest. Thus, ingestion of food contaminated with PRs can cause adverse health effects. Based on information obtained through a systematic review of essential information from 33 articles, we studied the assessment of potential health risks associated with fruit and vegetable consumption in children and adults from Brazilian states. This study identified 111 PRs belonging to different chemical groups, mainly organophosphates and organochlorines, in 26 fruit and vegetable samples consumed and exported by Brazil. Sixteen of these PRs were above the Maximum Residue Limit (MRL) established by local and international legislation. We did not identify severe acute and chronic dietary risks, but the highest risk values were observed in Sa tilde o Paulo and Santa Catarina, associated with the consumption of tomatoes and sweet peppers due to the high concentrations of organophosphates. A high long-term health risk is associated with the consumption of oranges in Sa tilde o Paulo and grapes in Bahia due to chlorothalonil and procymidone. We also identified that 26 PRs are considered carcinogenic by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA), and the carcinogenic risk analysis revealed no severe risk in any Brazilian state investigated due to the cumulative hazard index (HI) < 1. However, the highest HI values were in Sa tilde o Paulo due to acephate and carbaryl in sweet pepper and in Bahia due to dichlorvos. This information can help regulatory authorities define new guidelines for pesticide residue limits in fruits and vegetables commonly consumed and exported from Brazil and monitor the quality of com-mercial formulations.",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138244,Risk Assessment;Pesticides,NA,,consumption of fruits and vegetables contaminated with pesticide residues in brazil a systematic review with health risk assessment

VL is transmitted by different species of sandflies and key strategies against VL rely on the control of the vectors. This systematic review assesses the efficacy and community effectiveness of indoor residual spraying (IRS) in controlling sandflies and VL occurrence among humans. After a revision of 8822 initial hits, 21 studies were included in this systematic review.Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts by up to 95\% for at least one month. DDT has been used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over time. Combinations of different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as key issues for control programmes. No human transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS on human transmission,-although by modelling studies an effect of IRS on human transmission can be demonstrated. Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) is one of the interventions to control the vectors of Visceral Leishmaniasis (VL). Different insecticides are used in affected countries, also in the Regional Initiative for the Elimination of VL in South-East Asia. This systematic review assesses all available studies analysing the effectiveness of IRS on the key vectors of VL. The systematic review followed PRISMA guidelines, with a broad search strategy, applied to seven key databases. Inclusion criteria were studies focusing on 1) Visceral leishmaniasis 2) Indoor Residual Spraying (IRS) or synonyms, and 3) all primary research methods. 21 studies were included, five cluster randomised controlled trials (cRCTs), one randomised controlled trial (RCT), 11 intervention studies, also included were three modelling studies and one survey. 19 out of 21 included studies were published between 2009 and 2020. 18 of the studies were conducted in the context of the Regional Initiative. Effects of IRS on vector populations are positive, confirmed in terms of effectiveness and by the availability of studies. Deltamethrin and alpha-Cypermethrin reduce total sandfly counts, and/or Phlebotomus argentipes counts by up to 95\% with an effect of a minimum of one month. Prolonged effects are not regularly seen. DDT has been used in India only: whereas in the 1990s a good effect could be measured, this effect waned over time. Two intervention studies, embedded in larger programmes in 2019 and 2020, replaced DDT with alpha-Cypermethrin throughout the study. Combinations of different interventions are not systematically researched, however showing some promising results, for example for the combination of IRS and Temephos. Constant monitoring of insecticide resistancies and quality delivery of IRS are confirmed as key issues for programmes. No human transmission data are available to directly relate an effect of IRS-although modelling studies confirm the effect of IRS on human transmission. Concluding, IRS continues to be an effective intervention for Phlebotomus argentipes control. Delivery requires constant monitoring and quality assurance.

Industrial park wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) treat large amounts of comprehensive wastewater derived from industrial production and park human activity, which is possible a source of ARGs and pathogens. Therefore, this study investigated the occurrence and prevalence of ARGs, ARGs hosts and pathogens and assesses the ARGs health risk in the biological treatment process in a large-sale industrial park WWTP using metagenomic analysis and omics-based framework, respectively. Results show that the major ARG subtypes are multidrug resistance genes (MDRGs), macB, tetA(58), evgS, novA, msbA and bcrA and the ARGs main hosts were genus Acidovorax, Pseudomonas, Mesorhizobium. In particular, all determined ARGs genus level hosts are pathogens. The total removal percentage of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens were 12.77 \%, 12.96\% and 25.71\% respectively, suggesting that the present treatment could not efficiently remove these pollutants. The relative abundance of ARGs, MDRGs and pathogens varied along biological treatment process that ARGs and MDRGs were enriched in activated sludge and pathogens were enriched in both secondary sedimentation tank and activated sludge. Among 980 known ARGs, 23 ARGs (e.g., ermB, gadX and tetM) were assigned into risk Rank I with characters of enrichment in the human-associated environment, gene mobility and pathogenicity. The results indicate that industrial park WWTPs might serve as an important source of ARGs, MDRGs, and pathogens.

In addition, function (e.g., CAZy, eggNOG and KEGG) is also an important biotic factor; however, how function correlates to ARGs and thus contributes to the antibiotic resistome remains ambiguous. This work explores the effect of sulfonamides (SAs) on ARGs and MGEs by a metagenomic analysis, a principal component analysis (PCA), and a nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis (NMDS). Then, the work establishes a correlation between ARGs and function with a co-occurrence network and reveals the contribution and positive (negative)/direct (indirect) effect of taxonomy, MGEs, and function to the antibiotic resistome by variation partitioning analysis (VPA) and partial least-squares-path modeling (PLS-PM). The results show that the soil has diverse ARGs and several MGEs and SAs impose significant effects on them. Further, CAZy, eggNOG, and KEGG (including pathway and orthology) show strong and significant correlation with ARGs on the basis of the co-occurrence network; however, in our system it seems that only the KEGG pathway promotes the interpretation of ARGs and should be regarded as the priority function on considering the role of function in structuring the antibiotic resistome.

This paper was aimed at performing a systematic review and meta-analysis of population studies exploring whether human male exposure to EDCs affects male fertility. Clinical and observational studies assessing the exposure to EDCs along with sperm quality, the most common reproductive disorders, sperm DNA damage, sperm oxidative stress, fertilization rate, implantation rate, clinical pregnancy rate, live birth rate, and miscarriage rate were included. The quality assessment tool from the NHLBI-NIH was used to assure that studies met standardized quality criteria. Sensitivity analysis and heterogeneity among studies was assessed. Overall, the 32 selected articles, including 7825 individuals in the systematic review, explored 12 families of EDCs. The results revealed a high heterogeneity among studies in relation to the association between exposure to EDCs and the endpoints analyzed. Meta-analyses were performed with data from 7 articles including 479 individuals, 4 articles assessing the association between BPA in urine and sperm quality, and 3 articles evaluating PCB153 in serum and sperm quality. In the meta-analysis, we identified an unpredicted significant positive association between PCB153 exposure and sperm concentration. However, it would not be clinically relevant. No positive or inverse associations were found neither for BPA, nor for PCB153 and the rest of sperm parameters analyzed. The high disparity between studies made difficult to draw conclusions on the potential harmful effects of EDCs on male fertility.

With the awareness of the impact of MPs on the environment increasing over the last years, the need for increased monitoring as well as comprehensive analysis to better understand the fate and impact of MPs has become more and more important. A major aspect of MP characterization is the assignment of the polymer type of individual particles. Here, per-and poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), originating from fluor-containing polymers, have gained a lot of attention due to the severe environmental impact. Additionally, quantitative analysis of the metal content is of great interest in the field, since MPs are prone to either leaching (in)organic additives into the environment or taking up and accumulating hazardous components (e.g., heavy metals). In this work we demonstrate the capabilities of a simultaneous LIBS/LA-ICP-MS setup for the analysis of MPs. In the first part, we demonstrate the potential of targeted LIBS analysis for the imaging of fluor-containing polymers. Using a laser spot size of 5 mu m combined with highly sensitive ICCD detection enables analysis of particles in the low mu m range. In the second part we combine the polymer-identification capabilities of LIBS with the high sensitivity of ICP-MS to perform matrix-matched quantification of the metal content of individual MPs. In this case we use a spot size of 50 mu m facilitating polymer classification with a broadband spectrometer, resulting in detection limits of 0.72 mu g/g for Pb and 9.5 mu g/g for Sn simultaneously measured using ICP-MS.",,10.1016/j.talanta.2023.125500,Multiple Sclerosis;Intracranial Hypertension,NA,,capabilities of simultaneous 193 nm libslaicpms imaging for microplastics characterization

The Workshop arose from a previous workshop organized by the European Environment Agency (EEA) in 2008 and which also drew on case studies from the EEA reports on `Late Lessons from Early Warnings' (2001, 2013). These reports documented dozens of hazardous agents including many chemicals, for which risk reduction measures were delayed for decades after scientists and others had issued early and later warnings about the harm likely to be caused by those agents. Results: Workshop participants used recent case studies including Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), Extremely Low Frequency - Electrical Magnetic Fields (ELF-EMF fields), glyphosate, and Bisphenol A (BPA) to explore myriad reasons for divergent outcomes of evaluations, which has led to delayed and inadequate protection of the public's health. Strategies to overcome these barriers must, therefore, at a minimum include approaches that 1) Make better use of existing data and information, 2) Ensure timeliness, 3) Increase transparency, consistency and minimize bias in evidence evaluations, and 4) Minimize the influence of financial conflicts of interest. Conclusion: The recommendations should enhance the production of ``actionable evidence, `` that is, reliable evaluations of the scientific evidence to support timely actions to protect health and environments from exposures to hazardous agents.

TCGA database samples were collected, and the correlation between purine metabolism-related genes and ICC clinical features was analyzed using R language to obtain the differential genes including PPAT, PFAS, ATIC, and IMPDH2. High PPAT expression was associated with poor ICC prognosis. A PPAT silencing model in HCCC-9810 cells was constructed. The cell phenotype was examined by qRT-PCR, CCK-8, transwell, and flow cytometry, showing a decrease in IMPDH1 expression, colony and invasive cells numbers, and an increase in apoptosis.

The healthy FT provides the biological environment for successful fertilization and facilitates the subsequent movement of the conceptus to the endometrial cavity. However, when the FT is damaged, as with salpingitis, pyosalpinx, and hydrosalpinx, it may increase the risk of an ectopic pregnancy, a life-threatening condition. Decidualization refers to a multifactorial process by which the endometrium changes to permit blastocyst implantation. The decidualization reaction is vital for endometrial receptivity during the window of implantation. To date, no comprehensive review that collates evidence on decidualization in the human FT has been conducted. Therefore, the aim of this review is to compile the current evidence on cellular decidualization occurring in the healthy and pathological FT in women of reproductive age. A literature search was conducted using five databases and identified 746 articles, 24 of which were analyzed based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. The available evidence indicates that the FT are able to undergo decidual changes under specific circumstances; however, the exact mechanism by which this occurs is poorly understood.

Background Treatment failure is considered to be an important factor in relation to the increase in scabies incidence over the last decade. However, the regional and temporal differences, in addition to the predictors of therapy failure, are unclear.Objectives We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the prevalence of treatment failure in patients with scabies and investigation of associated factors.Methods We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 2021 for randomized and quasi-randomized trials, in addition to observational studies that enrolled children or adults diagnosed with confirmed or clinical scabies treated with permethrin, ivermectin, crotamiton, benzyl benzoate, malathion, sulfur or lindane, and measured treatment failure or factors associated with treatment failure. We performed a random effects meta-analysis for all outcomes reported by at least two studies.Results A total of 147 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. The overall prevalence of treatment failure was 15.2\% {[}95\% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-17.6; I2 = 95.3\%, moderate-certainty evidence] with regional differences between World Health Organization regions (P = 0.003) being highest in the Western Pacific region (26.9\%, 95\% CI 14.5-41.2).

This paper is the first formal meta-analysis to examine the phytotoxic effects of microplastics and their impact on soil functions in the plant-soil system. Our specific aims were to: 1) determine how the type and size of microplastics affect plant and soil health, 2) identify which agricultural plants are more sensitive to microplastics, and 3) investigate how the frequency and amount of microplastic pollution affect soil functions. Plant morphology, antioxidant production and photosynthesis ca-pacity were impacted by the composition of polymers in microplastics, and the responses could be negative, positive or neutral depending on the polymer type. Phytotoxicity testing revealed that maize (Zea mays) was more sensitive than rice (Oryza sativa) and wheat (Triticum aestivum) within the Poaceae family, while wheat and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) were less sensitive to microplastics exposure. Microplastics-impacted soils tend to be more porous and retain more water, but this did not improve soil stability or increase soil microbial diversity, sug-gesting that microplastics occupied physical space but were not integrated into the soil biophysical matrix.

Because of the excellent thermal stability, high surface activity, lipophobicity and hydrophobicity, they are widely used in different fields such as non-stick coatings, dental floss, and aqueous film-forming foams. PFASs inevitably enter the environments by industrial and domestic emissions, and exist stably in the environment. In recent years, PFASs pollution becomes a global environmental problem. Microorganisms are an indispensable part of the ecosystems, acting as an important participant in the material cycle and energy flow. Both microbial surfaces and PFASs are relatively hydrophobic, and hydrophobic interaction facilitates PFASs to contact microorganisms, which further inhibit their activity. In turn, microorganisms could affect the transformation and fate of PFASs. Therefore, it is of importance to systematically summarize the interaction between PFASs and microorganisms in order to provide critical information for better understanding the environmental risks of PFASs. This review systematically expounded the interaction between PFASs and environmental microorganisms. Firstly, the cytotoxicity of PFASs to bacteria was highlighted. It was found that PFASs could promote the synthesis and release of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS), and affect the composition and structure of EPS, thereby inhibiting the activity of extracellular enzymes or destroying the integrity of biofilm. In addition, hydrophobic interaction promoted the penetration of PFASs to the phospholipid bilayer, increasing the fluidity and permeability of the membrane. Furthermore, the increase of membrane permeability caused bacterial metabolism disorder, which resulted in the excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Excessive ROS could oxidize unsaturated fatty acids to malondialdehyde (MDA), and induce crosslinking of nucleic acids and lead to DNA damage. Secondly, this review elucidated the impact of PFASs on the microbial communities in the environments. In the soil and freshwater environments, the changes of bacterial abundance are mainly regulated by PFASs concentrations. It is worth noting that PFASs at high concentration (>10 mg/kg) reduced the abundance of bacteria related to soil nitrogen transformation and phosphorus metabolism, thus posing a potential threat to the cycling capacities of soil nitrogen and phosphorus. Additionally, sulfur cycle and nitrification process in freshwater environment are inhibited by high-concentration PFASs (>10 mg/L). In terms of the marine environment, the impact of PFASs on microbial communities was much lower than that of environmental parameters (e.g., nutrient substances and salinity). Finally, the microbial transformation pathway of PFASs was discussed. The biofilm formed by microorganisms and their extracellular secretions could adsorb and transform/degrade PFASs by different reactions (e.g., Feammox, desulfurization and hydrolysis), mediating by extracellular enzymes (e.g., C-SO3- bond lyase, phosphatase and polyurethane enzyme), thus affecting the toxicity and fate of PFASs. Moreover, the challenges and future perspectives were addressed. PFASs in the biofilm could be transferred to the organisms at higher trophic level through the parasitic or predatory food chains. Therefore, the risk of PFASs along the microbe-based food chain should be further investigated. In addition, microorganisms existed in the environments usually in the form of community. Current research on the molecular mechanisms of PFASs on microbial quorum sensing is relatively lacking, and deserves an in-depth investigation. Finally, due to the lack of some metabolite standards and instrument detection limit, there are still unidentified transformation products in the biotransformation pathways of PFASs. The issues highlighted above are suggested to be focused on the further investigations.",,10.1360/TB-2022-0948,,NA,,interaction between per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and microorganisms

Studies have reported the toxicity of combined pollutants on the performance and mi-crobial community in sequencing batch reactors. However, the influence of combined pollutants on nitrogen removal in wetlands remains unclear. Here, an 84 d exposure experiment was conducted to investigate the effects of cadmium (Cd) and doxycycline (DC) on nitrogen metabolism in ecological ditches using metagenomic anal-ysis. The results showed that adding 50 mg L-1 DC at 5 mg L-1 Cd stress deteriorated nitrogen removal per-formance and significantly increased N2O emissions and lactate dehydrogenase release. However, a low level of Cd (0.5 mg L-1) significantly reduced N2O emissions under the high DC concentration pressure (50 mg L-1). The increasing Cd concentration markedly weakened the inhibition of DC (1 mg L-1) on the relative abundances of the dominant genera. Moreover, high concentrations of mixed Cd/DC showed stronger inhibitory effects on glucokinase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and pyruvate kinase. NADH had a higher tolerance to mixed Cd/DC than ATP. However, low levels of mixed Cd/DC led to a higher abundance of key denitrifying enzymes and genes. The assimilatory nitrate reduction pathway increased under the mixture of Cd/DC stress, accompanied by an increase in ferredoxin-nitrite/nitrate reductase and the abundance of nasA and nirA genes. Our results indicate that the presence of low-level Cd could alleviate the impact of DC on nitrogen removal and N2O emissions in ecological ditches by altering microbial community and enzymatic activity associated with transport, metabolism, and gene expression. However, the increasing Cd concentration at DC stress could intensify the combined toxicity.

Pollution from heavy metal namely, arsenic, cadmium, nickel, mercury, chromium, zinc, lead etc. is becoming a major health risk. Many diseases like gastrointestinal and kidney dysfunction, nervous system disorders, skin lesions, vascular damage, immune system dysfunction, birth defects, and cancer are associated with heavy metal poisoning. Adsorption-based methods are highly popular and advantageous because of their low cost, high retention time, and good recyclability. Carbon dots are emerging as green adsorbents of recent times for various categories of water contaminants including heavy metals. The use of bio sources as a green precursor to carbon dot synthesis is opening a huge opportunity to fabricate inexpensive materials for heavy metal remediation in the future. With very high surface functionalities and large speific surface area, the adsorption of heavy metals as high as 2000 mg g-1 is achievable.

Meta-analysis results showed that exposure to PAEs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.07 (1.00, 1.14)], PFASs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.10 (1.01, 1.19)], as well as PCBs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.18 (1.02, 1.36)] and PBDEs {[}OR (95\%CI) = 1.33 (1.17, 1.50)] significantly increased the risk of GDM, but no significant effects were found for phenols, OCPs, and parabens. In addition, experimental studies suggested that the potential biological mechanisms of environmental pollutants contributing to GDM may involve insulin resistance, beta-cell dysfunction, neurohormonal dysfunction, inflammation, oxidative stress, epigenetic modification, and alterations in gut microbiome. In conclusion, long-term environmental pollutants exposure may induce the development of GDM, and there may be a synergistic effect between the homologs. However, studies conducted on the direct biological link between environmental pollutants and GDM were few. More prospective studies and high-quality in vivo and in vitro experiments were needed to investigate the specific ef-fects and mechanisms.",,10.1016/j.chemosphere.2023.138866,"Pregnancy;Diabetes, Gestational",NA,,environmental pollutants exposure and gestational diabetes mellitus evidence from epidemiological and experimental studies
rayyan-1259295165,Recent advances and issues in the application of activated carbon for water treatment in Africa: A systematic review (2007-2022),2023,12,NA,APPLIED SURFACE SCIENCE ADVANCES,2666-5239,18,NA,,"Njewa, Joel B. and Shikuku, Victor O.",,,,,"Access to clean water remains a challenge in many parts of Africa. This is compounded by the increasing pollution levels with increasing population and industrialization. Activated carbon remains the most widely used adsorbent for the removal of chemical pollutants in both drinking water and wastewater treatment processes due to its unique chemical properties and a plethora of precursor materials for development. However, to date, no available literature has systematically summarized the advances in Africa on the adsorptive removal of contaminants using activated carbons and research issues such as data acquisition and presentation, analysis approaches, citations, inconsistencies and adsorption experimental setups remain largely undocumented. In this paper, adsorption studies from Africa focusing on activated carbons for the removal of various contaminants are reviewed, from 2007 to 2022. The study focused on a literature-based approach by searching key terms in selected databases. The adsorption data were mostly best described by the Langmuir and pseudo-second-order models for dyes, anions, metal ions pesticides, and pharmaceutical compounds. According to the pooled data, the highest adsorption capacity was 1552.5 mg g-1 for PFOS adsorbed onto H3PO4-activated maize tassel-based carbon. The majority of the studies relied on linearized adsorption isotherm and kinetic models with coefficient of determination (R2) as the sole criterion for determining best-fitting models. Additionally, the majority of the studies are batch mode and laboratory-scale studies with no desorption and recyclability evaluations. Researchers should be careful to present accurate equations and units of parameters with proper citations. Pilot -scale and life cycle assessment (LCA) of the reported new materials represent an aspect largely unexplored. The fact that studies from most African countries, dating beyond 2007, could be obtained implies that activated carbons present an accessible and possibly sustainable technology for emerging economies.",,10.1016/j.apsadv.2023.100501,,NA,,recent advances and issues in the application of activated carbon for water treatment in africa a systematic review 20072022

A. and Al-Nafaei, Wedyan Saud and Alshayiqi, Alanoud Abdullah and Alanazi, Hamdah S. S. and Hasan, Imran",,,,,"In the present study, pristine ZnWO4, CoWO4, and mixed metal Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 were synthesized through the hydrothermal process using a Teflon-lined autoclave at 180 celcius. The synthesized nanomaterials were characterized by various spectroscopic techniques, such as TEM, FTIR, UV-vis, XRD, and SEM-EDX-mapping to confirm the formation of nanocomposite material. The synthesized materials were explored as photocatalysts for the degradation of xylenol orange (XO) under a visible light source and a comparative study was explored to check the efficiency of the bimetallic co-doped nanocomposite to the pristine metal tungstate NPs. XRD analysis proved that reinforcement of Co2+ in ZnWO4 lattice results in a reduction in interplanar distance from 0.203 nm to 0.185 nm, which is reflected in its crystallite size, which reduced from 32 nm to 24 nm. Contraction in crystallite size reflects on the optical properties as the energy bandgap of ZnWO4 reduced from 3.49 eV to 3.33 eV in Zn0.5Co0.5WO4, which is due to the formation of a Z-scheme for charge transfer and enhancement in photocatalytic efficiency. The experimental results suggested that ZnWO4, CoWO4, and Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 NPs achieved a photocatalytic efficiency of 97.89\%, 98.10\%, and 98.77\% towards XO in 120 min of visible solar light irradiation. The kinetics of photodegradation was best explained by pseudo-first-order kinetics and the values of apparent rate const (k(app)) also supported the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency of mixed metal Zn0.5Co0.5WO4 NPs towards XO degradation.",,10.3390/catal13020404,,NA,,hydrothermal synthesis of bimetallic zn co codoped tungstate nanocomposite with direct zscheme for enhanced photodegradation of xylenol orange

Insulin infusion sets interface with the skin surface, the dermis, and the subcutaneous space and may be the cause of infusion failure due to biological events or mechanical problems. Novel IISs with extended wear time and anti-inflammatory properties to mitigate these issues are described in the literature although material-tissue interactions are poorly understood. This rapid review focuses on the impact of IIS materials and designs on the subcutaneous response in people with diabetes and includes literature identified in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases. Twenty-one studies were identified for qualitative synthesis that encompassed a limited and heterogenic body of evidence including 10 clinical reports, six reviews, one case report, two abstracts, and two communications. Two clinical reports were randomized crossover studies. Reports on materials mostly compared steel versus polytetrafluoroethylene (Teflon) cannulas and suggested no substantial difference in tissue response to these materials. Reports on designs focused mostly on the angle of cannula insertion. To drive and improve research on extended wear and nonimmunogenic IISs, future studies should focus on material-tissue interaction as dedicated outcome measures, quantified with punch biopsy and imaging techniques such as ultrasound, optical coherence tomography, and confocal reflectance microscopy. Original studies are required to further a field too young for a systematic meta-analysis.",,10.1177/19322968221138076,,NA,,impact of infusion set materials and designs on the subcutaneous response in people with diabetes a rapid review of the literature

In recent years, treatment by means of vessel transposition has become more frequent, as in singular cases of recurrence, nerval reactions towards interposed material have been noted. In this review we research the classic microvascular decom-pression (MVD) techniques (interposition) as well as the more recent transposition and their effectiveness, considering patient outcomes as well as complications and recurrences.EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We searched online databases MEDLINE and LIVIVO, using key words trigeminal neuralgia AND transposition/ AND sling/ AND non compressive technique/ AND microvascular decompression.EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: We included 8 studies for transposition and 20 studies for the interposition, combining for 2045 patients (302 for transposition and 1743 for interposition). 96.1\% of patients in the transposition and 93.1\% in the interposition group reported a positive outcome immediately postoperatively. At follow-up, 87.4\% in the transposition group (follow-up 51.2 months) and 87.9\% of patients in the interposition group (follow-up 36.5 months), reported a positive outcome. 16.2\% of patients in the transposition and 13.1\% in the interposition group had postoperative complications. Recurrence was reported in 5.6\% of patients treated with transposition and 2.3\% of patients treated with interposi-tion. CONCLUSIONS: Transposition presents similar results concerning short-and long-term patient satisfaction for treatment of TGN as well as similar numbers of complications of recurrences as interposition. Yet, current evidence is restricted to a few retrospective studies, thus, evidence is limited so far.",,10.23736/S0390-5616.22.05514-X,Trigeminal Neuralgia;Neuralgia,NA,,contactfree transposition and interposition techniques for trigeminal neuralgia a systematic review
