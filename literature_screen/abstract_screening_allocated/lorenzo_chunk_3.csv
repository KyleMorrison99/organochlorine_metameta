We analyzed data on 41 such patients to evaluate predictors of outcome. Between January, 2010 and December 2020, among 1028 patients with EOC treated at our institute 41 (3.98%) developed CNS metastasis. Median age of patients was 48 years, ranging from 22 to 75 years. Primary outcome measure was progression free survival (PFS). Overall survival (OS), and analysis of prognostic factors were secondary outcome measures. An intention to treat analysis was done. We also performed review the literature (n=2253) as regards to clinicopathological and radiological features, treatment received, survival outcomes and prognostic factors. Median time from diagnosis of EOC to CNS metastasis was 27 months (range: 0 to 101 months). 33(80.5%) patients had FIGO stage III-IV at baseline and serous carcinoma (75.6%) was common pathology subtype. Thirteen (31.7%) patients had isolated CNS metastasis and 28 (68.3%) had intra-abdominal disease in addition. Nineteen (46.3%) patients achieved complete response post treatment with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Median PFS and OS from the time of CNS metastasis is 12 (range:1 to 51) months and 33 (range: 1 to 71) months, respectively. Absence of extracranial disease and lower serum CA-125 at diagnosis of CNS metastasis were predictive of superior PFS and OS on multivariate analysis. CNS metastasis is a late event in EOC, post multiple lines of treatment. Patients with disease limited to brain and treated with surgical resection and chemoradiation have best outcome. © 2022 The Author(s)","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: L.

To fill this gap, we investigated the variation of trichloroethylene (TCE) biodehalogenation activity in response to indigenous microbial community succession in EK-Bio by both column and batch experiments. For a 195 day EK-Bio column (∼1 V/cm, electrolyte circulation, lactate addition), biodehalogenation activity occurred first near the cathode (<60 days) and then spread to the anode (>90 days), which was controlled by electron acceptor (i.e., Fe(III)) competition and microbe succession. Amplicon sequencing and metagenome analysis revealed that iron-reducing bacteria (Geobacter, Anaeromyxobacter, Geothrix) were enriched within initial 60 d and were gradually replaced by organohalide-respiring bacteria (versatile Geobacter and obligate Dehalobacter) afterward. Iron-reducing bacteria required an initial long time to consume the competitive electron acceptors so that an appropriate reductive condition could be developed for the enrichment of organohalide-respiring bacteria and the enhancement of TCE biodehalogenation activity. © 2023 American Chemical Society.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: S.

Across 66 studies, 108 pesticides were assessed on ten human-derived cell types at four endpoints. In vitro IC50s were compared to in vivo guidelines, NOEL/NOAELs, and ADIs using Spearman correlation and linear regression models. While human neuroblastoma cells (SH-SY5Y) were the most sensitive, HepG2 was the most used cell line in evaluating the toxicity of pesticides. Amongst the ten human cell lines, the IC50s derived from SH-SY5Y cells, using MTT-24 & 48 h (the most used assay) correlated (rho = 0.56–0.79; p < 0.05) with ADIs and NOEL/NOAELs.

Soil physical and chemical properties can indicate soil quality because they affect soil microbial activity. This study used an exploratory observational method to analyze the diversity and abundance of microbes in the soil microbiome of pesticide paddy fields (PPF) and non-pesticide paddy fields (PF). The PPF samples were taken from Purwosari Village, Mijen Subdistrict, Semarang City, while the PF samples were taken from Tambangan Village, Mijen Subdistrict, Semarang City. Soil samples were taken for chemical and metagenomic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene marker region V3-V4. The results showed that microbial PPF diversity was higher than PF's based on the Shannon and Simpson index. The PPF microbiome is dominated by 3 bacterial phyla, namely Proteobacteria (26.61%), Actinobacteriota (15.13%) and Acidobacteriota (11.44%). Meanwhile, the PF microbiome was dominated by Proteobacteria (28.73%), Acidobacteriota (12.80%), and Chloroflexi (11.41%). The Archaea phylum that dominates PPF are Halobacterota (62.78%), Euryarchaeota (20.82%), and Crenarchaeota (10.89%), while in PF it is dominated by Halobacterota (80.43%), Crenarchaeota (11.03%) and Euryarchaeota (5.04%). The phylum that plays an important role in the biodegradation of organochlorine pesticides is Actinobacteria, which dominates in PPF; low abundance of Nitrospirota in PPF as a bioindicator of organochlorine pesticide contamination. © 2023, Society for Indonesian Biodiversity.

Anaerobic DCM-dechlorinating bacteria use the Wood–Ljungdahl pathway, yet dechlorination reaction mechanisms remain unclear and the enzyme(s) responsible for carbon-chlorine bond cleavage have not been definitively identified. Of the three bacterial taxa known to carry out anaerobic dechlorination of DCM, ‘Candidatus Formimonas warabiya’ strain DCMF is the only organism that can also ferment non-chlorinated substrates, including quaternary amines (i.e., choline and glycine betaine) and methanol. Strain DCMF is present within enrichment culture DFE, which was derived from an organochlorine-contaminated aquifer. We utilized the metabolic versatility of strain DCMF to carry out comparative metaproteomics of cultures grown with DCM or glycine betaine. This revealed differential abundance of numerous proteins, including a methyltransferase gene cluster (the mec cassette) that was significantly more abundant during DCM degradation, as well as highly conserved amongst anaerobic DCM-degrading bacteria. This lends strong support to its involvement in DCM dechlorination. A putative glycine betaine methyltransferase was also discovered, adding to the limited knowledge about the fate of this widespread osmolyte in anoxic subsurface environments. Furthermore, the metagenome of enrichment culture DFE was assembled, resulting in five high quality and two low quality draft metagenome-assembled genomes. Metaproteogenomic analysis did not reveal any genes or proteins for utilization of DCM or glycine betaine in the cohabiting bacteria, supporting the previously held idea that they persist via necromass utilization.

The use of animal models can help us to understand the role of specific genes and environmental stimuli-induced epigenetic modifications in the pathogenesis of ADHD and its comorbidities. The aim of this review is to provide an overview on the functional work performed in rodents, zebrafish and fruit fly and highlight the generated insights into the biology of ADHD, with a special focus on genetics and epigenetics. We also describe the behavioral tests that are available to study ADHD-relevant phenotypes and comorbid traits in these models.

In the present study, a sensitive and rapid high-performance thin-layer chromatography method was developed for the simultaneous determination of marmelosin, umbelliferone, and psoralen from the four different aerial parts of A. marmelos. The method uses HPTLC silica gel 60 RP-18 W plates as stationary phase, and acetonitrile: 0.1% orthophosphoric acid in water (1:1 v/v) as solvent system. The developed method is validated for specificity, precision, repeatability, and accuracy in accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. Further, the estimation of heavy metal suggested that the A. marmelos bark sample was highly contaminated with cadmium (3.8 ± 0.7 µg/g) which was far from the permissible range as described by World Health Organization (WHO). The observed chromium concentration was higher in the bark and the fruit than the normal range recorded in the plants. Arsenic and lead content was within the permissible range, while mercury was not detected in any of the tested samples. Studied samples were further tested for the presence of organochlorine and pyrethroid pesticides, as well as organophosphate and carbamates. Results suggested that gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (γ-HCH) was more prominent and detected in the bark and the young twig samples. Carbamates were not detected in any of the samples. Aflatoxins were absent from all the samples analyzed through ultra-performance liquid chromatography - fluorescence (UPLC-FLR) analysis.

This study aimed to analyze the literature concerning the immunohistological and ultrastructural features of DFs. It also related these features to the histogenesis of these lesions. Methods: This study included a PubMed literature search for studies addressing the clinicopathological, ultrastructural, and immunohistochemical features of DFs. It also presented some current cases of CD34-negative DFs and a subset of these lesions with aberrant expression of this protein. Results: Analysis of the PubMed literature revealed that DFs with an aberrant expression of CD34 are rare tumors that commonly affect the extremities of adult females. Separating these tumors from dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP, CD34-positive tumors) requires using a large panel of immunostains. Ultrastructurally, DFs are composed of diverse cell types, including cells with histiocytic, myofibroblastic, and fibroblastic features. An analysis of the DFs described by this study revealed that cases with an aberrant expression of CD34 protein had slightly high mean age and male sex predominance when compared to CD34-negative cases. The former commonly affected the extremities. There was no evidence of local recurrence or distant metastasis on follow-up. Conclusions: DFs have the potential to express CD34 protein, defining a rare aberrant phenotype, which was not associated with any differences in the outcome as compared to CD34-negative DFs. © 2023 by the authors.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: M.R.A.

Zeno 35/39, Pisa, 56127, Italy","Background and Objective: Marine environments can be contaminated by various anthropogenic persistent organic pollutants, such as petroleum-related (e.g., polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs), industrial (e.g., polychlorinated biphenyl, PCBs), and agriculture-related (e.g., organochlorine pesticides, OCPs) chemicals. Moreover, microplastic (MPs, particles < 5 mm) pollution of seawater is increasing in recent years and they can behave as a vehicle of chemicals acquired from the surrounding environment. Such MPs role is relevant from a public health perspective, increasing the exposure of beachgoers to harmful chemicals. In this paper, 40 field studies of MPs-sorbed organic pollutants were reviewed with the aim to understand the level of chemical contamination of MPs in the marine compartments. Methods: The literature search was conducted following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. The keywords included microplastic in combination with the organic contaminants that could be adsorbed by MPs. Results: The methodology used for MPs-sorbed chemicals detection showed great differences among the studies, from sampling to analytical techniques. The most frequently searched chemicals were PCBs (55% of the reviewed papers) followed by PAHs (47.5%), and OCPs (42.5%). When such chemicals were searched, they were detected in almost one of the sampling sites included in each study. Overall, PCBs level showed a median concentration of 290 ng/g. The median PAH concentration was 3,595 ng/g, with an extremely high amount of 120,000 ng/g found in MPs from Chinese seawater. Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane was the most frequently detected OCP, with a median of 126.9 ng/g. Conclusion: This paper revealed that MPs can accumulate high level of chemicals in the marine environment, thus increasing the human exposure during swimming or rest on the beach. Despite the public health relevance of such human exposure, this topic is still little explored as demonstrated by the lack of standardized method for MPs collection and chemical analysis. © (2023), (European Publishing).

In this review article, we summarize the current literature on these roles before discussing the function of FPRs in the pathogenesis of musculoskeletal disorders including osteoarthritis (OA), degenerative disc disease (DDD), and rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Additionally, we discuss the potential diagnostic and therapeutic roles of FPRs in these domains. Methods: PubMed and Ovid MEDLINE searches were performed from 1965 through March 2022. Keywords included “FPR, tissue expression, inflammation, infection, musculoskeletal disorder, bone, rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis, degenerative disc disease, mitochondria.” Results: Sixty-nine studies were included in this review article. FPRs appear to be ubiquitous in the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and treatment of common musculoskeletal disorders. They can potentially be utilized for the earlier diagnosis of OA and DDD. They may be employed with mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to reverse OA and DDD pathologies. With anti-inflammatory, anti-osteolytic, and pro-angiogenic functions, they may broaden treatment options in RA. Conclusions: FPRs appear to be heavily involved in the pathogenesis of common musculoskeletal conditions, including arthritis, degenerative disc disease, and rheumatoid arthritis. Furthermore, they demonstrate much promise in the diagnosis and treatment of these conditions. Their roles should continue to be explored. © 2022 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: X.

The efficacy of Moringa oleifera biosorbent has been investigated in diverse research work using various techniques, including its adsorption capacity kinetic, thermodynamic evaluation, adsorbent modifications, and mechanism behind the adsorption process. The Langmuir isotherm provided the most remarkable experimental data fit for batch adsorption investigations, whereas the best fit was obtained with the pseudo-second order kinetic model. Furthermore, only a few papers that combined batch adsorption with fixed-bed column investigations were examined. In the latter articles, the scientists modified the adsorbent to increase the material’s adsorption capacity as determined by analytical methods, including IR spectroscopy, scanning electronic microscope (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). However, the raw material can show appreciable adsorption capacity values, proving moringa’s potency as a biosorbent. Hydrogen bonds, electrostatic interaction, and van der Waals forces were the main processes in the found and reported adsorbent-adsorbate interactions. These mechanisms could change depending on the physiochemical nature of adsorption. Although frequently employed for heavy metal ions and dye adsorption, Moringa oleifera can still be explored in pesticide and medication adsorption investigations due to the few publications in this comprehensive review.

Some of the metals can have an adverse impact on the aquatic environment, even present in a lower concentration. The present study investigates the concentration of the selected heavy metals (Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As, and T-Hg) in Faunus ater (Mollusca, Gastropoda) that was collected from the rivers surrounding Universiti Malaysia Terengganu area. At each station, 25 individuals were collected. A total of 100 individuals of F. ater were collected at four different stations. The Teflon bomb digestion method was used to digest the samples after mixing them with 1.5 mL of suprapur nitric acid. Heavy metal concentration is analyzed using Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS), model Perkin Elmer Elan 9000, and the pollution status is evaluated by Pollution Load Index (PLI). The concentration of heavy metal is varied within the stations. The average concentration of Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, As, and T-Hg in F. ater was 29.7±1.29 μg/g dry wt., 42.1±7.77 μg/g dry wt., 0.26±0.04 μg/g dry wt., 0.58±0.08 μg/g dry wt., 2.17±021 μg/g dry wt. and 0.19±0.04 μg/g dry wt., respectively. One-way ANOVA test shows that for metal Cu, Zn, Pb, and As, there is no statistically significant difference in all stations (p > 0.05). A positive correlation of Cd, Cu, Zn, and Pb is observed with the size of F. ater, suggesting that the bioaccumulation process occurs in the F. ater. For metal and metal correlation, only Zn-Cd shows a moderate correlation compared to other metals and indicates that metals from the study area come from different sources of pollutants. The PLI value in the study area was recorded below 50, which indicated no detailed survey is needed.

Here, glucose turnover is of special interest, as proinflammatory immune cells mainly utilize glycolysis to meet their energy needs. Noninvasive approaches to monitor both processes would help elucidate this interwoven relationship to identify new therapeutic targets and diagnostic opportunities. Methods: For induction of defined inflammatory hotspots, LPS-doped Matrigel plugs were implanted into the neck of C57BL/6J mice. Subsequently, 1H/19F magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was used to track the recruitment of 19F-loaded immune cells to the inflammatory focus and deuterium (2H) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) was used to monitor the metabolic fate of [6,6-2H2]glucose within the affected tissue. Histology and flow cytometry were used to validate the in vivo data. Results: After plug implantation and intravenous administration of the 19F-containing contrast agent, 1H/19F MRI confirmed the infiltration of 19F-labeled immune cells into LPS-doped plugs while no 19F signal was observed in PBS-containing control plugs. Identification of the inflammatory focus was followed by i.p. bolus injection of deuterated glucose and continuous 2H MRS. Inflammation-induced alterations in metabolic fluxes could be tracked with an excellent temporal resolution of 2 min up to approximately 60 min after injection and demonstrated a more anaerobic glucose utilization in the initial phase of immune cell recruitment. Conclusion: 1H/2H/19F MRI/MRS was successfully employed for noninvasive monitoring of metabolic alterations in an inflammatory environment, paving the way for simultaneous in vivo registration of immunometabolic data in basic research and patients.

In addition, it is suspected of having carcinogenic properties. BPA is used in the manufacture of several everyday products and, as a result, its discharge into the environment is expected. Thus, it is found in surface water, groundwater, and seawater at concentrations ranging from 5 to 200ng/L, which are potentially harmful to humans and wildlife. Therefore, the removal of BPA from industrial wastewater to avoid BPA environmental pollution is a matter of serious worldwide concern. The conventional wastewater treatment processes are costly and inefficient for the removal of BPA. This has driven the search for alternative methods such as those based on oxidative enzymes. In this context, laccases are attracting increasing interest in the last decades due to their broad substrate specificity and the fact that they only need molecular oxygen to exert their catalytic action producing water as the only by-product. This approach is believed to be a promising technology since it is cost-effective, environmentally friendly, and does not produce sludge. Detailed characterization of the intermediates and metabolites produced during enzymatic degradation of BPA as well as toxicity studies are of great importance to assess the effectiveness of the biodegradation process.

Although they are considered as reactive proliferations, their exact pathophysiology remains unknown and, therefore, they lack a specific treatment. Aims: The aim of this study is to review the evidence on cases of histiocytosis treated with UVB and/or UVA and to report a new case of relapsing group C histiocytosis that has been successfully treated with PUVA therapy. Materials & Methods: We have conducted a review of the literature published over the last 40 years on the treatment of histiocytosis with phototherapy in the online PubMed database. We also describe a new case of successful treatment of histiocytosis with PUVA therapy. Results: Our patient was a 27-year-old man with persistent outbreaks of cutaneous histiocytosis over the previous 8 years. He responded successfully to PUVA therapy, and no relapse has been detected after one year of follow-up. Discussion: Self-involution is usual in group C histiocytosis, so conservative management is usually the first approach. Relapsing cases pose a therapeutic challenge. Reported treatment options for these patients include isotretinoin, cryotherapy, immunosuppressants, low-dose chemotherapy, CO2 laser, radiotherapy, and surgery. Phototherapy and photochemotherapy have been used in a small number of patients with considerable success. The main limitation to provide firm recommendations on histiocytosis therapy is the absence of solid evidence, as the articles published are mainly case reports with a short follow-up. In our patient, despite the short follow-up we have considered photochemotherapy to be effective since no spontaneous remission had been achieved in the previous 8 years.

In this research, we used this fish as a potential tool for the identification of EDCs that have a significant impact on human health. We conducted an electronic search in PubMed (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed) and Google Scholar (https://scholar.google.com/) using the search terms, Japanese medaka, Oryzias latipes, and endocrine disruptions, and sorted 205 articles consisting of 128 chemicals that showed potential effects on estrogen–androgen–thyroid–steroidogenesis (EATS) pathways of Japanese medaka. From these chemicals, 14 compounds, namely, 17β-estradiol (E2), ethinylestradiol (EE2), tamoxifen (TAM), 11-ketotestosterone (11-KT), 17β-trenbolone (TRB), flutamide (FLU), vinclozolin (VIN), triiodothyronine (T3), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), tetrabromobisphenol A (TBBPA), terephthalic acid (TPA), trifloxystrobin (TRF), ketoconazole (KTC), and prochloraz (PCZ), were selected as references and used for the identification of apical endpoints within the EATS modalities. Among these endpoints, during classification, priorities are given to sex reversal (masculinization of females and feminization of males), gonad histology (testis–ova or ovotestis), secondary sex characteristics (anal fin papillae of males), plasma and liver vitellogenin (VTG) contents in males, swim bladder inflation during larval development, hepatic vitellogenin (vtg) and choriogenin (chg) genes in the liver of males, and several genes, including estrogen–androgen–thyroid receptors in the hypothalamus–pituitary–gonad/thyroid axis (HPG/T). After reviewing 205 articles, we identified 108 (52.68%), 46 (22.43%), 19 (9.26%), 22 (17.18%), and 26 (12.68%) papers that represented studies on estrogen endocrine disruptors (EEDs), androgen endocrine disruptors (AEDs), thyroid endocrine disruptors (TEDs), and/or steroidogenesis modulators (MOS), respectively. Most importantly, among 128 EDCs, 32 (25%), 22 (17.18%), 15 (11.8%), and 14 (10.93%) chemicals were classified as EEDs, AEDs, TEDs, and MOS, respectively. We also identified 43 (33.59%) chemicals as high-priority candidates for tier 2 tests, and 13 chemicals (10.15%) show enough potential to be considered EDCs without any further tier-based studies. Although our literature search was unable to identify the EATS targets of 45 chemicals (35%) studied in 60 (29.26%) of the 205 articles, our approach has sufficient potential to further move the laboratory-based research data on Japanese medaka for applications in regulatory risk assessments in humans.

Blood and urine are traditionally used as human biomonitoring tools for internal exposure of environmental pollutants, while human hair, as an alternative matrix, has been seen as an attractive biomonitoring substrate because of the convenient and noninvasively collection, with minimal cost, and easy storage and transport for laboratory analysis. Also, hair sampling reflects fairly long-term exposure and may pinpoint the actual time of an acute exposure, as compared to routine biomonitoring tools. Owing to the advantages, an increasing number of studies have devoted to developing hair analysis in the past decades. However, concerns have still been raised regarding the appropriateness for assessing the internal dose by hair analysis so far. From two aspects of heavy metals and organic contaminants, this review summaries the research progress on analytical methodologies, exposure assessment, associations with internal/external indicators, distinction between endogenous and exogenous sources, health effects, and health-based reference values of environmental pollutants in human hair. It is indicated that cleaning is a key step in the methods of hair analysis. Pollutants in hair derived from both endogenous and exogenous contamination. Besides the incorporation in hair through the bloodstream (internal dose), pollutants may also be present in hair due to external exposure from air, dust, etc. Washing procedures for collected hair samples prior to analysis has been showed to be the most effective way to remove exogenous contamination, particularly for heavy metals. Organic solvent, surfactant, and deionized water are the most frequently used washing methods for hair analysis of organic pollutants; however, the applicability for the variety of organic pollutants is still questioned. Until now, extensive studies have reported the occurrence of environmental pollutants in human hair, but the lack of standard analytical methods makes it difficult for the information comparison. Another disadvantage is the limited evidence for the association between hair and body burden of pollutants. Although relevance between hair and environmental matrix, e.g., dust, air, and water have been indicated, inconsistent results were reported between hair and other internal indicators, e.g., blood, serum, and urine, except for arsenic (As) and selenium (Se), which have reached consensus for the correlations between hair and traditional indicators to some degree. Compared to heavy metals, relatively few studies have investigated the associations of organic pollutants between hair and endogenous tissues, which focused mainly on organohalogenated pollutants, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, and other persistent organic pollutants. Besides the varied results on the significance of correlations between hair and blood, the correlation coefficients were generally low for most of the reported organic pollutants. These observations were commonly attributed to exogenous pollution, which highlight the importance of identifying internal and external sources of contaminants. In recent years, composition patterns, chiral signatures, and specific metabolites were successfully used to distinguish between the internal and external exposure sources of organic pollutants in hair. Nevertheless, the limitations of these methods implied that the internal and external sources of hair pollutants remain a controversial issue. Many studies, as yet, have assessed the health effects of heavy metals in hair, whereas the establishment of health-based reference values, except for As and mercury (Hg), is rather difficult since confounding factors impose restrictions on the interpretation of individual results. Meanwhile, no study, as far as we know, has investigated the health effects, nor yet reference values, of novel organic pollutants in human hair. The general consensus is that some scientific issues should be resolved before human hair can be accepted as a useful tool in evaluating internal exposure to environmental pollutants. Based on the analysis, it is suggested that future scientific research on hair analysis should focus on the elucidation of transport mechanisms of pollutants into hair and associations of pollutants between hair and blood/urine. It is necessary to undertake epidemiological studies based on hair analysis of organic pollutants as well as the formulation of health-based reference values. © 2023 Chinese Academy of Sciences.

Bioaccumulation and toxicity of pesticides have raised environmental concerns, highlighting the need for effective removal techniques by using nanomaterials. The ability of hybrid nitrogen incorporated bismuth oxide with stannous oxide (N-Bi2O3@SnO2) were utilized for the removal of Ethion (ET) and Toxaphene (TP) pesticides. Leaves of A. indica (commonly found plant in India) employed as a natural surfactant and deionised water as a greener solvent. The purity and crystallinity of the deformed spherical nanoparticle (10–80 nm) were ensured by the sharp peaks acquired by PXRD. Subsequently, N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite was investigated for the elimination of pesticides at discrete reaction parameters (pollutant: 2–10 mgL−1; catalyst: 15–35 mg; pH: 3–11, dark-sunlight). N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite showed maximum degradation (ET:96 % and TP:90 %) with 30 mg catalytic dosage, at initial concentration of pesticide (2 mgL−1) at neutral pH under sunlight irradiation. Larger surface area (75 m2g−1), more negative value of zeta potential (–23.4 mV), and lower bandgap (2.1 eV) supported the effective photocatalytic efficiency of N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite. The presence of holes, O2, and OH radicals were responsible for the breakdown of the complex structure of ET and TP, confirmed by scavenger analysis. Safer metabolites formed after degradation confirmed by GC–MS analysis. Conclusively, by virtues greater efficiency of reusability (n = 8), stability, and greater charge separation, hybrid N-Bi2O3@SnO2 nanocomposite may prove as an alternative catalyst for industrial application with intense scope. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 18; Correspondence Address: M.

With the rising incidence of these injuries, they are expected to double by 2050. Incidence rates are higher in females than males and in white patients than black African patients. Osteoporosis weakens the local trochanteric anatomic support leading to an increased susceptibility to fractures. Disruption of the posteromedial calcar region results in fracture instability. Optimal lag screw position and fracture reduction are significant determinants for postoperative outcomes. The tip apex distance and reduction criteria determine lag screw cut-out risk and fracture reduction quality, respectively. A calcar-referenced tip apex distance is comparable if not better than the tip apex distance in predicting cut-out risk. Optimal reduction is in slight valgus, a positive medial cortex apposition and smooth anterior cortex apposition. High mortality rates are observed with non-surgical treatment. Surgical management is therefore the gold standard for intertrochanteric fractures. Treatment options are categorised into extramedullary fixation, intramedullary fixation and proximal femur replacement. They include the dynamic hip screw (DHS), cephalomedullary nails (CMN) and arthroplasty. Although still in use, the proximal femur locking plate is falling out of favour due to high complication rates. Fracture stability and pattern influence the treatment choice. There is, however, a growing use of CMNs which has been attributed to surgical training background. Modification of older CMN designs has improved treatment outcomes. Systematic meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) do not show superiority of one treatment option over another; therefore, there is no consensus on the best treatment choice. The proximal femur nail antirotation (PFNA) has better outcomes compared to other fixation options with respect to intraoperative blood loss and Harris hip scores. As a group, CMNs have a better 120-day postoperative quality of life compared to the DHS. No significant difference in complications has been found between treatment options. In light of the anticipated increased incidence of intertrochanteric fracture, more work is needed in planning national resource allocation, devising preventative methods and improving clinical interventions in South Africa. © 2023 Sukati FM.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: F.M.

Biomonitoring has been increasingly used to characterize exposure of firefighting forces to contaminants. However, available data are dispersed and information on the most relevant and promising biomarkers in this context of firefighting is missing. This review presents a comprehensive summary and critical appraisal of existing biomarkers of exposure including volatile organic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, several other persistent other organic pollutants as well as heavy metals and metalloids detected in biological fluids of firefighters attending different fire scenarios. Urine was the most characterized matrix, followed by blood. Firefighters exhaled breath and saliva were poorly evaluated. Overall, biological levels of compounds were predominantly increased in firefighters after participation in firefighting activities. Biomonitoring studies combining different biomarkers of exposure and of effect are currently limited but exploratory findings are of high interest. However, biomonitoring still has some unresolved major limitations since reference or recommended values are not yet established for most biomarkers. In addition, half-lives values for most of the biomarkers have thus far not been defined, which significantly hampers the design of studies.

Clinical experiences suggest alcohol co-ingestion (or withdrawal) makes patient management more difficult after self-poisoning and may contribute to poor clinical outcomes. We aimed to systematically review the world literature to explore the relationship between alcohol co-ingestion and outcome in pesticide self-poisoning. Methods: We searched 13 electronic databases and Google scholar, conducted citation searching and a review of reference lists to find studies which investigated the relationship of alcohol with clinical outcome of pesticide self-poisoning in different countries. Thirteen studies, including 11 case series/reports and two cohort studies were considered for inclusion. Results: Meta-analysis showed that alcohol co-ingestion in pesticide self-poisoning was associated with increased risk of death [odds ratio (OR) 4.9, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.9-8.2 P<0.0001] and that alcohol co-ingested group required intubation eight times more often than non-co-ingested group in organophosphorus insecticide self-poisoning (OR 8.0, 95% CI 4.9-13.0 P<0.0001). Cases who co-ingested alcohol were older than non-alcohol group in two studies. One cohort study demonstrated that alcohol co-ingestion was associated with larger pesticide ingestions but did not itself affect the outcome. Conclusions: This systematic review indicates that alcohol co-ingestion may worsen clinical outcome in pesticide self-poisoning.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Findings across studies revealed histopathological changes consistent with peroxisomal proliferation, whereas two reports of steatosis could not be confirmed in the published figures. In addition, mechanisms of hepatocellular death were assessed in H&E sections as well as with the apoptotic marker cleaved caspase-3 (CCasp3) in newly cut sections from archived liver blocks from select studies. A comparison of serially CCasp3 immunolabeled and H&E-stained sections revealed that mechanisms of hepatocellular death cannot be clearly discerned in H&E-stained liver sections alone as several examples of putatively necrotic cells were positive for CCasp3. Published whole genome transcriptomic data were also reevaluated for enrichment of various forms of hepatocellular death in response to HFPO-DA, which revealed enrichment of apoptosis and autophagy, but not ferroptosis, pyroptosis, or necroptosis.

Ubiquitous PFAS contamination of drinking water, groundwater, surface water, and sediment has been detected, especially in areas with rapid industrial and economic development. Its accumulation in living organisms and foods has accentuated the importance of investigations into aquatic organisms at the bottom of the food chain, as the stability and integrity of the food web as well as the population quantity and structure of the aquatic ecosystem may be affected.

Twenty-three papers were identified and categorized into three groups of participants: general population, mixed in/outpatient samples, and patients with specific disorders. The prevalence rates ranged from 0% to 1.9% amongst the general population, 5–20% in outpatients and 17.5–41.9% in inpatients. In studies of patients with specific disorders, prevalence rates varied: 1.8–5.9% (substance abuse), 3.3–20.2% (anxiety), 3.7–20.4% (other dissociative disorders), 16.3% (schizophrenia), 17% (borderline personality disorder), ~50% (depression). The highest rates were found in people who experienced interpersonal abuse (25–53.8%). The prevalence rate of DDD is around 1% in the general population, consistent with previous findings. DDD is more prevalent amongst adolescents and young adults as well as in patients with mental disorders.

Objective: This study provides a systematic review and meta-analysis of the impacts of OP pesticides on semen quality and male reproductive hormones. Methods: This study was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) protocols. Strategic search was conducted using combined text words as search terms. The eligibility criteria were developed based on Population, Exposure, Comparator, Outcome, and Study designs (PECOS) framework. Relevant data were extracted, risk of bias was evaluated by The Office of Health Assessment and Translation (OHAT) tool, and certainty of evidence was assessed by the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) Working Group guidelines. Quantitative meta-analysis was performed by using Review Manager. Results: A total of 766 male subjects (349 exposed to OP pesticides and 417 unexposed controls) were included in the meta-analysis. There was no significant difference in the ejaculate volume, seminal fluid volume, sperm multiple anomaly index, sperm, and leukocytes levels of the OP-exposed subjects compared to the control. In addition, OP pesticides exposure did not significantly affect serum concentrations of FSH, LH, and testosterone in subjects who were exposed to OP pesticides compared to their unexposed counterparts. However, we found a significant reduction in the sperm count, sperm concentration, progressive sperm motility, total sperm motility, and normal sperm morphology of OP pesticides-exposed subjects compared to the unexposed subjects. However, after subtype and sensitivity analyses, exposure to OP pesticides did not reduce sperm count. Also, after sensitivity analysis, OP pesticides exposure did not alter progressive sperm motility. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that OP pesticides exposure reduced sperm count, concentration, total and progressive motility, and normal sperm morphology, possibly via a testosterone-independent mechanism.

However, there is currently a lack of clinical diagnostic methods for rapid metabolite detection in EB samples and metabolomic data processing. In this project, we develop a method that uses a collecting device to efficiently collect exhaled breath samples on perfluoroethylene propylene (FEP) modified silicon nanowires (SiNWs). The sample chips are directly detected by nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS), and the mass spectrometry (MS) results are collected as a dataset and analyzed by machine learning techniques. FEP@SiNWs chips improved metabolite trapping efficiency and laser desorption/ionization efficiency during sample collection and mass spectrometry detection, enabling rapid metabolomic analysis with good stability and detection repeatability. Through machine learning technology, the MS information of metabolites in EB samples of patients with pulmonary nodules and healthy people was processed, the characteristic peaks were selected, and the prediction accuracy (>95.4 %) and sensitivity (92.6 - 98.5 %) of the machine learning model were tested. Based on this work, the collecting device and FEP@SiNWs chips have the potential to be used as home health management devices, and a metabolomic database of respiratory diseases via exhaled breath samples can be established in future research, which can be applied to respiratory disease diagnosis and intelligent healthcare.  © 2023 IEEE.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: J.

Many epidemiological studies have found that PFAS exposure is associated with hypertension risk, but others possess a different opinion. Overall, the relationship between PFASs and hypertension risk remains controversial. We sought to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to clarify the association between PFAS exposure and human risk of hypertension. We conducted a meta-analysis based on population-involving studies published from 1975 to 2023, which we collected from Web of Science, PubMed, and Embase databases. The odds ratio (OR) and standardized mean difference (SMD), with their 95% confidence interval (CI), were used to assess the risk of hypertension with PFAS exposure. The statistical heterogeneity among studies was assessed with the Q-test and I2 statistics. Research publications related to our meta-analysis topic were systematically reviewed. Fourteen studies involving 71,663 participants, in which 26,281 suffered hypertension, met the inclusion criteria. Our analyses suggest that exposure to general PFAS (OR = 1.09, 95% CI = 1.04-1.14) or PFOS (OR = 1.17, 95% CI = 1.05-1.30) is associated with hypertension risk. Specifically, elevated levels of general PFAS (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.08-0.42), PFHxS (SMD = 0.17, 95% CI = 0.07-0.27), and PFDA (SMD = 0.08, 95% CI = 0.02-0.13) are associated with a high risk of hypertension. Our meta-analysis indicates that PFAS exposure is a risk factor for hypertension, and increased hypertension risk is associated with higher PFAS levels. Further study may eventually provide a better and more comprehensive elucidation of the potential mechanism of this association. © 2023, International Heart Journal Association.

If they follow a similar course of action as other, more thoroughly investigated particulates, MNPs may penetrate epithelial barriers, potentially triggering a cascade of signaling events leading to cell damage and inflammation. Inflammasomes are intracellular multiprotein complexes and stimulus-induced sensors critical for mounting inflammatory responses upon recognition of pathogen- or damage-associated molecular patterns. Among these, the NLRP3 inflammasome is the most studied in terms of activation via particulates. However, studies delineating the ability of MNPs to affect NLRP3 inflammasome activation are still rare. In this review, we address the issue of MNPs source and fate, highlight the main concepts of inflammasome activation via particulates, and explore recent advances in using inflammasome activation for assessment of MNP immunotoxicity. We also discuss the impact of co-exposure and MNP complex chemistry in potential inflammasome activation. Development of robust biological sensors is crucial in order to maximize global efforts to effectively address and mitigate risks that MNPs pose for human health.

These fish are extensively utilized in experimental studies to simulate carcinogenic, mutagenic, and general toxic effects. The literature search was conducted using Web of Science, Scopus, PubMed, and eLIBRARY.RU databases following the PRISMA 2020 recommendations. A total of 613 articles were identified, out of which 14 were selected for detailed analysis. Among them, 11 focused on assessing the impact of PCB exposure on the reproductive system of Danio rerio. Additionally, 8 articles reported on the results of studying the effects of parental exposure to PCBs on the viability and postembryonic development of their offspring. The adverse effects of PCBs, either alone or in combination with other POPs, have been studied to a lesser extent in male Danio rerio compared to females. Furthermore, the transmission of morphological and functional disorders to subsequent generations resulting from separate parental exposure to PCBs in both sexes, as well as the dose-response relationship, have not been adequately assessed based on the published works. Moreover, developmental disorders in offspring have mostly been studied for the first generation following parental exposure to mixtures of POPs and PCBs. The lack of such information hinders a proper evaluation of the transgenerational risk inheritance phenomenon, specifically regarding the transmission of morphological and functional disorders associated with progenitor exposure to PCBs and other environmental endocrine-disrupting pollutants. The findings of this analysis can be used for planning experimental quantitative assessments, predicting, and preventing impairments to human reproductive health, and safeguarding the well-being of future generations. © Eco-Vector, 2023.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: D.A.

However, there are also local sources of pollution. Our study was focused on possible pollution in the Finnish Lapland, transferred from the Pechenganikel industrial complex located in the borders of Russia, Finland and Norway. Local food items and blood samples of pregnant women from the Inari municipality were collected and organochlorine compounds (OCs) and metal(oid)s analyzed. Most of the examined food samples showed detectable levels of these compounds. The mean concentrations of DDTs and polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) were higher in fish (0.18–0.32 ng/g and 0.34–0.64 ng/g, respectively), than in the other food groups (0.027–0.047 ng/g and 0.11–0.20 ng/g, respectively). PCBs were found at the highest concentrations in blood samples of the pregnant women, and congeners 153 and 118 were dominant. The mean concentration of PCB153, 0.29 μg/kg serum lipid, was lower than those described in many other studies. Concerning DDTs, the 4,4′-DDT/4,4′-DDE ratio, 0.092, in the blood samples was lower than that observed in the food items, 0.25–0.71, reflecting old uses of the DDT pesticide. None of the observed levels of selected potentially toxic elements in blood samples and in food items exceeded the known safe limits. Higher concentrations of PCB52 and γ-HCH were observed in the serum of pregnant women who consumed greater amounts of meat, and berries and mushrooms, respectively. The OC concentrations from the pregnant women currently studied were lower than those observed fourteen years ago with pregnant women from the same municipality. Compounds whose occurrence is likely related to a long-distance transport showed clear decreases, e.g., 63% for PCBs, and for those from pesticides, decreases were 93% and 97% for 4,4′-DDE and β-HCH, respectively. No obvious influence from the Pechenganikel complex is observed from the results. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 2; Correspondence Address: K.

However, a growing body of literature has recognized that endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may play an important role in this global trend, but the association has not yet been fully established. OBJECTIVE AND RATIONALE: EDCs can interfere with normal hormone function and metabolism and play a role in pubertal onset. We aimed to systematically identify and evaluate the current evidence on the timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys following prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs. SEARCH METHODS: Following PRISMA guidelines, we performed a systematic literature search of original peer-reviewed publications in the PubMed database through a block search approach using a combination of index MeSH and free text search terms. Publications were considered if they covered biomarkers of prenatal or postnatal exposures to xenobiotic EDCs (European Commission's list of category 1 EDCs) measured in maternal or child biospecimen and pubertal onset defined by the progression of the following milestones (and assessed in terms of the following measures): menarche (age), thelarche (Tanner staging) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in girls, and genital stage (Tanner staging), testicular volume (ml) and pubarche (Tanner staging), in boys. OUTCOMES: The literature search resulted in 703 references, of which we identified 52 publications fulfilling the eligibility criteria for the qualitative trend synthesis and 23 publications for the meta-analysis. The qualitative trend synthesis provided data on 103 combinations of associations between prenatal or postnatal exposure to EDC compounds groups and puberty outcomes and the meta-analysis enabled 18 summary risk estimates of meta-associations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS: Statistically significant associations in the qualitative trend synthesis suggested that postnatal exposure to phthalates may be associated with earlier thelarche and later pubarche. However, we did not find consistent evidence in the meta-analysis for associations between timing of pubertal onset in girls and boys and exposures to any of the studied xenobiotic EDCs. We were not able to identify specific pre- or postnatal windows of exposure as particularly critical and susceptible for effects of EDCs. Current evidence is subject to several methodological challenges and inconsistencies and evidence on specific exposure-outcome associations remains too scarce to firmly confirm EDC exposure as a risk factor for changes in age of pubertal onset in the general child population. To create a more uniform foundation for future comparison of evidence and to strengthen pooled studies, we recommend the use of more standardized approaches in the choice of statistical analyses, with exposure transformations, and in the definitions and assessments of puberty outcomes. The impact of mixtures of EDC exposures on the association also remains unestablished and would be valuable to elucidate for prenatal and postnatal windows of exposure. Future large, longitudinal epidemiological studies are needed to clarify the overall association.  © 2022 The Author(s).

Single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis revealed that the three products, namely {[Cu(phen)(L2)] ⋅ 1.25H2O} (1) (teal acicula, KPI = 60.6%), {[Cu(phen)(L2)]⋅ H2O⋅DMF}n(2) (sapphire blue plate, KPI = 65.6%) and {[Cu(phen)(L2)]⋅0.31H2O}n (3) (cool grey plate, KPI = 66.8%) are 1-D supramolecular Cu(II) coordination polymers. Both 1 and 2 are composed of 1-D zigzag chains with 1 contains heterochiral Cu(II) (Λ- and Δ- alternatively) centres in the same chain and 2 contains homochiral Cu(II) (Λ- or Δ-) centres in the same chain, while 3, containing homochiral Cu(II) (Λ- or Δ-) centres, has a helical structure along a axis, with a rectangular channel of a size 19.61 × 16.61 Å2. Each helical turn spans 10.74 Å, composed of two [Cu(L2)(Phen)] units. With the largest KPI (∼66.3%), the highest thermal stability, highest formation energy from DFT calculations and lowest hygroscopicity, 3 can be obtained as the only product at higher temperature (95°C) and/or higher ratio of water (DMF/water (v/v) = 20:6), which implies that it is the thermodynamic product. 2 can be obtained at mediate temperature (60 ∼ 80°C) as the only product or co-exist with other products, while 1 only appeared at low temperature (60 and 70 °C) in the solvents of DMF/water (v/v) = 20:2 or 20:3 at a very small amount. The chromotropism of the three isomers was examined using UV-Vis spectroscopic technique, and the coordination geometry of Cu(II) was examined with Hathaway's tetragonality analysis and Continuous Shape Measures Calculation using SHAPE 2.1 programme. Linear correlations between the solid-state UV-Vis absorption maxima of the three isomers against the tetragonality (T) or the distortion percentage of the coordination geometry of Cu(II) from a perfect octahedral (Doct) were observed. The three complexes were also analyzed by FT IR, TGA and DFT formation energy calculations. The thermodynamic stability and the thermal stability of the three isomer increases in order of 1 < 2 < 3, supported by the analysis of the metal-ligand coordination bonds and the intermolecular interactions, the study of chromotropism and crystal fields, the effects of solvent polarity and temperature to the formation of isomers, the close-packing theory (KPI calculations), the DFT calculations and the TGA analysis. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: R.

To compare the hepatotoxicity of H-PFMO2OSA with legacy perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), male adult mice were exposed to 0.2, 1, or 5 mg/kg/d of each chemical for 28 days. Results showed that, although H-PFMO2OSA liver and serum concentrations were lower than those of PFOS, the relative liver weight in the H-PFMO2OSA groups was significantly higher than that in the corresponding PFOS groups. In addition, the increase in alanine transaminase and aspartate aminotransferase activity was greater in the H-PFMO2OSA groups than in the PFOS groups. Reduced glutathione (GSH) content and glutathione reductase activity in the liver increased in the 1 and 5 mg/kg/d H-PFMO2OSA groups and in the 5 mg/kg/d PFOS group. Liver quantitative proteome analysis demonstrated that, similar to PFOS, H-PFMO2OSA caused lipid metabolism disorder, and most lipid metabolism-related differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were controlled by peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα). Additionally, KEGG enrichment analysis highlighted changes in the GSH metabolism pathway after PFOS and H-PFMO2OSA exposure. Then, there were eight DEPs involved in the GSH metabolism pathway that mostly were upregulated after exposure to H-PFMO2OSA but not after exposure to PFOS. In conclusion, H-PFMO2OSA induced higher levels of liver damage and more serious GSH metabolism dysregulation compared to PFOS. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

In this study, the sub-lethal toxicity effects of oxybenzone were studied at the environmentally relevant concentrations of 0.6 and 5.2 µg/L (including 0.01% DMSO as the solvent control). An integrative in vivo and in silico experimental approach was taken to study the effects of exposure on the metabolic physiology of larval zebrafish (Danio rerio) after 7 days of exposure (from 2 to 9 days post fertilization). The use of whole-organism respirometry showed a statistically significant ∼2x increase in metabolic rate for the 0.6 µg/L treatment group, with no significant differences between the solvent control versus 5.2 µg/L oxybenzone treatment level. The analysis of whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing data showed functional categories related to metabolism (metabolic enzymes) and biological regulation (genome regulation, cell signaling) to be highly dysregulated. The transcriptomics changes for metabolic enzyme genes were used to parameterize in silico stoichiometric metabolic models for each treatment group. Flux balance analysis (FBA) simulations for each metabolic model revealed glycerolipid metabolism to be highly affected under the low dose oxybenzone exposure. The further analysis of core metabolic pathways revealed elevated flux through the esterification reactions of glycerolipid metabolism, producing triglycerides. The elevated in vivo metabolic rate observed for 0.6 µg/L oxybenzone is explainable by the elevated catalytic activities of the esterification reactions. Furthermore, the disruption of glycerolipid metabolism predicted by our in silico analysis agrees with the results of non-targeted metabolomics studies performed by other authors, and which demonstrate oxybenzone exposure to cause dyslipidemia and affect glycerophospholipid metabolism. Therefore, the methods of our study provide a framework for integrated biological pathways-based toxicological analysis. © 2022 The Author(s)","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: D.

In stress periods, however, proteostasis and survival depend on the strongly conserved Clp/Hsp100 family. Currently, the targets of ATP-powered unfoldases/disaggregases ClpB and ClpX and of peptidase ClpP heptameric rings are still unclear. Trapping experiments and proteome profiling in multiple organisms triggered confusion, so we analyzed the consistency of ClpP-trap targets in bacteria. We also provide meta-analyses of protein interactions in humans, to elucidate where Clp family members are enriched. Furthermore, meta-analyses of mouse complexomics are provided. Genotype–phenotype correlations confirmed our concept. Trapping, proteome, and complexome data retrieved consistent coaccumulation of CLPXP with GFM1 and TUFM orthologs. CLPX shows broad interaction selectivity encompassing mitochondrial translation elongation, RNA granules, and nucleoids. CLPB preferentially attaches to mitochondrial RNA granules and translation initiation components; CLPP is enriched with them all and associates with release/recycling factors. Mutations in CLPP cause Perrault syndrome, with phenotypes similar to defects in mtDNA/mtRNA. Thus, we propose that CLPB and CLPXP are crucial to counteract misfolded insoluble protein assemblies that contain nucleotides.

Indeed, LC is relatively easy to couple with the soft electrospray ionization. As a consequence, many tools have been developed for the structural annotation of tandem mass spectra. However, it is sometimes difficult to do data-dependent acquisition (DDA), especially when developing new methods that stray from the classical LC-MS workflow. Objective: An old tool from petroleomics that has recently gained popularity in metabolomics, the Van Krevelen diagram, is adapted for an overview of the molecular diversity profile in lichens through high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS). Methods: A new method is benchmarked against the state-of-the-art classification tool ClassyFire using a database containing most known lichen metabolites (n ≈ 2,000). Four lichens known for their contrasted chemical composition were selected, and extractions with apolar, aprotic polar, and protic polar solvents were performed to cover a wide range of polarities. Extracts were analyzed with direct infusion electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (DI-ESI-MS) and atmospheric solids analysis probe mass spectrometry (ASAP-MS) techniques to be compared with the chemical composition described in the literature. Results: The most common lichen metabolites were efficiently classified, with more than 90% of the molecules in some classes being matched with ClassyFire. Results from this method are consistent with the various extraction protocols in the present case study. Conclusion: This approach is a rapid and efficient tool to gain structural insight regarding lichen metabolites analyzed by HRMS without relying on DDA by LC-MS/MS analysis. It may notably be of use during the development phase of novel MS-based metabolomic approaches. © 2022 The Authors.

Dioxin and Dioxin-related compounds are a set of hazardous chemicals that are ubiquitously distributed. Polychlorinated dioxins are introduced into our surroundings by both spontaneous and induced activities like combustion, incineration of waste, recycling of e-waste, and paper and pesticide manufacturing. They are chloroaromatic compounds that are found to be lethal and possess carcinogenic properties and are one of the primary examples of persistent environmental pollutants (POP). Removal of these compounds from the environment is very challenging due to their recalcitrant nature. An alternative technique is the use of microbial technology which includes the use of bacteria and fungi to detoxify the dioxins that are considered to be a more effective, economical, and environmentally sustainable alternative. Different microbial interactions were studied for their degradation potential. Polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxin and furans (PCDD/F) are found to be degraded by bacteria by adopting either aerobic or anaerobic pathways and the details regarding the diversity, distribution, bioremediation potential, metabolic pathway have been analyzed. This review provides an overview of the source of contamination, its potential toxicity assessment, and various bioremediation techniques that are employed are discussed in detail.

Design A systematic search was conducted in four databases and the grey literature. The risk of bias of the studies was analyzed with the aid of the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. A quantitative synthesis was performed through meta-analysis. The quality of the evidence was assessed for each result using the Grading of Recommendations: Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Results: Thirteen studies (seven cross-sectional, two cohort and four case-control studies) were included in the qualitative analysis and eleven were included in the meta-analyses. Meta-analyses were conducted considering general DDE (regardless of the type of defect), hypoplasia, molar incisor hypomineralization (MIH) and hypomineralized primary second molars (HPSM). Subgroups based on the type of dentition were also analyzed. Children of mothers who had GDM presented a greater likelihood of general DDE (OR = 2.72; 95% CI: 1.66–4.44), MIH (OR = 3.14; 95% CI: 1.20–8.25) and hypoplasia (OR = 2.17; 95% CI: 1.36–3.46). No association was found between HPSM and GDM (OR = 0.60; 95% CI: 0.17–2.20). An association was found between GDM and DDE in the permanent dentition. Therefore, children whose mothers had GDM were more likely to present DDE compared to those whose mothers did not have this metabolic disorder.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of this systematic evidence map (SEM) is to summarize the epidemiology evidence on approximately 150 lesser studied PFAS prioritized by the EPA for tiered toxicity testing, facilitating interpretation of those results as well as identification of priorities for risk assessment and data gaps for future research. METHODS: The Populations, Exposure, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were intentionally broad to identify studies of any health effects in humans with information on associations with exposure to the identified PFAS. Systematic review methods were used to search for literature that was screened using machine-learning software and manual review. Studies meeting the PECO criteria underwent quantitative data extraction and evaluation for risk of bias and sensitivity using the Integrated Risk Information System approach. RESULTS: 193 epidemiology studies were identified, which included information on 15 of the PFAS of interest. The most commonly studied health effect categories were metabolic (n = 37), endocrine (n = 30), cardiovascular (30), female reproductive (n = 27), developmental (n = 26), immune (n = 22), nervous (n = 21), male reproductive (n = 14), cancer (n = 12), and urinary (n = 11) effects. In study evaluation, 120 (62%) studies were con-sidered High/Medium confidence for at least one outcome. DISCUSSION: Most of the PFAS in this SEM have little to no epidemiology data available to inform evaluation of potential health effects. Although exposure to the 15 PFAS that had data was fairly low in most studies, these less-studied PFAS may be used as replacements for “legacy” PFAS, leading to potentially greater exposure. It is impractical to generate epidemiology evidence to fill the existing gaps for all potentially relevant PFAS. This SEM highlights some of the important research gaps that currently exist. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The previously isolated phenanthrene-degrading bacterial consortium (PDMC) consists of the genera Sphingobium and Pseudomonas and can degrade a wide range of PAHs. To identify the degradation mechanism of PAHs in the consortium PDMC, metagenomic binning was conducted and a Sphingomonadales assembly genome with 100% completeness was obtained. Additionally, Sphingobium sp. SHPJ-2, an efficient degrader of PAHs, was successfully isolated from the consortium PDMC. Strain SHPJ-2 has powerful degrading abilities and various degradation pathways of high-molecular-weight PAHs, including fluoranthene, pyrene, benzo[a]anthracene, and chrysene. Two ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases, five cytochrome P450s, and a pair of electron transfer chains associated with PAH degradation in strain SHPJ-2, which share 83.0%–99.0% similarity with their corresponding homologous proteins, were identified by a combination of Sphingomonadales assembly genome annotation, reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and heterologous expression. Furthermore, when coexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) with the appropriate electron transfer chain, PhnA1B1 could effectively degrade chrysene and benzo[a]anthracene, while PhnA2B2 degrade fluoranthene.

Although PBDEs are suspected endocrine disruptors, particularly targeting thyroid and reproductive hormone functions, the relationship of PBDEs with these health effects are not well established. We used the Navigation Guide methodology to conduct a systematic review of studies in populations exposed to e-waste to better understand the relationships of these persistent flame retardants with hormonal and reproductive health.

The studies suggest PBDEs may have an adverse effect on thyroid hormones, reproductive hormones, semen quality, and neonatal health. However, more research is required to establish a relationship of these effects in the e-waste-exposed population. We identified the limitations of the data available and made recommendations for future scientific work. © 2022 by the authors.

Objectives: Cervical spine endoscopic discectomy and decompression have gained popularity in the last decade. This review aimed to shed light on the current outcomes of cervical spine endoscopic procedures for degenerative disc disease (DDD) and to calculate a pooled estimate of various outcome measures. Methods: We retrieved articles published in English related to endoscopic cervical spine procedures from 3 central databases from inception until September 2020. A subgroup analysis based on the anterior versus the posterior approach was performed. Results: Thirty-one articles fulfilled the eligibility criteria and included 1,410 patients. A successful outcome was observed in 91.3% (88.6-93.4%, P = 0.000). This percentage was lower for the anterior approach (89.6% [85.8-92.5%], P = 0.000) than for the posterior approach (94.2% [90.4-96.5%], P = 0.000). A higher percentage of poor outcomes was reported for the anterior approach (5.7% [3.2-10.1%], P = 0.000 vs. 2.3% [1-5.5%], P = 0.000 for the posterior approach). The overall complication rate was 7.2% (5.2-9.8%, P = 0.000). There was a slightly higher complication rate for the anterior approach (7.9% [4.5-13.3%], P = 0.000) than for the posterior approach (6.7% [4.4-10%], P = 0.000). The revision rate was 4.2% (2.6-6.8%, P = 0.000); and 4.2% (1.8-9.7%, P = 0.000) for the anterior approach and 4.00% (2.2-7.4%, P = 0.000) for the posterior approach. Conclusions: There is a higher success rate and lower complication rate with the posterior approach than with the anterior approach.

The search was performed in Pubmed, Web of Science, EMBASE, Cochrane, Cinhal, Psycinfo, Scopus, Medline, and Science Direct. Studies evaluating any type of physiotherapy intervention for PNP (systemic or traumatic) were included. Eighty-one articles were included in this review. The most common PNP model was chronic constriction injury, and the most frequently studied biomarkers were related to neuro-immune processes. Exercise therapy and Electro-acupuncture were the 2 most frequently studied physiotherapy interventions while acupuncture and joint mobilization were less frequently examined. Most physiotherapeutic interventions modulated the expression of biomarkers related to neuropathic pain. Whereas the results seem promising; they have to be considered with caution due to the high risk of bias of included studies and high heterogeneity of the type and anatomical localization of biomarkers reported. The review protocol is registered on PROSPERO (CRD42019142878).

The toxicological data may help in understanding the mechanism of death. This systematic review aimed to analyze autopsies related to suicides by consuming poison, focusing on the correlation between substance use and the country of origin to create an alarm bell to indicate that suicide maybe attempted and prevent it. The systematic review was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines, with the primary objective of identifying autopsies conducted in cases of suicide by consuming poison in specific geographic areas. Significant differences in substances were observed between low-income and Western countries that confirm previous literature data. In rural areas and Asian countries, most suicides by consuming poison involve the use of pesticides, such as organophosphates and carbamates. In Western countries, illicit drugs and medically prescribed drugs are the leading cause of suicide by self-poisoning. Future research should shed light on the correlation between social, medical, and demographic characteristics and the autopsy findings in suicides by self-poisoning to highlight the risk factors and implement tailored prevention programs worldwide. Performing a complete autopsy on a suspected suicide by self-poisoning could be essential in supporting worldwide public health measures and policy makers.

Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of two large studies of PFOA and renal cell carcinoma (RCC, the most common type of kidney cancer); one from the National Cancer Institute (NCI) (324 cases and controls), and a second from the C8 Science Panel (103 cases and 511 controls). Serum PFOA levels were estimated a median of 8 years before diagnosis. Analyses were conducted via conditional logistic regression. Lifetime risk of kidney cancer per unit serum PFOA concentration and per unit dose were calculated. Results: The 25th, 50th and 75th percentiles of serum PFOA levels were 4.8, 7.3, and 23.9 ng/ml for the pooled analysis. The preferred model for the pooled data was a two-piece linear spline model (knot at 12.5 ng/ml serum PFOA); the log odds of RCC increased 0.1349 per 1 ng/ml increase in serum PFOA up to the knot (eg, an OR of 2.02 (1.45–2.80) from the median to the knot), and was flat thereafter. The estimated lifetime excess risk (cancer slope factor) with an exposure of 1 ng/ml was 0.0018, similar to the excess risk of 0.0026 recently reported by CalEPA based on different methods. Assuming a serum half-life of 2.3 years and a distribution volume of 170 ml/kg for PFOA, our results are equivalent to 0.0128 per ng/kg/d of PFOA intake. To limit excess lifetime kidney cancer risk to 1/1,000,000, our data suggest a limit of 0.0015 ng/L (0.0015 ppt) for PFOA in drinking water, similar to CalEPA's proposed Public Health Goal and the new US EPA Drinking Water Health Advisory. Conclusions: Our results correspond reasonably well with cancer slope factors developed by other investigators using published summary data, and suggest drinking water limits similar to new recommendations by the US EPA. © 2022 The Author(s)","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: K.

Global warming can alter also the distribution of persistent organic pollutant (POPs) both at a global scale and in the Antarctic Region, due to their physical-chemical characteristics. Effects of climate changes have been already reported on feeding behaviour and reproductive process of organisms. Another consequence for organisms includes the POP bioaccumulation. Here we review the literature reporting the linkage between recorded effects of climate changes and POP bioaccumulation in resident marine Antarctic species (fish and penguins). Notwithstanding Antarctica is a final sink for persistent contaminants due to the extreme cold climate, a general decreasing POP trend has been observed for some POPs. Their concentrations in biota are reported to be linked to ice melting and large iceberg calving; the peculiar marine Antarctic ecosystems and the pelagic-benthic coupling may also contribute to alterations in the bioaccumulation processes. These effects are similar in polar regions, although the comparison with the Arctic biota is not possible due to the lack of data in the Antarctic Region.

Peer-reviewed journal articles on nano-, micro-, meso- and macroplastics contamination of water, sediment, air, soil and biota were accessed from PubMed, Google Scholar and Science Direct. They were screened, comprehensively revised and critically appraised for inclusion, data extraction and evidence synthesis. A total of 358,974 articles were accessed from any publication date up till May 30, 2021. Only 34 articles met the inclusion criteria and critical appraisal. Only 26 of the included studies reported the distribution, levels and/or effects of microplastics (MPs) (n = 12), macroplastics (n = 12) or both (n = 2) in water, sediment, biota, food and/or land.

Macroplastics from land-based sources were mainly reported from educational institutions, residential areas and markets. Plastic sources reported were tire wear, cigarette butts, fishing ropes and gears, plastic bags, water sachets and e-wastes. Biological effects (oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reduced plant root biomass) of virgin MPs were reported in crab, African catfish and lime tree only in laboratory experiments.

Over 1400 research articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of this test. Methods: The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects—mainly from a patient-perspective. Results: A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? Conclusions: Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: T.

This systematic review aims to determine the extent of this emerging problem, both quantitatively and qualitatively, combining temporal and science mapping analyses to explore the development of the field of UV-filters in the marine environment (from 1990 to 2021), and to outline new research frontiers. The temporal trend analysis revealed an exponential growth of published studies over the last decade (70% since 2016), confirming the emerging role of this topic in environmental science. The meta-analysis determined that 4-methylbenzylidene-camphor (4-MBC) and benzophenone-3 (BP-3) are top-priority environmental pollutants due to their increasing usage and, in turn, a frequent occurrence in marine ecosystems. This meta-analysis determined the focus on these two contaminants for this review. A critical discussion of the applications, regulatory aspects, and environmental occurrences of these selected compounds was provided. The present study also focused on the most recent (2015–2021) field and laboratory studies investigating the ecotoxicological impacts of 4-MBC and BP-3 on marine invertebrates. This review highlights the need for more research efforts to fill the knowledge gaps on the realistic effects these compounds may have when considered individually, in combination, or as subsequent exposures. Overall, this review aims to establish guidelines for further studies to understand the effect of UV-filters on marine ecosystems and marine invertebrate communities. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: A.

PFAS are stable and extremely resistant to degradation, resulting in high persistence throughout the environment as well as in human blood. PFAS consist of a large family of synthetic chemicals, with over 4000 distinct varieties having been identified and around 250 currently being manufactured at globally relevant levels. Numerous epidemiological studies have linked exposure to PFAS with adverse health effects ranging from immunotoxicity, cardiometabolic disease, developmental and reproductive effects, cancer, and recently type 2 diabetes. Several studies have demonstrated associations between serum PFAS concentrations and glycemic indicators of type 2 diabetes including glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR in adolescent and adult cohorts. In addition, some studies have shown positive associations with incident type 2 diabetes and multiple PFAS. However, the link between PFAS exposure and the development of diabetes continues to be a disputed area of study, with conflicting data having been reported from various epidemiological studies. In this mini review we will summarize the current state of the literature linking PFAS to type 2 diabetes and discuss important future directions including the use of more complex mixtures-based statistical analyses.

J Patient Rep Outcomes 5 (Suppl 2):99, 2021) such as the health-related quality of life (HrQoL) of women with pelvic organ prolapse (POP) and stress urinary incontinence (SUI). The Australasian Pelvic Floor Procedure Registry (APFPR) aims to increase capacity for women to report surgical outcomes through the collection of HrQoL data (Ruseckaite et al. Qual Life Res. 2021) but currently lacks a pain-specific PROM for women with pelvic floor disorders (PFDs), particularly POP and SUI. This review aims to systematically review the existing literature and identify instruments that measure pain in women with POP and SUI for inclusion within the APFPR, which reports on complications from these conditions. Methods: We conducted a literature search on OVID MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO and EMCARE databases in addition to Google Scholar and grey literature to identify studies from inception to April 2021. Full-text studies were included if they used PROMs to measure pain in women with POP and SUI. Two authors independently screened articles, extracted data and assessed methodological quality. Results: From 2001 studies, 23 publications describing 19 different PROMs were included for analysis. Eight of these instruments were specific to the pelvic floor; four were only specific to pain and used across multiple disorders; three were generic quality of life instruments and four were other non-validated instruments such as focus group interviews. These instruments were not specific to pain in women with POP or SUI, as they did not identify all relevant domains such as the sensation, region and duration of pain, or incidents where onset of pain occurs. Conclusions: The findings of this review suggest there are no current PROMs that are suitable pain-specific instruments for women with POP or SUI. This knowledge may inform and assist in the development of a new PROM to be implemented into the APFPR. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: R.

Data for >35 PFAS were aggregated from 96 reports published from 1999 to 2021. The final data set comprises approximately 21,000 data points after removal of time-series and duplicate samples as well as non-detects. The reported concentrations range over many orders of magnitude, from ng/L to mg/L levels. Distinct differences in concentration ranges are observed between sites located within or near sources versus those that are not. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), ranging from <0.03 ng/L to ~7 mg/L, and perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), ranging from 0.01 ng/L to ~5 mg/L, were the two most reported PFAS. The highest PFAS concentration in groundwater is ~15 mg/L reported for the replacement-PFAS 6:2 fluorotelomer sulfonate (6:2 FTS). Maximum reported groundwater concentrations for PFOA and PFOS were compared to concentrations reported for soils, surface waters, marine waters, and precipitation. Soil concentrations are generally significantly higher than those reported for the other media. This accrues to soil being the primary entry point for PFAS release into the environment for many sites, as well as the generally significantly greater retention capacity of soil compared to the other media. The presence of PFAS has been reported for all media in all regions tested, including areas that are far removed from specific PFAS sources. This gives rise to the existence of a “background” concentration of PFAS that must be accounted for in both regional and site-specific risk assessments. The presence of this background is a reflection of the large-scale use of PFAS, their general recalcitrance, and the action of long-range transport processes that distribute PFAS across regional and global scales. This ubiquitous distribution has the potential to significantly impact the quality and availability of water resources in many regions. In addition, the pervasive presence of PFAS in the environment engenders concerns for impacts to ecosystem and human health. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 32; Correspondence Address: G.R.

This article provides an updated overview of ClO2-based oxidation processes used in water treatment. A systematic review of scientific information and experimental data on ClO2-based water purification procedures is presented. Concerning ClO2-based oxidation derivative problems, the pros and cons of ClO2-based combined processes are assessed and disinfection by-product (DBP) control approaches are proposed. The kinetic and mechanistic data on ClO2 reactivity towards micropollutants are discussed. ClO2 selectively reacts with electron-rich moieties (anilines, phenols, olefins, and amines) and eliminates certain inorganic ions and microorganisms with high efficiency. The formation of chlorite and chlorate during the oxidation process is a crucial concern when utilizing ClO2. Future applications include the combination of ClO2 with ferrous ions, activated carbon, ozone, UV, visible light, or persulfate processes. The combined process can reduce by-product generation while still ensuring ClO2 sterilization and disinfection.

Among the different biological matrices used for exposure assessment, hair enables to detect the largest number of chemicals, including many classes such as persistent pollutants, hydrophilic metabolites and metals. Most biomonitoring studies are however focused on a limited number of pollutants and only give a partial information on exposure. Combining several multi-residue methods, the present study aimed at assessing the exposure of a population to an extensive variety of chemicals by hair analysis. One hair sample was collected from each participant (55 children and 134 adults). Samples were analysed with three different multi-residue methods, targeting, respectively, 152 organic pollutants (pesticides, PCBs, bisphenols, PBDEs), 62 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and metabolites, nicotine and cotinine and 36 metals. From 33 to 70 organic chemicals were detected in each child’s hair sample, and from 34 up to 74 in adults. From 7 to 26 PAH were detected per child, and 7 to 21 in adults. Twenty-three to 27 metals were detected per child and 21 to 28 per adult.

The most currently used dynamic hip screw (DHS) and the proximal femoral nail (PFN) are both with pros and cons. We aimed to assess the comparative effectiveness of these interventions for trochanteric fractures by evaluating the surgical performance and postoperative outcomes. Methods: PubMed, Web of Science and Cochrane Central Register were searched for RCTs comparing DHS and PFN for trochanteric fractures. All selected studies and the risk of bias were assessed. Clinical data including operative time, intraoperative blood loss, intraoperative fluoroscopy time, successful closed reduction and complications like nonunion, implant failure and reoperation were recorded. Random-effects models were used in Review Manager software, and GRADE was applied for the interpretation of the evidence. Results: From 286 identified trials, twelve RCTs including 1889 patients were eligible for inclusion; six RCTs directly comparing DHS with PFN, while other six compared DHS with proximal femoral nail antirotation (PFNA). Compared to DHS, PFN had shorter operative time and led to less intraoperative blood loss. However, DHS need less intraoperative fluoroscopy time than PFN. No difference was seen for the achievement of closed reduction. For risk of postoperative complications, no difference was seen between PFN and DHS for non-union, risk of implant failure and revision surgery.

Endoscopic ultrasound-guided biliary drainage (EUS-BD) is a novel technique that allows BD by echoendoscopy and fluoroscopy using a stent from the biliary tree to the gastrointestinal tract. AIM To compare the technical aspects and outcomes of percutaneous transhepatic BD (PTBD) and EUS-BD. METHODS Different databases, including PubMed, Embase, clinicaltrials.gov, the Cochrane library, Scopus, and Google Scholar, were searched according to the guidelines for Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses to obtain studies comparing PTBD and EUS-BD. RESULTS Among the six studies that fulfilled the inclusion criteria, PTBD patients underwent significantly more reinterventions (4.9 vs 1.3), experienced more postprocedural pain (4.1 vs 1.9), and experienced more late adverse events (53.8% vs 6.6%) than EUS-BD patients. There was a significant reduction in the total bilirubin levels in both the groups (16.4-3.3 μmol/L and 17.2-3.8 μmol/L for EUSBD and PTBD, respectively; P = 0.002) at the 7-d follow-up. There were no significant differences observed in the complication rates between PTBD and EUSBD (3.3 vs 3.8). PTBD was associated with a higher adverse event rate than EUSBD in all the procedures, including reinterventions (80.4% vs 15.7%, respectively) and a higher index procedure (39.2% vs 18.2%, respectively). CONCLUSION The findings of this systematic review revealed that EUS-BD is linked with a higher rate of effective BD and a more manageable procedure-related adverse event profile than PTBD. These findings highlight the evidence for successful EUS-BD implementation.  © The Author(s) 2022.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: E.

Humic acid (HA), the main component of soil organic matter, or more specifically, the quinone moieties in HA, is generally regarded as an “electron shuttle” between pollutants and microorganisms, which could promote microbial remediation of contamination. In this study, we examined the dechlorination of PCB153 by adding HA and anthraquinone-2,6-disulfonate (AQDS, a model compound of quinones) to systems containing PCB dechlorinators, analyzed the composition and functional gene network of the microbial community by metagenomics, and explored the role of HA by modifying or substituting carbon sources or electron donors. However, this study found that HA accelerated microbial dechlorination of PCBS, while AQDS did not. Moreover, HA without quinone activity still promoted dechlorination, but not without carbon source or electron donor. Metagenomic analysis showed that HA did not promote the growth of PCB dechlorinator (Dehalococcoides), but the transmembrane electron carriers in the HA group were higher than those in the AQDS group and the control group, so HA may have promoted the electron transport process. This study is helpful for microbial remediation of PCB contamination, and provides new insights into the role that HA plays in the biogeochemical cycle. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.

Methods: Relevant studies from their inception to November 2021 were identified by searching EMBASE, PubMed, and Web of Science. The cohort and case–control studies that reported effect size with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) of EDC exposure and GDM were selected. The heterogeneity among the included studies was quantified by I2 statistic. Publication bias was evaluated through the Begg and Egger tests. Results: Twenty-five articles with a total of 23,796 participants were found. Results indicated that exposure to PCBs has a significant influence on the incidence of GDM (OR = 1.14; 95% CI = 1.00-–1.31; n = 8). The risk of GDM was found to be associated with PBDE exposure (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.15–1.53; n = 4). PAEs and PFASs exposure were also positively associated with the risk of GDM, with summary ORs of 1.10 (95% CI = 1.03–1.16; n = 7 for PAEs) and 1.09 (95% CI = 1.02–1.16; n = 11 for PFASs), respectively. When only cohort studies were considered, the summary OR between PCBs exposure and the risk of GDM was 0.99 (95% CI = 0.91–1.09; n = 5). Meanwhile, the summary ORs from cohort studies for PBDEs, PAEs, and PFASs exposure were 1.12 (95% CI = 1.00–1.26; n = 2), 1.08 (95% CI = 1.02–1.15; n = 5), and 1.06 (95% CI = 1.00–1.12; n = 8), respectively. The Beggs and Egger tests did not show publication bias, and the sensitivity analyses did not change the results in this meta-analysis. Conclusion: These results support that exposure to certain EDCs, including PCBs, PBDEs, PAEs, and PFAS, increase the risk of GDM. Further large-sample epidemiologic researches and mechanistic studies are needed to verify the potential relationship and biological mechanisms. These results are of public health significance because the daily EDC exposure is expected to increase the risk of GDM development.

While it affects positively human nutrient and energy uptake, the presence of pesticide residues could, however, counterbalance these benefits and negatively affect human health. This systematic review provides an overview of studies on pesticide residues during the last decade and the related human health risk assessment. Thirty-five original articles published since 2010 reporting the levels of pesticide residues in raw cow's milk in 69 regions from 15 countries were reviewed. Data showed that pesticide residue levels were ranked as, DDTs> permethrin> bifenthrin> Drins> endrin> endosulfan> HCHs> cyhalothrin> cypermethrin> heptachlor> ethion> coumaphos> deltamethrin> dimethoate, chlorpyriphos> profenofos> malathion> dichlorvos> parathion methyl> carbaryl> aldicarb> carbofuran> methamidophos. High geographic variation was observed, and many regions appear as contaminated zones with high risks such as Punjab in Pakistan (× 3080 > MRL and × 113 > MRL for Cypermethrin and Drins, respectively), Sand Pedro in Columbia (× 1090 > MRL and × 200 > MRL for endrin and Drins, respectively), and Gezira State in Sudan (× 109 > MRL DDTs). The risk assessment for humans indicated that HQ Drins values were > 1 in Columbia (Sucre, Casa Azul, San Pedro, Costanera, Sabanas, Sinú Medio, and San Jorge regions), and in Pakistan (Punjab region). Moreover, the HQ values for endrin were > 1 in Sinú Medio (Colombia) and for heptachlor in Costanera region, Sinú Medio, and Sabanas (Colombia). Furthermore, HI values were > 1 in seven regions in Colombia, 1 region in Pakistan, 1 region in Egypt and 1 region in Turkey, suggesting a serious health risk.

Because of this potential toxicity, the global distribution, quantity, incidence, and potential impacts of deep-sea MPs were investigated in a systematic review of the literature. The results showed that MPs have reached different zones of the ocean and are more frequently reported in the Northern Hemisphere, where higher concentrations are found. MPs are also concentrated in depths up to 3000 m, where they are also more frequently studied, but also extend deeper than 10,000 m. Potentially toxic metals (PTMs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDTs), organotins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were identified as the most prevalent and widely distributed MPs at ≥200 m depth. PTMs are widely distributed in the deep sea in high concentrations; aluminum is the most prevalent up to 3000 m depth, followed by zinc and copper.

Although the volume of literature has shown an annual growth trend, there is no literature available for bibliometric and clinical analysis of the content of multiple databases in this field. Methods: The articles were obtained from the WOSCC, Scopus, Pubmed, and ClinicalTrials on 27 December 2021. Three scientometric software (VOSviewer 1.6.17, CiteSpace 5.8.R.1 and Scimago Graphica) were used to perform bibliometric and knowledge-map analysis. Results: We included 867 articles from WOSCC, 716 articles from Scopus and 6 clinical studies from ClinicalTrials for literature analysis. Our results showed that China was the country with the highest number of publications, with the United States (US) being the leader in terms of international collaborations and the number of citations. Sakai D, Grad S and Hoyland JA had made outstanding contributions for their high productivity and the quality articles. Spine was the most published and most cited journal, in addition to Spine Journal and Biomaterials, which were also more authoritative journals and had received high citations. All of them had received high citations. Keyword co-occurrence studies suggested that the current hotspots were in mechanistic studies, including inflammation, apoptosis, exosome, autophagy, and others. Some studies had also investigated tissue-engineered scaffolds of SCs to better repair degenerated discs. Clinical studies were relatively scarce. Direct injection of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) into degenerated discs for the treatment of Degenerative disc disease (DDD) was the current direction of research. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the global research hotspots, trends and clinical use of SCs in the treatment of IDD. It can help scholars to quickly understand the current status and hotspots of research in this field, and also provide some guidance and reference for those who are currently researching in this area.

However, its potential toxicity on the intestines and gut microbiota remains unknown. In the present study, male mice were orally exposed to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA for 6 weeks, and after total genomic DNA extraction, 16S rRNA amplicon pyrosequencing was performed. Our results demonstrated that HFPO-TA exposure resulted in the imbalance of cecal microbiota and alterations of cecal microbiota diversity. At the phylum level, the relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Deferribacteres, and Tenericutes increased in mice after exposure to HFPO-TA, while the relative abundances of Verrucomicrobia, Cyanobacteria, and TM7 decreased. At the genus level, the relative abundances of Ver Akkermansia, Pre Prevotella, Lac Coprococcus, Por_Parabacteroides, and Lac Dorea decreased in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Meanwhile, the increased relative abundances of Def_Mucispirillum, Des_Desulfovibrio and Odo Odoribacter were observed in HFPO-TA exposed mice. Additionally, KEGG metabolic pathway analysis revealed that HFPO-TA exposure changed the unsaturated fatty acid synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism, galactose metabolism pathway and other metabolic pathways.

Clearly, temperature and insecticide exposure cause changes in the underlying metabolism, and the NMR metabolomic profile enables a direct examination of the immediate response of the vector to cope up with these changes. The present study was designed in four parts: A-Aedes aegypti were exposed to 40 °C for one-hour, DDT-4%, malathion-5%, and deltamethrin-0.05% separately and, part B-D; one-hour exposure at 35 °C and 40 °C temperatures followed by one-hour exposure to insecticide. The resultant metabolite profiles were compared with the control. In response to temperature and insecticide exposure, several metabolites and altered pathways were identified. Citrate, maltose, lipids, Nicotinate, Choline, Pyruvate and β-hydroxybutyrate were found as important components of major biological pathways such as tri-carboxylic acid cycle, branched amino acid degradation, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, amino acid metabolism, lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, nucleotide PRPP pathway, and phospholipid metabolism. Furthermore, the results also suggest that the changes imposed by exposure to temperature and insecticides individually, are reversed with combined exposure, thus negating the impact of each other and posing a threat to the control of Aedes-borne diseases such as dengue, chikungunya, Zika and yellow fever. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 3; Correspondence Address: R.C.

In this study, we demonstrated that oral PFOS exposure (1 μg/g BW and 5 μg/g BW) decreased the function of the Luteinizing hormone (LH)/Luteinizing hormone receptor (LHr) and decreased epididymal sperm motility. Consistently, testicular transcriptome analysis revealed that PFOS altered the expression of a cluster of genes associated with sperm motility and steroidogenesis. In mice exposed to PFOS, c-Fos immunostaining showed activation of the lateral septal nucleus (LS), paraventricular thalamus (PVT), locus coeruleus (LC), which are known to be related to anxiety-like behaviors. Metabolomic analyses of the hypothalamus revealed that exposure to PFOS perturbed the translation of proteins, as well as the biosynthesis of neurotransmitters and neuromodulators. Altogether, the activation of brain nuclei, shift of hypothalamic metabolome, and reduction of LH/LHr circuit resulted from PFOS exposure suggested the toxicant's systematic effects on male reproduction. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: C.K.C.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are emerging contaminants with the characteristics of persistence and bioaccumulation. PFAS exposure can affect the function of the nervous, endocrine, and immune system of animals and humans. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the epidemiological studies investigating potential relationships between PFAS exposure and vaccine antibody levels, and assessed whether PFAS would affect vaccine response in healthy children. A literature search was conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases up to February 2022. We chose studies that measured serum vaccines antibodies and PFAS concentrations of the participants. Essential information, including mean difference of percentage change, regression coefficient, odds ratio, Spearman correlation coefficient, and 95% confidence intervals, were extracted from the selected studies to conduct descriptive analysis and meta-analysis where appropriate. The qualities of these studies were evaluated as well. Finally, nine epidemiological studies about children met our inclusion criteria. A high degree of heterogeneity is observed in terms of breastfeeding time, confounder control, and detection method. Exposure to perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level in children without heterogeneity by Cochran's Q test (p = 0.26; p = 0.55), and exposure to perfluorohexane sulfonate is negatively associated with tetanus antibody level but with heterogeneity (p = 0.04). This comprehensive review suggests that PFAS can have adverse health effects on children by hindering the production of vaccine antibodies. There are some consistent and negative associations between children exposure to certain PFAS and tetanus antibody level. The association of the other four vaccines (measles, rubella, mumps, and influenza) with PFAS remains uncertain, because very few studies are available.

Methods: Following the PRISMA guidelines, a systematic literature review was performed using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from date of inception to June 2022. Studies were selected based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Simultaneously, a retrospective review was conducted of patients who underwent neurosurgical evaluation of suspected PEPA at our institution. Results: Of the 321 articles in the original literature search, 62 were selected. A total of 143 patients (93 men, 27 women; mean age, 70.7 years) diagnosed with PEPA were included. Mean time from carotid endarterectomy to PA diagnosis was 41.8 months. Primary repair data were available for 135 patients, including 19 with primary closures, 112 with patch or graft repairs, and 4 with eversion procedures. Fifty-five patients with PA (39%) presented with infection. Staphylococcal species were the most common causative organism. Of infected PAs, 89.1% were treated with open procedures. Overall complication rates of PAs treated via open, endovascular, and hybrid methods were 31%, 15.4%, and 0%, respectively. Open ligation (42.9%) and aneurysmectomy with grafting (36.4%) resulted in the highest rates of complications. Conclusions: Despite higher complication rates after open repair strategies, use of these techniques remains a viable option in situations requiring removal of infected patches or evacuation of large extravascular collections. Endovascular treatment options are associated with low numbers of complications and can be considered for primary PEPA treatment when infection is not present. © 2022 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: C.

There was a statistically significant difference (p value < 0.05) for revisions OR 0.27 (0.13–0.56), implant-related failures OR 0.16 (0.09–0.27) and proportion of patients complaining of pain OR 0.50 (0.34–0.74). There was no difference in non-unions and Harris hip score (p value > 0.05). There was a significant difference in blood loss and fluoroscopy usage in favour of PFNA, while no difference in operating times was observed between the two devices. Conclusions: Our meta-analysis suggests that a twin-screw integrated cephalomedullary nail (InterTAN) is clinically more effective when compared to a single-screw cephalomedullary nail proximal femoral nail antirotation resulting in fewer complications, fewer revisions and fewer patients complaining of pain. No difference has been established regarding non-unions and Harris hip score. Intra-operative outcomes favour PFNA with less blood loss and fluoroscopy usage. Further studies are warranted to explore the cost-effectiveness of these and other implants in managing patients with intertrochanteric fractures. © 2022, The Author(s).","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: L.

At present, leishmaniasis treatment mainly counts on chemotherapy. The currently available drugs against leishmaniasis are costly, toxic, with multiple side effects, and limitations in the administration route. The rapid emergence of drug resistance has severely reduced the potency of anti-leishmanial drugs. As a result, there is a pressing need for the development of novel anti-leishmanial drugs with high potency, low cost, acceptable toxicity, and good pharmacokinetics features. Due to the availability of preclinical data, drug repurposing is a valuable approach for speeding up the development of effective anti-leishmanial through pointing to new drug targets in less time, having low costs and risk. Metabolic pathways of this parasite play a crucial role in the growth and proliferation of Leishmania species during the various stages of their life cycle. Based on available genomics/proteomics information, known pathways-based (sterol biosynthetic pathway, purine salvage pathway, glycolysis, GPI biosynthesis, hypusine, polyamine biosynthesis) Leishmania-specific proteins could be targeted with known drugs that were used in other diseases, resulting in finding new promising anti-leishmanial therapeutics. The present review discusses various metabolic pathways of the Leishmania parasite and some drug candidates targeting these pathways effectively that could be potent drugs against leishmaniasis in the future. © 2022 by the authors.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: P.

We employed a combination of traditional morphological and bulk macroinvertebrate metabarcoding analyses to benthic samples collected from Toronto Harbour (Ontario, Canada) to compare taxonomic and functional diversity of macroinvertebrates and their responses to environmental gradients. At the species rank, sites assessed using COI metabarcoding showed more variation than sites assessed using morphological methods. Depending on the assessment method, we detected gradients in magnesium (morphological taxa), ammonia (morphological taxa, COI sequence variants), pH (18S sequence variants) as well as gradients in contaminants such as metals (COI & 18S sequence variants) and organochlorines (COI sequence variants). Observed responses to contaminants such as aromatic hydrocarbons and metals align with known patchy distributions in harbour sediments. We determined that the morphological approach may limit the detection of macroinvertebrate responses to lake environmental conditions due to the effort needed to obtain fine level taxonomic assignments necessary to investigate responses. DNA metabarcoding, however, need not be limited to macroinvertebrates, can be automated, and taxonomic assignments are associated with a certain level of accuracy from sequence variants to named taxonomic groups.

However, before biomarkers could be deployed within diagnostic studies, systematic evidence of the robustness of such biomarkers to detect effects is needed. In our study, we present an approach for conducting a meta-analysis of the robustness of gene expression-based biomarkers in soil invertebrates. The approach was developed and trialed for two measurements of gene expression commonly proposed as biomarkers in soil ecotoxicology: earthworm metallothionein (MT) gene expression for metals and earthworm heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) gene expression for organic chemicals. We collected 294 unique gene expression data points from the literature and used linear mixed-effect models to assess concentration, exposure duration, and species effects on the quantified response. The meta-analysis showed that the expression of earthworm MT was strongly metal concentration dependent, stable over time and species independent. The metal concentration-dependent response was strongest for cadmium, indicating that this gene is a suitable biomarker for this metal. For copper, no clear concentration-dependent response of MT gene expression in earthworms was found, indicating MT is not a reliable biomarker for this metal. For HSP70, overall marginal up-regulation and lack of a concentration-dependent response indicated that this gene is not suitable as a biomarker for organic pollutant effects in earthworms. The present study demonstrates how meta-analysis can be used to assess the status of biomarkers. We encourage colleagues to apply this open-access approach to other biomarkers, as such quantitative assessment is a prerequisite to ensuring that the suitability and limitations of proposed biomarkers are known and stated.

Few studies have examined exposure at reproductive organs. Our aim was to perform a preliminary untargeted metabolomic characterization of menstrual blood, a novel biofluid, to identify environmental toxins present in the endometrium and evaluate the suitability of this sample type for exposome research. Methods: Whole blood menstrual samples were collected from four women using a menstrual cup. Samples were analyzed for small molecules that include both environmental chemicals and endogenous metabolites using untargeted liquid chromatography with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS). Principal component analysis (PCA) and ANOVA was used to identify differences within and between individuals' menstrual blood metabolomic profiles, and the influence of the sample processing method. To assess the presence of environmental exposures, LC-HRMS chemical profiles were matched to the ToxCast chemical database, which includes 4557 commonly used commercial chemicals. Select compounds were confirmed by comparison to reference standards. Results: PCA of metabolome profiles showed analysis of menstrual blood samples were highly reproducible, with high variability in detected metabolites between participants and low variability between analytical replicates of an individual's sample. Endogenous metabolites detected in menstrual blood samples achieved good coverage of the human blood metabolome. We found 1748 annotations for environmental chemicals, including suspected reproductive toxicants such as phenols, parabens, phthalates, and organochlorines. Storage temperature for the first 24 h did not significantly influence global metabolomic profiles.

Bioremediation is a more cost-effective and ecologically responsible means of removing heavy metals than conventional alternatives. As a result, microorganisms have emerged as a necessary component of methyl breakdown and detoxification via metabolic reactions and hereditary characteristics. The utmost operative variant for confiscating substantial metals commencing contaminated soil was A. niger, which had a maximum bioaccumulation efficiency of 98% (Cd) and 43% (Cr). Biosensor bacteria are both environmentally sustainable and cost-effective. As a result, microbes have a range of metal absorption processes that allow them to have higher metal biosorption capabilities. Additionally, the biosorption potential of bacterium, fungus, biofilm, and algae, inherently handled microorganisms that immobilized microbial cells for the elimination of heavy metals, was reviewed in this study. Furthermore, we discuss some of the challenges and opportunities associated with producing effective heavy metal removal techniques, such as those that employ different types of nanoparticles. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: M.

We reviewed studies on systemic antibiotic use (WHO ATC/DDD category J01) for human health in Indonesia, and synthesized available evidence to identify opportunities for intervention. Methods: We systematically searched five international and national databases for eligible peer-reviewed articles, in English and Indonesian, published between 1 January 2000 and 1 June 2021 including: (1) antibiotic consumption; (2) prescribing appropriateness; (3) antimicrobial stewardship (AMS); (4) consumers’ and providers’ perceptions. Two independent reviewers included studies and extracted data. Study-level data were summarized using random-effects model meta-analysis for consumption and prescribing appropriateness, effect direction analysis for antimicrobial stewardship (AMS) interventions, and qualitative synthesis for perception surveys. (PROSPERO: CRD42019134641) Findings: Of 9323 search hits, we included 100 reports on antibiotic consumption (20), prescribing appropriateness (49), AMS interventions (13), and/or perception (25) (8 categorized in >1 domain). The pooled estimate of overall antibiotic consumption was 134.8 DDD per 100 bed-days (95%CI 82.5–187.0) for inpatients and 121.1 DDD per 1000 inhabitants per day (10.4-231.8) for outpatients. Ceftriaxone, levofloxacin, and ampicillin were the most consumed antibiotics in inpatients, and amoxicillin, ciprofloxacin, and cefadroxil in outpatients. Pooled estimates for overall appropriate prescribing (according to Gyssens method) were 33.5% (18.1–53.4) in hospitals and 49.4% (23.7–75.4) in primary care. Pooled estimates for appropriate prescribing (according to reference guidelines) were, in hospitals, 99.7% (97.4–100) for indication, 84.9% (38.5-98.0) for drug choice, and 6.1% (0.2–63.2) for overall appropriateness, and, in primary care, 98.9% (60.9-100) for indication, 82.6% (50.5–95.7) for drug choice and 10.5% (0.8–62.6) for overall appropriateness. Studies to date evaluating bundled AMS interventions, although sparse and heterogeneous, suggested favourable effects on antibiotic consumption, prescribing appropriateness, guideline compliance, and patient outcomes. Key themes identified in perception surveys were lack of community antibiotic knowledge, and common non-prescription antibiotic self-medication. Interpretation: Context-specific intervention strategies are urgently needed to improve appropriate antibiotic use in Indonesian hospitals and communities, with critical evidence gaps concerning the private and informal healthcare sectors.

The results shows that the eontent of heavy metals in the surface sediments of Zhenzhu Bay mangrove wetland is relatively low compared with other mangrove wetlands in China. Only some stations showed weak Cd and Hg pollution and most stations wasn't plolluted by heavy metals, with two showed weak Cd and Hg pollution according to the geo-aeeumulation index, and all stations in the bay are at low ecological risk based on potential risk index method. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis show that Cd was mainly affected by the input of Jiangping River and mariculture in the southeast of Zhenzhu Bay, and other elements were mainly affected by the weathering and normal deposition of natural background rocks.

The issues of species differences between humans and rodents, the animal ethical concerns and the time and cost required for neurotoxicity studies on in vivo animal models, do limit the use of animal-based models in neurotoxicology. In this context, human cell models appear relevant in elucidating cellular and molecular impacts of neurotoxicants and facilitating prioritization of in vivo testing. The SH-SY5Y human neuroblastoma cell line (ATCC® CRL-2266™) is one of the most used cell lines in neurosciences, either undifferentiated or differentiated into neuron-like cells. This review presents the characteristics of the SH-SY5Y cell line and proposes the results of a systematic review of literature on the use of this in vitro cell model for neurotoxicity research by focusing on organic environmental pollutants including pesticides, 2, 3, 7, 8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD), flame retardants, PFASs, parabens, bisphenols, phthalates, and PAHs. Organic environmental pollutants are widely present in the environment and increasingly known to cause clinical neurotoxic effects during fetal & child development and adulthood. Their effects on cultured SH-SY5Y cells include autophagy, cell death (apoptosis, pyroptosis, necroptosis, or necrosis), increased oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, disruption of neurotransmitter homeostasis, and alteration of neuritic length.

Performing a systematic review and meta-analysis, PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and ScienceDirect were searched for studies reporting the risk of MetS following pesticides exposure and their contaminants. We included 12 studies for a total of 6789 participants, in which 1981 (29.1%) had a MetS. Overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk of MetS by 30% (95CI 22%–37%). Overall organochlorine increased the risk of MetS by 23% (14–32%), as well as for most types of organochlorines: hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk by 53% (28–78%), hexachlorobenzene by 40% (0.01–80%), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene by 22% (9–34%), dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane by 28% (5–50%), oxychlordane by 24% (1–47%), and transnonchlor by 35% (19–52%). Sensitivity analyses confirmed that overall exposure to pesticides and their contaminants increased the risk by 46% (35–56%) using crude data or by 19% (10–29%) using fully-adjusted model. The risk for overall pesticides and types of pesticides was also significant with crude data but only for hexachlorocyclohexane (36% risk increase, 17–55%) and transnonchlor (25% risk increase, 3–48%) with fully-adjusted models. Metaregressions demonstrated that hexachlorocyclohexane increased the risk of MetS in comparison to most other pesticides. The risk increased for more recent periods (Coefficient = 0.28, 95CI 0.20 to 0.37, by year). We demonstrated an inverse relationship with body mass index and male gender. In conclusion, pesticides exposure is a major risk factor for MetS. Besides organochlorine exposure, data are lacking for other types of pesticides. The risk increased with time, reflecting a probable increase of the use of pesticides worldwide.

Emerging findings suggest that non-communicable diseases are linked to early and chronic environmental exposures. However, the rapid globalisation in developing countries, environmental change and the emergence, spread, persistence and severity of infectious diseases are not yet well understood. The aim of this study is to understand which environmental toxicants are commonly associated with infectious diseases in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods and analysis A total of four electronic databases, MEDLINE through PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and CENTRAL (the Cochrane Library) be searched to identify relevant studies and will be screened by two independent reviewers. The Cochrane risk of bias (ROB) tool for randomised control trials (RCTs) and ROB assessment tool for non-randomised studies for non-RCTs will be used to assess the ROB. A meta-analysis will be used to determine the pooled effect if we find out the included articles have similar environmental exposure, participant groups, study design and outcome measures. A narrative synthesis of the findings will be provided, along with summaries of the intervention effect. Heterogeneity between the studies will be assessed, and sensitivity analysis will be conducted based on study quality. Ethics and dissemination Findings will be summarised in a single manuscript. This review attempts to explore the pivotal role of environmental toxicants in predisposing, developing, persistent and severity of infectious diseases in LMICs. Findings from this study will highlight the effects of individual environmental toxicants' role on infectious disease outcomes for the early prevention and limit toxic exposure to guide individual, community, and occupational health policy for future strategies.

However, undesired side effects, unsatisfactory response rates, tumor metastasis, and drug resistance still hinder the further application of ICB therapy against CRC. Advancing ICB with nanotechnology can be game-changing. With the development of immuno-oncology and nanomaterials, various nanoplatforms have been fabricated to enhance the efficacy of ICB in CRC treatment. Herein, this review systematically summarizes these recent nano-strategies according to their mechanisms. Despite their diverse and complex designs, these nanoplatforms have four main mechanisms in enhancing ICB: 1) targeting immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) to tumor foci, 2) increasing tumor immunogenicity, 3) remodeling tumor microenvironment, and 4) pre-sensitizing immune systems. Importantly, advantages of nanotechnology in CRC, such as innovating the mode-of-actions of ICB, modulating intestinal microbiome, and integrating the whole process of antigen presentation, are highlighted in this review. In general, this review describes the latest applications of nanotechnology for CRC immunotherapy, and may shed light on the future design of ICB platforms.

In this study, we investigated the potential health effects of organohalogen compounds (OHCs) on thyroid hormone (TH) homeostasis and metabolomics in Japanese pet cats. There was a significant negative correlation between concentrations of several contaminants, such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), hydroxylated PCBs (OH-PCBs), hydroxylated PBDEs (OH-PBDEs), and THs in cat serum samples. These results suggested that exposure to OHCs causes a decrease in serum TH levels in pet cats. In this metabolomics study, each exposure level of parent compounds (PCBs and PBDEs) and their hydroxylated compounds (OH-PCBs and OH-PBDEs) were associated with their own unique primary metabolic pathways, suggesting that parent and phenolic compounds exhibit different mechanisms of action and biological effects. PCBs were associated with many metabolic pathways, including glutathione and purine metabolism, and the effects were replicated in in-vivo cat PCB administration studies.

Objective: To form a tool (a series of criteria) for detecting potentially inappropriate prescriptions in children, promote clinical rational drug use and reduce risks of medication in children. Methods: Potentially inappropriate prescription propositions for children were collected through a systematic review. Then, the Delphi technique was adopted to form the final criteria. Panelists were asked to use a 5-point Likert scale to rate their agreement with each potentially inappropriate prescription proposition and were encouraged to add new propositions based on their clinical experience and knowledge. After 2 rounds of Delphi survey and propositions were fully revised and improved, the final criteria for identifying potentially inappropriate prescriptions in children were formed. Results: The final criteria for identifying potential inappropriate prescriptions in children has 136 propositions, which were divided into “criteria for children with non-specific diseases/conditions” (71 propositions: 68 for potentially inappropriate medication, 3 for potential prescribing omission) and “criteria for children with specific diseases/conditions” (65 propositions: 55 for potentially inappropriate medication, 10 for potential prescribing omission), according to whether the proposition was about identifying specific risks associated with one drug in children with a specific other diseases/conditions that do not exist in children with other diseases/conditions. Conclusion: A tool for screening potentially inappropriate prescriptions in children is formed to detect potentially inappropriate medication and prescribing omission in pediatrics and is available to all medical professionals liable to prescribe or dispense medicines to children.

This study systematically investigated the comprehensive effects of a typical antibiotic (sulfadimidine, SDM) in livestock and poultry breeding wastewater on the anammox process, with the aim of elucidating the intracellular and extracellular protective mechanisms of the anammox consortia to the antibiotic stress. Results revealed that the high-concentration SDM significantly reduced the specific anammox activity (SAA) by 37.8%. Changes in the abundance of Candidatus Kuenenia showed a similar trend with that of SAA, while other nitrogen-related microorganisms (e.g., Nitrosomonas and Nitrospira) contributed to the nitrogen removal especially during the inhibitory period. Resistance of the anammox consortia to SDM mainly depended on the protection of ARGs and EPS. Network analysis revealed the host range of eARGs was relatively larger than that of iARGs, and intI1 was closely associated with representative denitrifiers. In addition, metaproteomic analysis and molecular docking results indicated that abundant proteins in EPS could detain SDM in the extracellular matrix through forming complex via hydrogen bond. These findings provide a guidance for the stable operation of anammox process and ARGs transfer controlling. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: N.-S.

The study of fetal signals poses specific challenges. Metabolomic analysis of maternal blood, the cord artery (CA), and cord vein (CV), allows simultaneous interrogation of multiple metabolic pathways associated with different modes of labour onset and birth. Methods: Global mass spectrometry metabolomics analysis was performed on serial samples collected from participants during pregnancy, in latent phase of labour, and following birth (CA, CV, and intervillous (IV) blood), from those who spontaneously laboured and birthed vaginally (SL group), had IOL and birthed vaginally (IOL group), or birthed via elective caesarean section (no labour; ECS group). Results: There were clear differences in fetal and maternal steroid, arachidonate and sphingosine pathways between the SL and IOL groups, despite similar uterine contractions and vaginal birth. The CA/CV ratio for key steroids of the IOL group were more alike the ECS group than the SL group, including progesterone (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=3.5; IOL group=0.5; and ECS group=0.5), and oestriol (CA/CV ratio for: SL group=4.3; IOL group=0.4; and for ECS group=0.2). There were no such changes in the maternal samples. Discussion: These findings indicate that IOL does not reproduce the pathways activated in spontaneous labour. The decreased placental progesterone production observed with spontaneous labour may represent a local intrauterine progesterone withdrawal, which, together with other signals, would activate parturition pathways involving arachidonate and sphingosine metabolism. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: K.A.

Despite their abundance in AFFF, information is lacking on the potential transformation of these polyfluoroalkyl substances. Due to the biological and chemical stability of the repeating perfluoroalkyl -(CF2)n- moiety common to all known AFFF-derived PFASs, it is not immediately evident whether the microbial biotransformation mechanisms observed for other organic contaminants also govern the microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances. Herein, we aim to: 1) review the literature on the aerobic or anaerobic microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances in environmental media; 2) compile and summarize proposed microbial biotransformation pathways for major classes of polyfluoroalkyl substances; 3) identify the dominant biotransformation intermediates and terminal biotransformation products; and 4) discuss these findings in the context of environmental monitoring and source allocation. This analysis revealed that much more is currently known about aerobic microbial biotransformation of polyfluoroalkyl substances, as compared to anaerobic biotransformation. Further, there are some similarities in microbial biotransformations of fluorotelomer and electrochemical fluorination-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, but differences may be largely due to head group composition. Dealkylation, oxidation, and hydrolytic reactions appear to be particularly important for microbial biotransformation of AFFF-derived polyfluoroalkyl substances, and these biotransformations may lead to formation of some semi-stable intermediates.

Although attention to effects of exposure to mixtures of PFAS has grown in recent years, there is no consensus on the appropriate statistical methods that can be used to assess their combined effect on human health. Objectives: We aim to perform a comprehensive review of the statistical methods used in the existing studies which evaluate the association between exposure to mixtures of PFAS and any adverse human health effect. Methods: The online databases PubMed, Embase and Scopus were searched for eligible studies, published during the last ten years (last search performed on April 08, 2021). Covidence software was used by two different reviewers to perform a title/abstract screening, followed by a full text revision of the selected papers. Results: A total of 3640 papers were identified, and after the screening process, 53 papers were included in the current review. Most of the studies were published between 2019 and 2021 and were conducted mainly in North America and Europe; more than half of the studies (28 out of 53) were conducted on mother and child pairs. WQS (Weighted Quantile Sum) Regression and BKMR (Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression) were used in 36 out of 53 papers to model mixtures’ effects. Health outcomes included in the studies are immunotoxicity (n = 8), fetal development (n = 7), neurodevelopment (n = 9), reproductive hormones (n = 6), thyroid hormones (n = 7), outcomes related to metabolic pathways (n = 16). Conclusion: Studies on human exposure to PFAS as complex mixtures and health consequences have substantially increased in the last few years. Based on our findings, we propose that addressing risk from PFAS mixtures will likely require combinations of approaches and implementation of constantly evolving statistical methods.

Owing to their adverse effects on human health and environment, efficient methods of their removal from various complex matrices need to be developed. This review focuses on recent results addressing the adsorption of PFAS on activated carbons (AC) and metal-organic frameworks (MOF). While the former are well-established adsorbents used in water treatment, the latter are relatively new and still not applied at a large scale. Nevertheless, they attract research interests owing to their developed porosity and versatile surface chemistry. While AC provide high volumes of pores and hydrophobic surfaces to strongly attract fluorinated chains, MOF supply sites for acid-base complexation and a variety of specific interactions. The modifications of AC are focused on the introduction of basicity to attract PFAS anions via electrostatic/chemical interactions, and those of MOF - on structural defects to increase the pore sizes. Based on the comparison of the performance and specifically adsorption forces provided by these two groups of materials, activated carbons were pointed out as worthy of further research efforts. This is because their surface, especially that in large pores, where dispersive forces are week and where extensive pore space might be utilized to adsorb more PFAS, can be further chemically modified and these modifications might be informed by the mechanisms of PFAS adsorption, which are specific for MOF. This review emphasizes the effects of these modifications on the adsorption mechanism and brings the critical assessment of the advantages/disadvantages of both groups as PFAS adsorbents. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 78; Correspondence Address: T.J.

We combined a meta-analysis of nationwide measurements and air quality modeling to identify efficiency gains by striking a balance between controlling NH3 and acid gas (SO2 and NOx) emissions. We found that PM2.5 concentrations decreased from 2000 to 2019, but annual mean PM2.5 concentrations still exceeded 35 μgm-3 at 74% of 1498 monitoring sites during 2015-2019. The concentration of PM2.5 and its components were significantly higher (16 %-195 %) on hazy days than on non-hazy days. Compared with mean values of other components, this difference was more significant for the secondary inorganic ions SO2-4, NO-3, and NHC4+ (average increase 98 %). While sulfate concentrations significantly decreased over this period, no significant change was observed for nitrate and ammonium concentrations. Model simulations indicate that the effectiveness of a 50% NH3 emission reduction for controlling secondary inorganic aerosol (SIA) concentrations decreased from 2010 to 2017 in four megacity clusters of eastern China, simulated for the month of January under fixed meteorological conditions (2010). Although the effectiveness further declined in 2020 for simulations including the natural experiment of substantial reductions in acid gas emissions during the COVID-19 pandemic, the resulting reductions in SIA concentrations were on average 20.8% lower than those in 2017. In addition, the reduction in SIA concentrations in 2017 was greater for 50% acid gas reductions than for the 50% NH3 emission reductions. Our findings indicate that persistent secondary inorganic aerosol pollution in China is limited by emissions of acid gases, while an additional control of NH3 emissions would become more important as reductions of SO2 and NOx emissions progress.

Xenobiotic metabolism, transformation, excretion, and coexistence with other endogenous molecules, however, greatly complicate the interpretation of features detected in nontargeted studies. While mass spectrometry (MS)-based platforms are commonly used in metabolomic measurements, deconvoluting endogenous metabolites from xenobiotics is also often challenged by the lack of xenobiotic parent and metabolite standards as well as the numerous isomers possible for each small molecule m/z feature. Here, we evaluate a xenobiotic structural annotation workflow using ion mobility spectrometry coupled with MS (IMS-MS), mass defect filtering, and machine learning to uncover potential xenobiotic classes and species in large metabolomic feature lists. Xenobiotic classes examined included those of known high toxicities, including per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), and pesticides. Specifically, when the workflow was applied to identify PFAS in the NIST SRM 1957 and 909c human serum samples, it greatly reduced the hundreds of detected liquid chromatography (LC)-IMS-MS features by utilizing both mass defect filtering and m/z versus IMS collision cross sections relationships. These potential PFAS features were then compared to the EPA CompTox entries, and while some matched within specific m/z tolerances, there were still many unknowns illustrating the importance of nontargeted studies for detecting new molecules with known chemical characteristics. Additionally, this workflow can also be utilized to evaluate other xenobiotics and enable more confident annotations from nontargeted studies. © 2022 American Chemical Society.

These maps can provide an overview of available studies and relevant study information to be used for various research objectives and applications. Environmental epidemiological studies that examine the impact of chemical exposures on various ‘omic profiles in human populations provide relevant mechanistic information and can be used for benchmark dose modeling to derive potential human health reference values. Objectives: To create a systematic evidence map of environmental epidemiological studies examining environmental contaminant exposures with ‘omics in order to characterize the extent of available studies for future research needs. Methods: Systematic review methods were used to search and screen the literature and included the use of machine learning methods to facilitate screening studies. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were developed to identify and screen relevant studies. Studies that met the PECO criteria after full-text review were summarized with information such as study population, study design, sample size, exposure measurement, and ‘omics analysis. Results: Over 10,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes were used to identify 84 studies considered PECO-relevant after full-text review. Various contaminants (e.g. phthalate, benzene, arsenic, etc.) were investigated in epidemiological studies that used one or more of the four ‘omics of interest: epigenomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics. The epidemiological study designs that were used to explore single or integrated ‘omic research questions with contaminant exposures were cohort studies, controlled trials, cross-sectional, and case-control studies. An interactive web-based systematic evidence map was created to display more study-related information. Conclusions: This systematic evidence map is a novel tool to visually characterize the available environmental epidemiological studies investigating contaminants and biological effects using ‘omics technology and serves as a resource for investigators and allows for a range of applications in chemical research and risk assessment needs. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: S.

Objective: We conducted a literature review on the bulking agents used in the treatment of SUI, their indications and the different techniques of injection. Material and methods: The literature review followed PRISMA guidelines. We used the Mesh terms: urinary, incontinence, and bulking to search the PubMed database, from the date of conception until June 2020. All studies modalities were included and references lists were also reviewed for relevant articles. Our search identified 60 articles published between 2001 and 2020. References lists review allowed the addition of 40 more articles. In total, 54 articles were included in the descriptive analysis. Results: Bulking agents that are used nowadays are the glutaraldehyde cross-linked bovine collagen, polydimethylsiloxane, calcium hydroxyapatite, porcine dermal implants, carbon coated zirconium beads, and the polyacrylamide hydrogel. Cure rates of bulking agents are lower compared to surgical management. Periurethral injection was found to be beneficial in patients who refuse or who are inadequate for surgical management, or after the failure of the latter. It can be performed via paraurethral or transurethral routes, with comparable efficacy. Ultrasonic, radiographic or endoscopic assistance allow better precision and control of the procedure. Paraurethral route is associated with bigger injected volumes, higher costs, and more complications. Studies showed superiority of the injections in the mid-urethra, in horseshoe or circumferential template. Conclusion: The identification of optimal bulking agent is difficult. The choice of the agent currently depends on the availability, doctor's preference, cost, and the ease of use. © 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS; Contexte: L'injection peri-urétrale d'agents comblant est une option thérapeutique peu invasive pour l'incontinence urinaire d'effort (IUE).

Digestive gland is the key organ of aquatic animal metabolism for storing nutrition and supplying energy. It participates in a variety of life activities (such as growth, digestion, immunity, and reproduction). Nutrients stored in digestive glands, especially lipids, provide energy for reproductive behaviors such as gametogenesis and ovulation. A large number of studies have confirmed the accumulation of lipids from digestive gland to gonad during gametogenesis. At present, the research on the interference mechanism of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) on lipid metabolism of aquatic animals and the adaptive response of aquatic animals to POPs stress focus on biochemical levels or a few genes. The potential molecular mechanism of lipid metabolism interference needs to be further studied. In addition, as an important stage of aquatic animals, the reproductive period is a vigorous period of lipid metabolism. However, at present, there is no report on the molecular mechanism of POPs interfering with the lipid metabolism of the digestive gland in the reproductive process of aquatic animals. In this study, female scallop C. farreri was cultured in natural seawater and exposed to 4 μg/L B[a]P in seawater. Transcriptome analysis of digestive glands at multiple stages (proliferative stage, growth stage, mature stage and spawn stage) was performed, and iPath pathway analysis was used to analyze lipid metabolism pathways and differential genes. The interference mechanism of lipid metabolism in bivalves during reproductive period was revealed. This study will provide valuable genomic information on the role of digestive glands in lipid metabolism and reproduction of C. farreri, and will contribute to further functional genomics of bivalves and other closely related species. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: L.

This study aimed to perform a meta-analysis to identify the association between PFAS and the risk of GDM. Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Ovid, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science databases for appropriate articles about the association between PFASs exposure and the risk of GDM before September 28, 2020. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized by Stata 16.0 through fixed effect models according to heterogeneity. We also carried out subgroup analyses by geographic location, blood sampling time of subjects, method of chemical analysis, study design, sample size, and sampling year. In addition, a sensitivity analysis was conducted to explore the robustness of the results. Results: A total of eight studies involving 5654 pregnant women were included in the meta-analysis. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) exposure was positively and significantly associated with the risk of GDM (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.02–1.59). Exposure to other types of PFASs such as perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS), perfluorohexane sulfonate (PFHxS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) was not statistically significantly associated with the risk of GDM with the pooled effect estimates of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.86–1.09), 1.03 (95% CI: 0.86–1.24), and 0.80 (95% CI: 0.55–1.16) respectively. Conclusion: We conducted a meta-analysis to investigate the association between PFASs exposure and GDM and found that PFOA concentration was significantly associated with a higher risk of GDM, which is of great significance for the prevention and control of GDM in public health.

Little is known, however, about the prevalence of bacterial dechlorination in deep terrestrial environments with a limited carbon supply. In this study we analyzed published genomes from three deep terrestrial subsurface sites: a deep aquifer in Western Siberia, the Sanford Underground Research Facility in South Dakota, USA, and the Soudan Underground Iron Mine (SUIM) in Minnesota, USA to determine if there was evidence to suggest that microbial dehalogenation was possible in these environments. Diverse dehalogenase genes were present in all analyzed metagenomes, with reductive dehalogenase and haloalkane dehalogenase genes the most common. Taxonomic analysis of both hydrolytic and reductive dehalogenase genes was performed to explore their affiliation; this analysis indicated that at the SUIM site, hydrolytic dehalogenase genes were taxonomically affiliated with Marinobacter species. Because of this affiliation, experiments were also performed with Marinobacter subterrani strain JG233 ('JG233'), an organism containing three predicted hydrolytic dehalogenase genes and isolated from the SUIM site, to determine whether hydrolytic dehalogenation was an active process and involved in growth on a chlorocarboxylic acid. Presence of these genes in genome appears to be functional, as JG233 was capable of chloroacetate dechlorination with simultaneous chloride release. Stable isotope experiments combined with confocal Raman microspectroscopy demonstrated that JG233 incorporated carbon from 13C-chloroacetate into its biomass. These experiments suggest that organisms present in these extreme and often low-carbon environments are capable of reductive and hydrolytic dechlorination and, based on laboratory experiments, may use this capability as a competitive advantage by utilizing chlorinated organic compounds for growth, either directly or after dechlorination.  © 2022 The Author(s) 2022.

Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score = 6.20, p < 0:001), PFOS (z-score = 3.55, p < 0:001), and PFNA (z-score = 2.27, p = 0:023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10092. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

Objectives: This study aimed to provide the first comparison of steroids + local anesthetic (LA) or LA alone for the treatment of DDD. Study Design: We systematically searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and Cochrane. A systemic review and meta-analysis were performed to assess the clinical efficacy of both the steroids + LA group and the LA alone group, and subgroup analysis was also adopted. Setting: A systematic review and meta-analysis using a random effects model on randomized controlled studies (RCTs). Methods: After reviewing titles, abstracts, risk of bias, and full texts of 15,889 studies that were chosen following removal of duplicates after the initial database search, finally, 19 RCTs were included. Pain rating, functional score, follow-up period, and other-related data were extracted from these included works, and the effect size and statistical significance were calculated by the random effects model. The quality and level of the derived evidence were assessed by means of the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation method. Results: In terms of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS-11) and Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) at one year, the combination of steroids + LA was obviously superior to LA. Subgroup analysis suggested that the combination of steroids + LA was more effective than LA alone in regard to the ODI in the lumbar group within 2 years. The opioids intake of patients treated by LA alone was less than that of the steroids + LA group within 3 months, and LA alone was more effective in pain score reduction, with more than 50% within 6 months in the interlaminar injection group. However, the combination of steroids + LA was more effective when alleviating the NRS-11 within 18 months in the caudal injection group. Limitations: Firstly, this analysis was inconsistent in technique, dosage, injection frequency, and follow-up period of epidural injections. Such differences may compromise the reported efficacy. Secondly, adverse reactions arising out of the 2 groups were not examined in that the included RCTs did not provide the data. Thirdly, different injection methods would compromise the outcomes, and no subgroup analysis was performed on different injection methods. Finally, these included articles that were mainly sourced from Manchikanti’s team, and thus biased to some extent. Conclusions: The addition of steroids to anesthetic injectates was associated with a better NRS-11 and ODI compared with LA alone within one year in patients with DDD. Furthermore, the improvement of the ODI was observed within 2 years in patients with lumbar DDD. © 2022, American Society of Interventional Pain Physicians.

EPs are detected in all the environmental matrices at higher levels. A suitable model for aquatic toxicity assessment is Hydra, because of morphological, behavioral, reproductive (sexual and asexual), and biochemical changes. Many researchers have used Hydra for toxicity assessment of organic chemicals (BPA), heavy metals, pharmaceuticals, nanomaterials and microplastics. Various Hydra species were used for environmental toxicity studies; however H. magnipapillata was predominantly used due to the availability of its genome and proteome sequences. Teratogenic and reproductive changes in Hydra are species specific. Teratogenic effects were studied using sterozoom dissecting microscope, acridine orange (AO) and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DPAI) staining. Reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation by EPs had been understood by the Dichlorodihydrofluorescein Diacetate (DCFDA) staining and comet assay. Multiple advanced techniques would aid to understand the effects at molecular level, such as real-time PCR, rapid amplification of cDNA end- PCR. EPs modulated the major antioxidant enzyme levels, therefore, defense mechanism was affected by the higher generation of reactive oxygen species. Genome sequencing helps to know the mode of action of pollutants, role of enzymes in detoxification, defense genes and stress responsive genes.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis and provide insight into what types of nutrients and pollutants seabirds are transporting, the influence these subsidies are having on recipient environments, with a particular focus on soil, and what may happen if seabird populations decline. The addition of guano to colony soils increased nutrient levels compared to control soils for all seabirds studied, with cascading positive effects observed across a range of habitats. Deposited guano sometimes led to negative impacts, such as guanotrophication, or guano-induced eutrophication, which was often observed where there was an excess of guano or in areas with high seabird densities. While the literature describing nutrients transported by seabirds is extensive, literature regarding pollutant transfer is comparatively limited, with a focus on toxic and bioaccumulative metals. Research on persistent organic pollutants and plastics transported by seabirds is likely to increase in coming years. Studies were limited geographically, with hotspots of research activity in a few locations, but data were lacking from large regions around the world. Studies were also limited to seabird species listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. As seabird populations are impacted by multiple threats and steep declines have been observed for many species world-wide, gaps in the literature are particularly concerning. The loss of seabirds will impact nutrient cycling at localized levels and potentially on a global scale as well, yet it is unknown what may truly happen to areas that rely on seabirds if these populations disappear. © 2022 The Authors.

To address this need, 113 participants among households served by a range of water providers across the Guatemala City metropolitan area were recruited as participatory scientists to collect first-draw and flushed tap water samples at their residence. Samples were transported to the U.S. and analyzed for 20 metals and 25 per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). At least one metal exceeded the Guatemalan Maximum Permissible Limit (MPL) for drinking water in 63% of households (n = 71). Arsenic and lead exceeded the MPL in 33.6% (n = 38) and 8.9% (n = 10) of samples, respectively. Arsenic was strongly associated with groundwater while lead occurrence was not associated with location, water source, or provider. One or more PFAS were detected in 19% of samples (n = 21, range 2.1–64.2 ppt). PFAS were significantly associated with the use of plastic water storage tanks but not with location, water source, or provider.

Trace metal concentrations were determined using graphite furnace absorption spectrometry and flame absorption spectrometry. The two organochlorine pesticides (Aldrin and Chlordane) residues were determined by GC–MS and found as below detection level (BDL). The trace metal concentrations (mg/kg-ww) in imported fish samples ranged as As 0.008 to 0.558, Pb 0.004 to 0.070, Cr 0.010 to 0.109, Cd 0.00 to 0.083, Ni 0.011 to 0.059, Co BDL to 0.067, Mn BDL to 0.0780, Fe 1.780 to 10.77, Cu 0.055 to 0.632, and Zn 0.898 to 9.245. Concentrations of As and Cd were higher than the food safety guideline. Considering the source country of imported fishes, fish samples from Oman were mostly contaminated by the trace metals. The estimated daily intake (EDI) was higher for Cr. However, the target hazard quotient (THQ) for individual metal and total THQ for combined metals were lower than 1, indicating no apparent non-carcinogenic health risk for consumers. The cancer risk (CR) was within the acceptable range. But extensive monitoring of these toxic chemicals is needed prior to import these fishes to the country.

Chronic PFAS exposure have been linked to increased prostate cancer risk in occupational settings, however, underlying mechanisms have not been interrogated. Herein we examined exposure of normal human prostate stem-progenitor cells (SPCs) to 10 nM PFOA or PFOS using serial passage of prostasphere cultures. Exposure to either PFAS for 3–4 weeks increased spheroid numbers and size indicative of elevated stem cell self-renewal and progenitor cell proliferation. Transcriptome analysis using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) showed 1) SPC expression of PPARs and RXRs able to mediate PFAS effects, 2) the emergence of a new cell cluster of aberrantly differentiated luminal progenitor cells upon PFOS/PFOA exposure, and 3) enrichment of cancer-associated signaling pathways. Metabolomic analysis of PFAS-exposed prostaspheres revealed increased glycolytic pathways including the Warburg effect as well as strong enrichment of serine and glycine metabolism which may promote a pre-malignant SPC fate. Finally, growth of in vivo xenografts of tumorigenic RWPE-2 human prostate cells, shown to contain cancer stem-like cells, was markedly enhanced by daily PFOS feeding to nude mice hosts. Together, these findings are the first to identify human prostate SPCs as direct PFAS targets with resultant reprogrammed transcriptomes and metabolomes that augment a preneoplastic state and may contribute to an elevated prostate cancer risk with chronic exposures. © 2021","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: G.S.

Methods: A recall-by-genotype study was implemented in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Samples from 756 participants were selected for untargeted metabolomics analysis based on low versus high genetic liability for higher BMI defined by a genetic risk score (GRS). Regression analyses were performed to investigate associations between BMI GRS group and relative abundance of 973 metabolites. Results: After correction for multiple testing, 29 metabolites were associated with BMI GRS group. Bilirubin was among the most strongly associated metabolites, with reduced levels measured in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.32, 95% CI: −0.46 to −0.18, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.005). This study observed associations between BMI GRS group and the levels of several potentially diet-related metabolites, including hippurate, which had lower mean abundance in individuals in the high-BMI GRS group (β = −0.29, 95% CI: −0.44 to −0.15, Benjamini-Hochberg adjusted p = 0.008). Conclusions: Together with existing literature, these results suggest that a genetic predisposition to higher BMI captures differences in metabolism leading to adiposity gain.

The use of insecticides has been one of the major tools in pest control. However, the development of insecticide resistance has been a major problem in the control of insect pest populations that threaten the health of both humans and plants. The overexpression of detoxification genes is thought to be one of the major mechanisms through which pests develop resistance to insecticides. Hundreds of research papers have explored how overexpressed detoxification genes increase the resistance status of insects to an insecticide in recent years. This study is, for the first time, a synthesis of these resistance and gene expression data aimed at (1) setting up an example for the application of meta-analysis in the investigation of the mechanisms of insecticide resistance and (2) seeking to determine if the overexpression detoxification genes are responsible for insecticide resistance in insect pests in general. A strong correlation of increased levels of insecticide resistance has been observed in tested insects with cytochrome P450 (CYP), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), and esterase gene superfamilies, confirming that the overexpression of detoxification genes is indeed involved in the insecticide resistance through the increased metabolism of insecticides of insects, including medically (e.g., mosquito and housefly) and agriculturally (e.g., planthopper and caterpillar) important insects.

OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA’s Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement–only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with ≥21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

The dependence of the parasite on the host hemoglobin could lead to increased disease severity in the host. In this study, molecular docking analyses were used to evaluate the binding interactions of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide analogues to P. falciparum falcilysin. The protein databank and the CheBI database were used to find P. falciparum falcilysin and the compounds, respectively. The protein and the collected compounds were imported into PyRx virtual screening software and the docking was initiated. Following that, Discovery Studio was utilized to virtualize the 2D and 3D interactions. The binding energies of 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4""-disulfonate and 4,7-diphenyl-1,10-phenanthroline 4',4""-disulfonic acid were both more than-10.0 kcal/mol among the phenanthroline analogues while only oleanolic acid and N-ethylsuccinimide-mycothiol conjugate from the dipicolinic acid and N-ethylmaleimide analogues had binding energies of-9.7 and-9.4 kcal/mol respectively. The higher binding energies were attributable to hydrogen bond interactions as well as other interactions between the chemicals and the amino acid residues of the falcilysin. The analogues were shown to be moderately safe in pharmacokinetic investigations and scaled Lipinski's rule of five (RO5). The findings of the study revealed that analogues of dipicolinic acid, phenanthroline, and N-ethylmaleimide could serve as potential inhibitors of P. falciparum falcilysin.

The current study aimed to provide an updated and comprehensive assessment of the association between SSRI use and development of HCC. Methods: This is a systematic review and meta-analysis of all observational studies published until June 2021. We comprehensively searched PubMed/Medline, Web of Science, and Embase to identify studies comparing SSRIs use with control in relation to the risk of HCC. We calculated pooled relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the association between SSRI use and incident HCC risk using random-effects meta-analysis. A dose–response analysis was conducted to evaluate the HCC risk according to the defined daily dose (DDD) of SSRI use. Results: Eight observational studies, comprising 1,051,096 participants and 22,316 incidences of HCC, examining the association between SSRIs use and HCC risk, were included in the systematic review (adjusted RR: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.56–0.79; P ≤ 0.001). In subgroup analysis, the magnitude of benefit associated with SSRIs was significantly higher in patients with hepatitis infection (RR: 0.70, 95% CI: 0.51–0.95) than the general population (Pheterogeneity = 0.700). The dose–response analysis indicated strong inverse association between cumulative DDD of SSRI and risk of HCC (coefficient: − 0.0030; P = 0.002; R2 = 0.78). Conclusions: The results of this review show that SSRI use was associated with a 34% lower risk of HCC, which tend to be dose dependent. Further prospective studies are warranted to confirm these observations across the spectrum of chronic liver disease and hepatitis infection. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: W.

However, associations between exposure to PFASs and the risk of breast cancer are controversial. We retrieved studies on the association between PFASs—perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluo-rononanoic acid (PFNA), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS)—and breast cancer risk in women from PubMed, Embase, and the Web of Science. The pooled odds ratios (ORs) or relative risks (RRs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were ex-tracted or calculated from provided data. Moreover, subgroup and metaregression analyses were performed to distinguish the potential sources of heterogeneity between studies. Lastly, eight orig-inal studies were included in the meta-analysis. PFOA and PFHxS were positively correlated with breast cancer risk, and the pooled ORs (and 95% CIs) were 1.32 (1.19 and 1.46) and 1.79 (1.51 and 2.11), respectively. PFNA was negatively correlated with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 0.76 (0.6 and 0.96), and PFOS was shown to have no correlation with breast cancer risk and the pooled OR (and 95% CIs) was 1.01 (0.87 and 1.17). All results were merged in a random-effects model with significant heterogeneities (I2 > 90%, p < 0.001).

However, the determination of the key toxicants that consider the combined effects of all sediment-related contaminants are still challenging and necessary for an appropriate sediment risk assessment. The effects of sediments on aquatic organisms have been reported in Liaohe River, but their key toxicity factors are not well known. To determine the key toxicity factors, twenty-six surface sediment samples from Liaohe River tributaries in Northeast China were collected. Acute toxicity test of midge larvae results showed that 6 of 26 tributaries had obvious toxic effects, with survival rates of 37%–57% (p < 0.05). The masking test showed that the main pollutants in the surface sediments of T7 and T16 were metals, that of T8 was an organic pollutant, those of T19 and T26 were organic pollutants and ammonia, and those of T17 were heavy metal and ammonia. Chemical analysis showed that the relatively high concentrations of ammonia were only presented in surface sediments of T17, T19, and T26, with PTU of 1.5, 1.2 and 1.1, respectively, whereas heavy metals were markedly high in surface sediments from T7 and T16, with PTU of 0.92 and 0.61, respectively. Interestingly, the observed toxicity in surface sediments agreed with the toxicity predicted by chemical analysis Moreover, the significant correlation between the survival and volume ratio of the sediment and overlying water confirmed ammonia nitrogen was key toxicity factor in T17, T19, and T26, whereas Cu was the key toxicity factor in T7 that cause the biological toxicity. In conclusion, the major toxic factors of ammonia and copper in the sediments were identified.

The key to disease prevention is to clarify the harmful mechanisms and toxic effects of environmental pollutants on the body. Metabolomics is a high-sensitivity, high-throughput omics technology that can obtain detailed metabolite information of an organism. It is a crucial tool for gaining a comprehensive understanding of the pathway network regulation mechanism of the organism. Its application is widespread in many research fields such as environmental exposure assessment, medicine, systems biology, and biomarker discovery. Aim of review: Recent findings show that metabolomics can be used to obtain molecular snapshots of organisms after environmental exposure, to help understand the interaction between environmental exposure and organisms, and to identify potential biomarkers and biological mechanisms.

Post-surgical imaging of mesh is useful when complications including mesh erosion, bleeding, and chronic pain arise. Different types of mesh coated with various materials have been developed to improve visibility on imaging studies. However, localization of surgical mesh after implantation remains challenging as visualization with standard imaging is difficult. The purpose of this study was to review the various radiologic approaches to characterizing synthetic surgical meshes. Recent Findings: A systematic and comprehensive literature search was performed by two independent reviewers using the PubMed database of the National Library of Medicine to identify all potentially relevant publications published before April 2020. Studies assessing the use of imaging for surgical mesh in both urogynecologic and non-urogyneocologic procedures were included. Iron impregnated mesh was most visible on imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT). Impregnated mesh was also shown to be more readily visible on ultrasound when compared to its non-iron containing counterpart. Non-impregnated expanded polytetrafluorethylene mesh (EPTF Mesh) was visible on CT and MRI. The more commonly used polypropylene and polyvinylidene mesh were more readily visualized on ultrasound although localization of surrounding structures remains difficult. Summary: Imaging surgical mesh poses an ongoing problem when complications arise. Although particle impregnated mesh is visible on CT and MRI, the adoption of this practice is still in its infancy. The ability to visualize EPTF mesh on CT and MRI is a promising advancement, but proper visualization of the more common synthetic meshes remains a limitation. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: B.

The Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the dominant bacteria at the phylum level, Flavobacteria was the dominant bacteria at the class level, and Flavobacterium was the dominant bacteria at the genus level. However, there were great differences in the bacterial community compositions of the four reservoirs. In Proteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria showed a higher relative abundance in MGW and BYW, and Alphaproteobacterial and Betaproteobacteria showed a higher relative abundance in AJW and KCW, respectively; Bacillus exhibited a higher relative abundance in AJW and MGW; other bacteria with higher abundance included Planomicrobium in AJW, Massilia in KCW, Acinetobacter and Planomicrobium in MGW, and Pseudomonas and Psychrobacter in BYW; in addition, some specific high- abundance classes and genera were found in AJW, among them, both Exiguobacterium and CL500-29_marine_group were conducive to maintaining the water quality and bacterial diversity. PICRUSt function prediction analysis indicated that the genes of the bacterial community in four reservoirs related to metabolism, genetic information processing, environmental information processing and cellular processes showed relatively a high abundance. In addition, some bacterial genes were related to the biodegradation of xenobiotic compounds, and the relative abundances of genes related to degradation of benzoate, aminobenzoate, chloroalkane and chloroalkene, and naphthalene were higher. In summary, the compositions of the bacterial community in different reservoirs were varied, which could be related to the water source, surrounding environment, and human activities. The presence of the genes related to the degradation of aromatic compounds and organochlorine compounds in the reservoirs could play a potential role in pollutant degradation and bioremediation. © 2022 Science Press.

We examined the extent to which variation in hospital antibiotic prescribing is associated with mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Methods: This ecological analysis examined Hospital Episode Statistics from 36,124,372 acute/general medicine admissions (≥16y) to 135 acute hospitals in England, 01/April/2010–31/March/2017. Random-effects meta-regression was used to investigate whether heterogeneity in adjusted 30-day mortality was associated with hospital-level antibiotic use, measured in defined-daily-doses (DDD)/1,000 bed-days. Models also considered DDDs/1,000 admissions and DDDs for narrow-spectrum/broad-spectrum antibiotics, parenteral/oral, and local interpretations of World Health Organization Access, Watch, and Reserve antibiotics. Results: Hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days varied 15-fold with comparable variation in broad-spectrum, parenteral, and Reserve antibiotic use. After extensive adjusting for hospital case-mix, the probability of 30-day mortality changed -0.010% (95% CI: -0.064,+0.044) for each increase of 500 hospital-level antibiotic DDDs/1,000 bed-days. Analyses of other metrics of antibiotic use showed no consistent association with mortality risk. Conclusions: We found no evidence that wide variation in hospital antibiotic use is associated with adjusted mortality risk in acute/general medicine inpatients. Using low-prescribing hospitals as benchmarks could help drive safe and substantial reductions in antibiotic consumption of up-to one-third in this population. © 2021","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: E.P.

However, investigations into the contamination of ARGs in mining areas have been scarce. Here, the types, abundances, and influencing factors of ARGs and mobile genetic elements (MGEs) were investigated in soil/sediment of the Dexing copper mine area in June 2019 by using high-throughput quantitative polymerase chain reaction (HT-qPCR). Furthermore, the influence of heavy metals and MGEs factors on ARGs was studied using the multivariate statistical analysis method. The results showed that there were a variety of ARGs in the Dexing copper mining area, and the maximum detected number of ARGs was 70. At the relative abundance level, the relative abundance of individual sites reached 0.085. In the Dexing copper mine, multidrug, MLSB, β-lactamases, tetracycline, and aminoglycoside resistance genes were the dominant ARG classes based on their numbers. The efflux pump was the most dominant resistance mechanism, followed by antibiotic deactivation and cellular protection. There was a significant positive correlation between the abundance of ARGs and MGEs (P<0.05), and TnpA04 and Inti1 were the most important MEGs in Dexing copper mine samples, indicating that horizontal gene transfer might be an important mechanism for the spread of environmental ARGs. The results of Pearson correlation analysis and RDA analysis showed that the content of Cu was significantly positively correlated with the detected numbers and abundance of ARGs (P<0.05), suggesting that the high content of Cu in the Dexing copper mining area might be an important driving factor for the formation of ARGs. © 2022, Science Press.

Henceforward, the present study reveals a novel bacterial species isolated from pesticide-contaminated soil for enhanced endosulfan degradation. Next, isolated bacterial species was characterized with biochemical assays and 16S rRNA sequencing technique. Subsequently, the optimal conditions for endosulfan biodegradation such as pH, concentration of endosulfan, and bacterial growth were estimated with non-sulfur medium (NSM). Sequentially, the amount of endosulfan and compound degradation were analyzed through thin-layer chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Overall, the obtained results revealed the endosulfan acting as primary carbon source for bacterial growth. From the GC-MS analysis, the metabolic products released during endosulfan degradation by Pseudomonas sp. MSCAS BT01 were compared with standard GC-MS spectra. The highest (98%) endosulfan degradation was obtained at pH 7.0. The complete endosulfan degradation was achieved at 14th day of incubation and the less toxic endosulfan diol produced was observed via GC-MS. To conclude, the pesticide-contaminated isolate Pseudomonas sp.

Legislation with aim to eliminate and ban EDs have been introduced in EU, but the identification of EDs remains challenging and crucial step towards regulation and risk management. A guidance for ED assessment has been recently established for pesticides and biocides in the EU, which heavily relies on traditional toxicological testing in vivo. Most notably lacking mechanistic methods for some ED modalities and not covering many other modalities that might be affected by EDs. In this project, we focus on the ED assessment according to the valid legislation and explore the possibility to employ alternative methods to bolster the mechanistic understanding of the ED effects and eventually decrease the need for in vivo testing. We selected a well-studied industrial chemical perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) to be a model compound in a case study for ED assessment where the EU criteria were applied in the frame of human health risk assessment with focus on thyroid disruption and developmental neurotoxicity. A systematic literature review has been conducted for these effects (Scopus, Pubmed, Embase), and relevant studies were selected by title/abstract screening (RAYYAN) and full-text examination. Selected studies were assessed for reliability (SciRAP), and all relevant data were extracted into a database and assessed by Weight of Evidence (WoE) approach. The initial analysis showed potential endocrine adverse effects and endocrine activity, meeting the ED criteria.

It was found that, compared to the worldwide average, Pakistan had high consumptions of pesticides, with an alarming increase of 1169% in the last two decades. The quantities of pesticides used followed an order of pyrethroids > organophosphates > organochlorines > carbamates, but organochlorines were the most problematic due to their environmental occurrence, the ability to transport across the media, and identified human and ecological toxicities. Additionally, the misuse or overuse of pesticides by farmers is prevailing due to insufficient knowledge about the risks, which leads to high risks in occupational exposure. These issues are further aggravated by the illegal use or continuous impacts of banned organochlorine pesticides. For the future, we suggested the establishment of organized monitoring, assessment, and reporting program based on environmental laws to minimize contamination and exposure to pesticides in Pakistan.

However, the molecular mechanism involved in low-level PFOA-induced male endocrine disruption remains to be elucidated. In this study, we performed a combined proteomics and metabolomics analysis to investigate the proteomic and metabolic alterations in MLTC-1 Leydig cells responsive to low levels of PFOA exposure. The results showed that PFOA significantly regulated the expressions of 67 proteins and 17 metabolites, among which 18 proteins and 7 metabolites were specifically tied to lipid and fatty acid metabolism as well as testicular steroidogenesis. It is further suggested that low-dose PFOA stimulates steroid hormone synthesis by accelerating fatty acid metabolism and steroidogenic process, which is involved in the repression of p38 and cAMP-dependent ERK signaling pathway. The animal studies also revealed that environmentally relevant levels of PFOA increased serum steroid hormone levels accompanied by the activated cAMP and inhibited p38/ERK pathway in testis, which confirmed our in vitro findings. Overall, the present study will provide novel insights into the toxicological mechanisms of low-level PFOA-mediated steroidogenic disturbance, and may implicate the reproductive health risk of humans with environmental PFOA exposure. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: Q.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis to compare outcomes of PFA and TKA by evaluation of the patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). Methods: We systematically identified publications reporting on patients that underwent either TKA or modern PFA for isolated PFOA. Meta-analysis software was used to screen for potential articles with at least two years’ follow-up. Data were extracted and analysed for all PROMs operating time, postoperative inpatient time, complications and cost. We included five studies in our cumulative meta-analysis and reviewed them using Review Manager V.5.0. We computed the risk ratio as a measure of the treatment effect, taking into account heterogeneity. We used random-effect models. Results: No significant difference was found between both TKA and PFA in the context of operating time. No significant difference after five years’ follow-up was found between the two treatment options in terms of UCLA score and patient satisfaction. PFA showed significant improvement in WOMAC score at five-year follow-up, less postoperative inpatient time, better cost-effectiveness and significantly less blood loss. Conclusion: PFA seems to be a viable alternative to TKA for treatment of isolated PFOA in appropriately selected patients. PFA showed less postoperative inpatient time and blood loss with similar PROMs to the TKA. Moreover, it is an economically beneficial joint-preserving procedure. © 2021, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: H.

Environmental effects on the immune system may influence human susceptibility to respiratory infections as well as the severity of infectious diseases, such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). Furthermore, the efficacy of vaccines to respiratory diseases may be impacted by environmental exposures through immune perturbations. Given the quick pace of research about COVID-19 and associated risk factors, it is critical to identify and curate the streams of evidence quickly and effectively. Objective: We developed this systematic evidence map protocol to identify and organize existing human and animal literature on high-priority environmental chemical classes (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, pesticides, phthalates, quaternary ammonium compounds, and air pollutants) and their potential to influence three key outcomes: (1) susceptibility to respiratory infection, including SARS-CoV-2 (2) severity of the resultant disease progression, and (3) impact on vaccine efficacy. The result of this project will be an online, interactive database which will show what evidence is currently available between involuntary exposures to select environmental chemicals and immune health effects, data gaps that require further research, and data rich areas that may support further analysis. Search and study eligibility: We will search PubMed for epidemiological or toxicological literature on select toxicants from each of the chemical classes and each of the three outcomes listed above. Study appraisal and synthesis of methods: For each study, two independent reviewers will conduct title and abstract screening as well as full text review for data extraction of study characteristics. Study quality will not be evaluated in this evidence mapping.

Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the epidemiological evidence on PFAS exposure and birth outcomes. Methods: Three electronic databases were searched for epidemiological studies through February 13, 2021. We used random-effects meta-analysis for eight birth outcome indicators to calculate summary effect estimates for various exposure types. The risk of bias and the overall quality and level of evidence for each exposure-outcome pair were assessed. Results: The initial search identified 58 potentially eligible studies, of which 46 were ultimately included. Many PFAS were found to have previously unrecognized statistically significant associations with birth outcomes. Specifically, birth weight (BW) was associated with PFAS, with effect sizes ranging from −181.209 g (95% confidence interval (CI) = −360.620 to −1.798) per 1 ng/ml increase in perfluoroheptanesulfonate (PFHpS) to −24.252 g (95% CI = −38.574 to −9.930) per 1 ln (ng/ml) increase in perfluorodecaoic acid (PFDA). Similar patterns were observed between other PFAS and birth outcomes: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) with birth length (BL) and ponderal index (PI), PFOS and perfluorododecanoic acid (PFDoDA) with head circumference (HC), PFHpS with gestational age (GA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) and PFHpS with preterm birth (PTB). Additionally, PFDA showed a statistically significant association with small for gestational age (SGA). The level of the combined evidence for each exposure-outcome pair was considered to be “moderate”. Conclusion: This study showed that PFAS exposure was significantly associated with increased risks of various adverse birth outcomes and that different birth outcome indicators had different degrees of sensitivity to PFAS. Further studies are needed to confirm our results by expanding the sample size, clarifying the effects of different types or doses of PFAS and the time of blood collection on birth outcomes, and fully considering the possible confounders.

Thus, the current study aimed to summarize and discuss the literature on the interactions and ecotoxicity of MP/NPs with pharmaceuticals in the aquatic environment. A scientometric and systematic review was conducted, and the data were summarized and discussed. The historical analysis indicated that the first article on the interactive effects between MP/NPs and pharmaceuticals was published in 2016. Scientific production is emerging in fourteen countries. Several types of MP/NPs (n = 13) and pharmaceuticals (n = 65) were studied, while the toxicity was evaluated in 30 articles (37.04 %). The interaction of MP/NPs with several pharmaceutical groups was confirmed, mainly antibiotics. In general, results confirmed the Trojan horse effects and indicated that MP/NPs changed the bioaccumulation and ecotoxicity of pharmaceuticals. The data reviewed demonstrated that future studies under environmentally relevant conditions are necessary for a better understanding of the mechanisms of action and toxicity of pharmaceuticals adsorbed to MP/NPs, especially mixtures with NPs.

A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate the associations between four types of EDCs (bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates (PAEs), organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)) and markers of inflammation and immune responses in humans. Three databases were searched, and 36 studies with a total of 22055 participants were included. The associations between EDCs and 26 inflammation-related acute phase proteins and cytokines were analyzed. The results demonstrated that exposure to BPA was positively associated with circulating levels of C-reactive protein (CRP) and interleukin (IL)-6. Exposure to PAEs was associated with elevated levels of CRP, IL-6 and IL-10. Subgroup analysis found that three PAE metabolites mono-benzyl phthalate (MBzP), mono-isobutyl phthalate (MiBP), and mono-n-butyl phthalate (MnBP) were directly associated with a higher level of CRP, and two other PAE metabolites mono-carboxyisononyl phthalate (MCNP) and mono-3-carboxypropyl phthalate (MCPP) were positively associated with IL-6. The positive associations between PAEs and CRP, IL-6 and IL-10 were significant in the high-molecular-weight phthalate (HMWP) exposure group, not the low-molecular-weight phthalate (LMWP) exposure group. Exposure to OCPs was positively associated with CRP, IL-1β, IL-2, and IL-10. No significant association was found between PCBs and inflammatory markers. These findings demonstrate that exposure to EDCs is closely linked to dysregulated inflammatory responses. More studies should be conducted in the future to get a comprehensive view of the associations between different EDCs and inflammation, and investigations on the underlying mechanisms are needed. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: X.

The adverse effects on biota induced by tris(2-chloroethyl) phosphate (TCEP) and triphenyl phosphate (TPHP) have become a growing concern. Unfortunately, toxic mechanisms at the molecular level for OPFRs in organisms are still lacking. Herein, Escherichia coli (E.coli) was exposed to TCEP and TPHP for 24 and 48 h to reveal oxidative stress response and molecular toxicity mechanisms. The results indicated that promotion of ROS overload occurred at higher dosages groups. The levels of SOD and CAT were significantly elevated along with the increase of MDA attributed to lipid peroxidation. Additionally, apoptosis rates increased, accompanied by a decline in membrane potential and Na+/K+-ATPase and Ca2+/Mg2+-ATPase contents, signifying that E. coli cytotoxicity induced by TCEP and TPHP was mediated by oxidative stress. Based on metabolomic analysis, different metabolic pathways were disrupted, including glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, pentose phosphate metabolism, purine metabolism, glutathione metabolism, amino acid biosynthesis, butanoate metabolism, alanine and aspartate metabolism. Most differentially expressed metabolites were downregulated, indicating an inhibitory effect on metabolic functions and key metabolic pathways.

Toxicity originates during the metabolization process, which may produce toxic metabolites or reactive oxygen species (ROS). Ethoxyresorufin-O-deethylase (EROD), glutathione S-transferase (GST), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD) activities, and levels of reduced glutathione (GSH) indicate toxicants interacted with drug-metabolizing and antioxidant systems, i.e., they are biomarkers of biotransformation and oxidative stress. We meta-analytically quantified the impact of pesticides on the mean response and variability of these biomarkers. Our goals were to verify (i) the overall effect of pesticides on oxidative stress and biotransformation, and how each biomarker respond to exposure; (ii) how the life stage of fish (juvenile and adult) influence biomarkers variability and mean activity; (iii) to what extent fish sex (male, female or mixed-sex groups) modify pesticides toxicity; (iv) how different classes of pesticides, and the combination of their concentration and time of exposure, affect each biomarker. Overall, pesticides induced oxidative stress and the biotransformation system. Regardless of life stage, EROD mean activity increased significantly. In exposed juveniles, CAT and GST variability decreased and increased, respectively. CAT mean activity was higher in females, while EROD and GST activities increased in males after pesticide exposure. Organophosphorus (OPs) and organochlorine insecticides, along with imidazole and triazole fungicides, affected biomarkers the most, however the combined effect of concentration and time of exposure of OPs was not detected. Notably, imidazoles and triazoles classes increased EROD by more than 100%. Additionally, we identified research gaps, such as the lack of effect estimates of relevant pesticides on EROD (e.g., pyrethroids and neonicotinoids) and the small number of studies evaluating GSH on female fish. Future researchers may use these gaps as a guide towards enhanced experimental designs and, consequently, a better understanding of pesticide toxic effects on fish. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 26; Correspondence Address: M.S.

However, information regarding its toxicity remains limited. Here, we established a three-dimensional (3D) primary mouse liver spheroid model to compare the hepatotoxicity of HFPO-TA and PFOA. The 3D spheroids were repeatedly exposed to 25-, 50-, or 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA for 28 d. Compared with the PFOA groups, the HFPO-TA groups showed higher bioaccumulation potential, higher lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage, and lower adenosine triphosphate (ATP), albumin, and urea secretion. Transcriptome analysis identified 1603 and 772 differentially expressed genes in the 100-μM HFPO-TA- and PFOA-treated groups, respectively. Bioinformatics analysis indicated that cholesterol metabolism, bile acid metabolism, and inflammatory response were significantly altered. Exposure to 100-μM HFPO-TA increased triglyceride content but decreased total cholesterol content, while no changes were observed in the 100-μM PFOA-treated group. Total bile acids in the re-polarized 3D spheroids increased significantly after 100-μM HFPO-TA and PFOA treatment, which did not affect bile acid synthesis but inhibited the expression levels of Bsep and Mrp2 related to bile acid transport. Thus, HFPO-TA exhibited more serious hepatotoxicity than PFOA in 3D primary liver spheroids and may not be a safe alternative. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: J.

It is a promising impurity adsorption material, which has potential application value in the agricultural environment fields such as soil improvement and sewage purification. The composite can combine the advantages of biochar with chitosan, and the resulting composite usually exhibits a great improvement in its surface functional groups, adsorption sites, stability, and adsorption properties. In addition, compared to other adsorbents, the composite truly achieves the concept of “waste control by waste”. In this paper, the preparation method, composite classification, adsorption mechanism, and models of biochar modified by chitosan are introduced, meanwhile, we also review and summarize their effects on the decontamination of wastewater and soil. In addition to common heavy metal ions, we also review the adsorption and removal of some other organic/inorganic pollutants, including (1) drug residues; (2) dyes; (3) phosphates; (4) radionuclides; (5) perfluorochemicals, etc. Moreover, challenges and prospects for the composite are presented and further studies are called for the chitosan-biochar composite.

The complete mineralisation of aqueous PFAS by ultrasound (sonolysis) into harmless inorganics has been demonstrated in many studies. However, the range and interconnected nature of reaction parameters (frequency, power, temperature etc.), and variety of reaction metrics used, limits understanding of degradation mechanisms and parametric trends. This work summarises the state-of-the-art for PFAS sonolysis, considering reaction mechanisms, kinetics, intermediates, products, rate limiting steps, reactant and product measurement techniques, and effects of co-contaminants. The meta-analysis showed that mid-high frequency (100 – 1,000 kHz) sonolysis mechanisms are similar, regardless of reaction conditions, while the low frequency (20 – 100 kHz) mechanisms are specific to oxidative species added, less well understood, and generally slower than mid-high frequency mechanisms. Arguments suggest that PFAS degradation occurs via adsorption (not absorption) at the bubble interface, followed by headgroup cleavage. Further mechanistic steps toward mineralisation remain to be proven. For the first time, complete stoichiometric reaction equations are derived for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) sonolysis, which add H2 as a reaction product and consider CO an intermediate. Fluorinated intermediate products are derived for common, and more novel PFAS, and a naming system proposed for novel perfluoroether carboxylates. The meta-analysis also revealed the transition between pseudo first and zero order PFOA/S kinetics commonly occurs at 15 – 40 µM. Optimum values of; ultrasonic frequency (300 – 500 kHz), concentration (>15 – 40 μM), temperature (≈20 °C), and pH range (3.2 – 4) for rapid PFOX degradation are derived by evaluation of prior works, while optimum values for the dilution factor applied to PFAS containing firefighting foams and applied power require further work. Rate limiting steps are debated and F− is shown to be rate enhancing, while SO42− and CO2 by products are theorised to be rate limiting. Sonolysis was compared to other PFAS destructive technologies and shown to be the only treatment which fully mineralises PFAS, degrades different PFAS in order of decreasing hydrophobicity, is parametrically well studied, and has low-moderate energy requirements (several kWh g−1 PFAS). It is concluded that sonolysis of PFAS in environmental samples would be well incorporated within a treatment train for improved efficiency. © 2022 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 22; Correspondence Address: M.J.

This systematic review study, using the Scopus da-tabase, provides an insightful understanding of the spatial distribution of scientific studies on MPs in freshwater conducted across the Asian region, utilized sampling methods, and a detailed assessment of the effects of MPs on different biotic components in freshwater ecosystems, with special focus on its potential risks on human health. The results of this review indicate that research on microplastics in Asia has gained attention since 2014, with a significant increase in the number of studies in 2018, and the number of scientific studies quadrupled in 2021 compared to 2018. Results indicated that despite a significant amount of research has been conducted in many Asian countries, they were not distributed evenly, as multiple studies selected specific rivers and lakes. Additionally, around two-thirds of all the papers focused their studies in China, followed by India and South Korea. It was also found that most of the studies focused primarily on reporting the occurrence levels of MPs in freshwater systems, such as water and sediments, and aquatic organisms, with a lack of studies investigating the human intake of MPs and their potential risks to human health. Notably, comparing the results is a challenge because diverse sampling, separation, and identification methods were applied to estimate MPs. This review study suggests that further research on the dynamics and transport of microplastics in biota and humans is needed, as Asia is a major consumer of seafood products and contributes significantly to the generation of plastic litter in the marine environment. Moreover, this review study revealed that only a few studies extended their discus-sions to policies and governance aspects of MPs.

Results showed exposure to HFPO-TA induced disadvantageous physiological changes in mice, including increases in liver weight, altered cell morphology, and inflammatory responses. Specifically, exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA increased mitochondria number, relative mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) content, and mRNA levels of mitochondrial genes encoded by mtDNA. Significant increases in TFAM mRNA and protein levels were also observed. Liver metabolome analysis also showed exposure to 200 μg/L HFPO-TA further enhanced increases in metabolites and altered metabolic pathways that correlated with mitochondrial function, especially the production of ATP. HFPO-TA exposure increased protein expression of mitochondrial complex I-V, and the activities of key enzymes involved in TCA cycle (α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase, citrate synthase, and succinate dehydrogenase).

We investigated whether exposure to DDT can exacerbate tau protein toxicity in Caenorhabditis elegans using a transgenic strain that expresses human tau protein prone to aggregation by measuring changes in size, swim behavior, respiration, lifespan, learning, and metabolism. In addition, we examined the association between cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) p-tau protein—as a marker of postmortem tau burden—and global metabolism in both a human population study and in C. elegans, using the same p-tau transgenic strain. From the human population study, plasma and CSFderived metabolic features associated with p-tau levels were related to drug, amino acid, fatty acid, and mitochondrial metabolism pathways. A total of five metabolites overlapped between plasma and C. elegans, and four between CSF and C. elegans. DDT exacerbated the inhibitory effect of p-tau protein on growth and basal respiration. In the presence of p-tau protein, DDT induced more curling and was associated with reduced levels of amino acids but increased levels of uric acid and adenosylselenohomocysteine. Our findings in C. elegans indicate that DDT exposure and p-tau aggregation both inhibit mitochondrial function and DDT exposure can exacerbate the mitochondrial inhibitory effects of p-tau aggregation. Further, biological pathways associated with exposure to DDT and p-tau protein appear to be conserved between species.  © The Author(s) 2022.

We comprehensively searched PubMed, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Studies comparing contemporary single- and dual-chamber ICD (VVI-/DDD-ICD) versus VDD-ICD were included. Restricted maximum likelihood method for random effect model and Mantel-Haenszel method for fixed effect model were used to estimate the effect size of new-onset AHREs, or SCAF detection in each group. Three prospective studies were identified and total of 991 participants were included. There were 330 (33.3%) in VDD-ICD and 661 (66.7%) in VVI-/DDD-ICD. Most (78%) participants were men. Median follow-up was from 365 days to 847 days. VDD-ICD has a higher likelihood of detecting AHREs or SCAF as compared to VVI-/DDD-ICD [(OR random effect : 2.6; 95% CI: 1.2, 5.8; p =.018); I-squared = 67.8%, p =.019]. This difference was more apparently seen in the comparison between VDD-ICD and VVI-ICD [(OR random effect: 3.8; 95% CI: 2.1, 6.6, p <.001), I-squared = 0.0%, p =.518]. The result is same as fixed effect. Rate of AHREs detection observed in VDD-ICD was not statistically different when compared to the only group with DDD-ICD from SENSE trial. In conclusion, this meta-analysis reveals that the use of floating atrial sensing dipole in VDD-ICD increases the detection of new-onset AHREs or SCAF when compared to VVI-ICD, with similar atrial sensing performance to DDD-ICD. © 2022 The Authors.

Reperfusion may be a necessary condition for positive effects of neuroprotective treatments. This systematic review provides an overview of efficacy of neuroprotective agents in combination with reperfusion therapy in AIS. Methods: A literature search was performed on the following databases, namely PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Emcare. All databases were searched up to September 23rd 2021. All randomized controlled trials in which patients were treated with neuroprotective strategies within 12 h of stroke onset in combination with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT), endovascular therapy (EVT), or both were included. Results: We screened 1,764 titles/abstracts and included 30 full reports of unique studies with a total of 16,160 patients. In 15 studies neuroprotectants were tested for clinical efficacy, where all patients had to receive reperfusion therapies, either IVT and/or EVT. Heterogeneity in reported outcome measures was observed. Treatment was associated with improved clinical outcome for: 1) uric acid in patients treated with EVT and IVT, 2) nerinetide in patients who underwent EVT without IVT, 3) imatinib in stroke patients treated with IVT with or without EVT, 4) remote ischemic perconditioning and IVT, and 5) high-flow normobaric oxygen treatment after EVT, with or without IVT. Conclusion: Studies specifically testing effects of neuroprotective agents in addition to IVT and/or EVT are scarce. Future neuroprotection studies should report standardized functional outcome measures and combine neuroprotective agents with reperfusion therapies in AIS or aim to include prespecified subgroup analyses for treatment with IVT and/or EVT.

Significant progress has been made to cure these infections, such as discovering antiparasitic drugs, developing new formulation strategies, site-directed drug delivery, chemotherapy, etc. Synthetic drugs are peri-lous and have various side effects, leading to the development of drug resistance and loss of health. Herbal medicines are economical and generally free from potential side effects; therefore, they are acclaiming recognition. However, it is difficult to produce antiparasitic vaccines; major efforts have been made and still, there are no licensed vaccines currently available to control human parasitic ailments. This systematic review assesses various techniques for the treatment of parasitic infections. Moreover, the advancements and challenges involved in establishing novel trends in the development of more effective drug delivery systems are also investigated. Over the years, the inci-dences of several infectious ailments in humans have enhanced and it is estimated to further increase in the future. Over thirty new infective agents have been identified globally in the last 30 years; approximately 60 % of them are from zoonotic sources. Efficient drug delivery plays a key role in treating parasitic infections. The main goal of the modern antiparasitic drug delivery system is to minimize the potential side effects and deliver the drug directly to the target pathogens. There-fore, more sophisticated drug formulations than a simple tablet or solution are necessary for the treatment of many human parasitic diseases. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: S.

Objective: To evaluate associations of prenatal organochlorine and metal exposures, considered individually and as a mixture, with mid-childhood and adolescent internalizing symptoms. Methods: Participants were 468 children from a prospective cohort recruited at birth (1993–1998) in New Bedford, Massachusetts. Organochlorines (hexachlorobenzene, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyl dichloroethylene, polychlorinated biphenyls) and metals (lead, manganese) were analyzed in cord blood. Internalizing symptoms (anxiety, depressive, somatic) were assessed via multiple informants on the Conners' Rating Scale (CRS) at 8-years and Behavior Assessment System for Children, Second Edition (BASC-2) at 15-years; higher T-scores indicate greater symptoms. Overall and sex-specific covariate-adjusted associations were evaluated using Bayesian Kernel Machine Regression (BKMR) and five-chemical linear regression models. Results: The cohort was socioeconomically diverse (35% household income <$20,000; 55% maternal ≤ high school education at birth). Most chemical concentrations were consistent with background levels [e.g., median (range) cord blood lead: 1.1 (0–9.4) μg/dL]. BKMR suggested linear associations and no interactions between chemicals. The overall mixture was positively associated with Conners’ Parent Rating Scale (CPRS) and BASC-2 Self Report of Personality (SRP) anxiety and depressive symptoms, and negatively with somatic symptoms. Prenatal lead was positively associated with adolescent anxiety symptoms [1.56 (95% CI: 0.50, 2.61) BASC-2 SRP Anxiety score increase per doubling lead]. For CRPS and BASC-2 SRP, a doubling of cord blood manganese was positively associated with internalizing symptoms for girls [e.g., 3.26 (95% CI: 0.27, 6.25) BASC-2 SRP Depression score increase], but not boys. Organochlorine exposures were not adversely associated with internalizing symptoms. Discussion: Low-level prenatal lead exposure was positively associated with adolescent anxiety symptoms, and prenatal manganese exposure was positively associated with internalizing symptoms for girls from mid-childhood through adolescence.

There is information indicating other sources and pathways of exposure in residential environments, but few studies report relationships between these indoor media and human biomonitoring measurements. Methods: This study adapts existing systematic review tools and methodologies to synthesize evidence for PFAS exposure pathways from indoor environment media including consumer products, household articles, cleaning products, personal care products, and indoor air and dust. Studies were identified using innovative machine learning approaches and pathway-specific search strings to reduce time needed for literature search and screening. The included studies and systematic review were evaluated using tools modified specifically for exposure studies. The systematic review was conducted following a previously published protocol (DeLuca et al., 2021) that describes the systematic review methodology used in detail. Results: Only 7 studies were identified that measured the targeted subset of 8 PFAS chemicals in concordant household media (primarily house dust) and participant serum. Data extracted from the included studies were used to calculate exposure intake rates and estimate a percentage of occupant serum concentrations that could be attributed to the indoor exposure pathways. These calculations showed that exposure to PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS from contaminated house dust could account for 13%, 3%, 7%, and 25% of serum concentrations, respectively. Inhalation of PFAS in indoor air could account for less than 4% of serum PFOA concentrations and less than 2% of serum PFOS and PFNA concentrations. A risk of bias was identified due to participant profiles in most of the studies being skewed towards white, female, and higher socioeconomic status. Conclusions: Along with synthesizing evidence for estimated contributions to serum PFAS levels from indoor exposure media, this systematic review also identifies a consistent risk of bias across exposure study populations that should be considered in future studies. It highlights a major research gap and need for studies that measure concordant data from both indoor exposure media and participant serum and the need for continued research on exposure modeling parameters for many PFAS chemicals. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 28; Correspondence Address: N.M.

PFAS exposure in people can have detrimental health consequences. Therefore, reducing PFAS burdens in food items is of great importance to public health. Here, we investigated whether cooking reduces PFAS concentrations in animal-derived food products by synthesizing experimental studies. Further, we examined the moderating effects of the following five variables: cooking time, liquid/animal tissue ratio, cooking temperature, carbon chain length of PFAS and the cooking category (oil-based, water-based & no-liquid cooking). In our systematic review searches, we obtained 512 effect sizes (relative differences in PFAS concentration between raw and cooked samples) from 10 relevant studies. These studies exclusively explored changes in PFAS concentrations in cooked seafood and freshwater fish. Our multilevel-meta-analysis has revealed that, on average, cooking reduced PFAS concentrations by 29%, although heterogeneity among effect sizes was very high (I2 = 94.65%). Our five moderators cumulatively explained 49% of the observed heterogeneity. Specifically, an increase in cooking time and liquid/animal tissue ratio, as well as shorter carbon chain length of PFAS (when cooked with oil) were associated with significant reductions in PFAS concentrations. The effects of different ways of cooking depended on the other moderators, while the effect of cooking temperature itself was not significant. Overall, cooking can reduce PFAS concentrations in blue food (seafood and freshwater fish). However, it is important to note that complete PFAS elimination requires unrealistically long cooking times and large liquid/animal tissue ratios. Currently, literature on the impact of cooking of terrestrial animal produce on PFAS concentrations is lacking, which limits the inference and generalisation of our meta-analysis. However, our work represents the first step towards developing guidelines to reduce PFAS in food via cooking exclusively with common kitchen items and techniques. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 6; Correspondence Address: C.

These enzymes have a broad substrate range and a robust oxidizing ability. Moreover, using mediators or co-oxidants makes it possible to increase their catalytic activity and extend their substrate scope to more resistant chemical structures. Background: Fungal laccases and ligninolytic peroxidases, mainly lignin and manganese peroxidases, are the privileged oxidoreductases for bioremediation processes. Nonetheless, an increasing diversity of laccases and peroxidase-type enzymes has been proposed for environmental technologies. Objective: This article aims to provide an overview of these enzymes and compare their applicability in the degradation of organic pollutants. Methods: Fundamental properties of the proteins are covered and applications towards polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and pesticides are specially focused. Results: Laccases are multicopper oxidases initially studied for applications in the pulp and paper in-dustry but able to oxidize a variety of environmentally concerning compounds. Relying on O2, laccases do not require peroxides nor auxiliary agents, like Mn2+, although suitable redox mediators are needed to attack the more recalcitrant pollutants (e.g., PAHs). True and pseudo-peroxidases use a stronger oxi-dant (H2O2) and the redox chemistry at the heme site generates high potential species that allow the oxidation of dyes and some pesticides. Conclusion: Lately, research efforts have been directed to enzyme discovery, testing with micropollu-tants, and improving biocatalysts’ stability by immobilization and protein engineering. Further under-standing of the effects of natural media components and solvents on the enzymes might lead to compet-itive enzymatic treatments of highly toxic media. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 4; Correspondence Address: R.L.

Methods: The Smith & Nephew InterTan IDL was compared with SL CMN group consisting of the Stryker Gamma-3 (G3) and Synthes Proximal Femoral Nail Antirotation (PFNA) CMN. A multi-database search was performed according to PRISMA guidelines. Data from studies assessing the clinical and radiological outcomes, complications and perioperative parameters of InterTan versus G3 or PFNA CMN in patients with intertrochanteric femoral fractures were extracted and analysed. Results: 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, consisting of 2643 patients. InterTan was associated with lower complication rates in terms of all-cause revisions (OR 0.34; 95% CI, 0.22–0.51; p < 0.001), cut-outs (OR 0.30; 95% CI, 0.17–0.51; p < 0.001), medial or lateral screw migration (OR 0.19; 95% CI, 0.06–0.65; p = 0.008) as well as persistent hip and thigh pain (OR 0.65; 95% CI, 0.47–0.90; p = 0.008). In terms of perioperative parameters, InterTan is associated with longer operative times (MD 5.57 minutes; 95% CI, 0.37–10.78 minutes, p = 0.04) and fluoroscopy times (MD 38.89 seconds, 95% CI, 15.88–61.91 seconds; p < 0.001). There was no statistically significant difference in terms of clinical Harris Hip Score and radiological outcomes, non-union, haematoma, femoral fractures, varus collapse, length of stay and mean intraoperative blood loss between the 2 groups. Conclusions: Integrated dual lag screw cephalomedullary nails are associated with fewer revisions and complications.

The acquired DDE may occur as a result of a wide range of acquired etiological factors and his prevalence of this pathology may reach up to 89.9%. The main objective of this research was to identify and analyze, in current literature, the factors related to acquired DDE, in order to propose a general theory about the mechanisms involved. Methods: The search of the primary literature was conducted until [December 31, 2021]. Our search strategy uses the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and was structured around 3 terms [“Development,” “Defect,” and “Enamel”]. To be included, references had to be primary studies, written in English. Exclusion criteria were reviews, in vitro, animal, genetic or archeology studies, and studies focused on clinical management of DDE. One hundred and twenty three articles were included in this scoping review: 4 Randomized clinical trials, 1 letter, 5 cases reports, 2 fundamentals studies, and 111 observational studies (33 Cross-sectional studies, 68 Cohort study and 10 Case-control study). The quality of evidence was assessed using the PEDro scale for clinical trials, the Newcastle-Ottawa scale for observational studies, and a published tool to assess the quality of case reports and case series. Results: A scoping review of the literature identified 114 factors potentially involved in acquired DDE. The most frequently encountered pathologies are those causing a disorder of calcium homeostasis or a perturbation of the ARNT pathway in mother or child. The link between the ARNT pathway and metabolism deficiency in uncertain and needs to be defined. Also, the implication of this mechanism in tissue impairment is still unclear and needs to be explored. Conclusions: By identifying and grouping the risk factors cited in the literature, this taxonomy and the hypotheses related to the mechanism allow health practitioners to adopt behaviors that limit the risk of developing aDDE and to set up a prevention of dental pathology. In addition, by reviewing the current literature, this work provides guidance for basic research, clinical studies, and literature searches.

Plastics have become part of our daily life due to their many applications and uses. However, inappropriately managed plastic waste has raised concern regarding their ecotoxicological and human health risks in the long term. Due to the non-biodegradable nature of plastics, their waste may take several thousands of years to partially degrade in natural environments. Plastic fragments/particles can be very minute in size and are mistaken easily for prey or food by aquatic organisms (e.g., invertebrates, fishes). The surface properties of plastic particles, including large surface area, functional groups, surface topography, point zero charge, influence the sorption of various contaminants, including heavy metals, oil spills, PAHs, PCBs and DDT. Despite the fact that the number of studies on the biological effects of plastic particles on biota and humans has been increasing in recent years, studies on mixtures of plastics and other chemical contaminants in the aquatic environment are still limited. This review aims to gather information about the main characteristics of plastic particles that allow different types of contaminants to adsorb on their surfaces, the consequences of this adsorption, and the interactions of plastic particles with aquatic biota. Additionally, some missing links and potential solutions are presented to boost more research on this topic and achieve a holistic view on the effects of micro-and nanoplastics to biological systems in aquatic environments. It is urgent to implement measures to deal with plastic pollution that include improving waste management, monitoring key plastic particles, their hotspots, and developing their assessment techniques, using alternative products, determining concentrations of micro-and nanoplastics and the contaminants in freshwater and marine food-species consumed by humans, applying clean-up and remediation strategies, and biodegradation strategies. © 2022 by the authors.

These agents include air, gas (sulfur hexafluoride [SF6], hexafluoroethane [C2F6], and perfluoropropane [C3F8]), and silicone oil. The optimal tamponade agent is uncertain, and we aimed to review the effect of tamponade choice on hole closure and visual outcomes. Clinical relevance: Although most surgeons initially chose to use long-acting gas (C3F8), there has been a gradual change in practice to the increasing use of the medium- (C2F6) and short-acting gases (SF6) or even air. However, there is no consensus regarding their relative efficacies. Methods: Systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and prospective and retrospective comparative cohort studies comparing different tamponade agents in patients undergoing vitrectomy and ILM peeling for primary idiopathic macular holes. For RCTs, the risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool for RCTs, whereas for nonrandomized studies, the Risk of Bias in Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions tool was used. Results: Thirteen publications, including 2 RCTs, were identified. Overall, there was no significant difference in the anatomic closure rates between studies using SF6 compared with either C3F8 or C2F6 (odds ratio [OR] = 0.74; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.51–1.08). A subgroup analysis showed a significantly higher closure rate using SF6 (OR = 0.49; 95% CI = 0.30–0.79) in patients without postoperative posturing but not in those who were advised to posture facedown. The visual outcomes and adverse events were not significantly different. The comparisons of anatomic closure rates of patients treated with gas tamponade vs. silicone oil and with air vs. SF6 showed no significant differences. The included studies had a number of methodological limitations and heterogeneities, making conclusions imprecise, with low or very low certainty by the Grades of Recommendation, Assessment, Development and Evaluation approach. Conclusion: The current evidence base for tamponade selection with vitrectomy and ILM peeling for full-thickness macular hole has several major limitations. Further appropriately designed studies are needed to guide tamponade selection. © 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 10; Correspondence Address: D.H.

However, traditional assessment heavily relies on laboratory bioassays, which may cause uncertainty due to inevitable laboratory-related artifact. A self-designed in-situ bioassay system was successfully applied to simultaneously evaluate water and sediment toxicity by co-exposure of two native species, Chinese rare minnows (Gobiocypris rarus) and Asian clams (Corbicula fluminea) in Tai Lake Basin, China. In-situ exposure caused pronouncedly lethal and sublethal effects (i.e., metabolic and oxidative stress, neurotoxicity, reproductive toxicity) on both fish and clams. Meanwhile, multi-media distribution of organic contaminants in water-sediment-biota system was analyzed. Besides hydrophobicity, metabolism was recognized as an influential factor on phase distribution of contaminants in water-fish and sediment-clam systems. Traditional hazard quotient (HQ) method based on environmental concentrations of 98 contaminants showed bias in risk assessment. Instead, a weight of evidence method by integrating three lines of evidence, including in-situ survival, enhanced integrated biomarker response values and environmental concentrations, successfully differentiate high- and moderate-risk sites in the shallow lakes.

This highlights the need for understanding the impact of such application on the reservoir of antibiotic resistance genes in poultry gut and devising means to circumvent the potential resistome expansion. Phytogenic feed additives (PFAs) are potential natural alternative to antibiotic to improve animal health and performance, supposedly via positively affecting the gut microbial ecosystem, but there is little systematic information available. In this time-course study, we applied a shotgun meta-transcriptomics approach to investigate the impact of a PFA product as well as the commonly used antibiotic, zinc bacitracin either at AGP concentration or therapeutic concentration on the gut microbiome and resistome of broiler chickens raised for 35 days. Over the course of the trial, PFA treatments increased the abundance of Firmicutes such as Lactobacillus and resulted in a lower abundance of Escherichia, while the latter group increased significantly in the feces of chickens that received either AGP or AB doses of bacitracin. Tetracycline resistance and aminoglycoside resistance were the predominant antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) classes found, regardless of the treatment. PFA application resulted in a decrease in abundance of ARGs compared to those in the control group and other antibiotic treatment groups. In summary, the findings from this study demonstrate the potential of phytogenic feed additives could be an alternative to antibiotics in poultry farming, with the added benefit of counteracting antimicrobial resistance development.

However, they are usually coated with hazardous substances, such as per- and polyfluorinated alkyl substances (PFASs). PFASs, with its functional properties of oil- and water-repellency, can migrate from FCMs into the food and cause potential risk to human health. There are also increasing concerns about the harm that FCMs can cause to the environment. These concerns include accumulation of non-degradable plastics in the environment, generation of microplastics (MPs) and nanoplastics, and release of PFASs from FCMs. While many reviews have been conducted on PFASs in the environment, including their occurrence, fate, toxicity, biodegradation, migration in ecosystems and remediation technologies, a systematic review of PFASs in FCMs and MPs is currently lacking. In addition, our knowledge of the PFAS sorption processes on MPs is rather limited, and in particular their desorption processes. Thus, this review aims to (1) review the presence of various classes of PFASs in FCMs and their migration into food, (2) review the PFASs in MPs and summarize the sorption mechanisms, and factors that influence their sorption behaviour on MPs in the aquatic environment, and (3) identify the current research gaps and future research directions to predict the risks associated with the presence and sorption of PFASs in FCMs and MPs. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 29; Correspondence Address: B.

The sample MGB-3 was richer in macronutrients (C, N, P), supporting high microbial diversity than MGB-2. The presence of reads for biphenyl degradation, dioxin degradation, PAH degradation pathways can be further correlated with the presence of PCB and PAH as detected in the MGB-2 and MGB-3 samples. Further, taxonomic vis-à-vis functional analysis identified Burkholderia, Bradyrhizobium, Mycobacterium, and Rhodopseudomonas as the keystone degrader of PAH and PCB.

Many vertebrate species feed on crops, which has caused an increase in human-wildlife conflicts in croplands. Crop-feeding damages the economy of local communities and causes retaliation against the responsible vertebrates in several forms, including lethal practices such as hunting and poisoning. Lethal control may cause the local extirpation of some species, affecting ecological processes and patterns. Therefore, it is necessary to find non-lethal alternatives that can protect both local economies and wildlife. Research has been conducted in Africa and Asia, focusing on elephants and primates, and the effectiveness of some non-lethal alternatives, such as chili-based repellents and beehives, is being investigated. However, there has been very little research on this topic in Central and South America. The goal of this review is to assess the current knowledge on crop damage by vertebrates in Central and South America and indicate future research directions. Survey methodology: We reviewed the available scientific literature reporting crop damage by vertebrates in Central and South America, and the Caribbean, published between 1980 and 2020, through systematic searches on Web of Science, Scopus, and Google Scholar. We analyzed the temporal and geographical distributions of the studies, the crops and vertebrate species these studies considered, the crop protection techniques used, and their effectiveness. Results: We retrieved only 113 studies on crop damage by vertebrates in Latin America, but there was an increasing trend in the number of studies published over time. Most of the studies were conducted in Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, and Costa Rica. Four orders of mammals (Rodentia, Carnivora, Artiodactyla, and Primates) and four orders of birds (Passeriformes, Columbiformes, Psittaciformes, and Anseriformes) were the most common groups of crop-feeding vertebrates. The most prominent crop was corn, which was featured in 49% of the studies. Other notable crops include rice, sorghum, and sugarcane. The most reported method for protecting crops was lethal control through hunting or poisoning. Non-lethal techniques were found to be less prevalent. Less than half of the studies that mentioned the use of protection techniques indicated their effectiveness, and only 10 studies evaluated it by performing scientific experiments and reporting their results. Conclusions: Central and South America is still underrepresented in research on vertebrate crop-feeding. There is a need for experimentation-based robust research to find crop protection techniques that minimize harm to vertebrates while effectively reducing damage to crops. While this is being studied, habitat loss and fragmentation need to be halted to prevent the native vertebrates from turning to crops for food.

Tons and tons of wastewater with hazardous pollutants are getting discharged into the clean water bodies every day. In this regard, photocatalytic environmental remediation using nanotechnology such as the use of organic, metal and non-metal based semiconductor photocatalysts for photodegradation of pollutants has gained enormous attention in the past few decades. This review is focused particularly on graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) which is a cheap, metal-free, polymeric photoactive compound and it is used as a potential photocatalyst in wastewater treatment. Though, pristine g-C3N4 is a good photocatalyst, it has certain drawbacks such as poor visible light absorption capacity, quicker recombination of photoelectrons and holes, delayed mass and charge transfer, etc. As a result, the pristine g-C3N4 catalyst is modified into novel 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D morphologies such as nano-quantum dots, nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires, nanosheets, nanoflakes, nanospheres, nanoshells, etc. It was also tailored into novel composites along with various compounds through doping, metal deposition, heterojunction formation, etc., to enhance the photocatalytic property of pure g-C3N4. The modified catalysts showed promising photocatalytic performance such as degradation of majority of pollutants in the environment. It also showed excellent results in the removal or reduction of heavy metals. This review provides a detailed record of g-C3N4 and its diverse photocatalytic applications in the past years and it provides knowledge for the development of such similar novel compounds in the future. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 69; Correspondence Address: S.

Modification of maternal metabolism by environmental exposure may be an important pathway for these impacts. However, there is limited evidence regarding exposure to a wide array of chemicals and the metabolome during pregnancy. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the relationship between the urinary exposome and metabolome during pregnancy. METHODS: Urine samples were collected in the first and third trimesters from 1,024 pregnant women recruited in prenatal clinics in Jiangsu Province, China. The exposome was analyzed using the first trimester sample with ultra-high performance liquid chromatography–high resolution accurate mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS) and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The metabolome was analyzed using the third trimester sample with UHPLC-HRMS. We evaluated associations between each of 106 exposures in the first trimester with 139 metabolites in the third trimester. RESULTS: We identified 1,245 significant associations (p < 3:39 × 10−6, Bonferroni correction) between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Among elements, the largest number of the significant metabolic associations were observed for magnesium, and among organic compounds, for 4-tert-octylphenol. We used exposome–metabolome associations to explore mechanisms underlying published associations between prenatal chemical exposures and offspring health outcomes. This integration of the literature with our results suggests that reported associations between 10 analytes and birth weight, gestational age, fat deposition, neurobehavioral development, immunological disorders, and hypertension may be partially mediated by metabolites associated with these exposures. DISCUSSION: This high-dimensional analysis of the urinary exposome and metabolome identified many associations between chemical exposures and maternal metabolism during pregnancy. Integration of these associations with the literature on health outcomes of exposure suggests that environmental modulation of the maternal metabolome may play a role in the association between prenatal exposure on pregnancy and child health outcomes. © 2022, Public Health Services, US Dept of Health and Human Services.

However, the effects of moderate exposure to POPs on task-based inhibitory control performance, related brain function, and ADHD-related symptoms remain unknown, limiting our ability to develop interventions targeting the neural impact of common levels of exposure. Objectives: The goal of this study was to examine the association between prenatal POP exposure and inhibitory control performance, neural correlates of inhibitory control and ADHD-related symptoms. Methods: Prospective data was gathered in an observational study of Canadian mother-child dyads, with moderate exposure to POPs, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), as part of the GESTation and the Environment (GESTE) cohort in Sherbrooke, Quebec, Canada. The sample included 87 eligible children, 46 with maternal plasma samples, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of Simon task performance at 9–11 years, and parental report of clinical symptoms via the Behavioral Assessment System for Children 3 (BASC-3). Simon task performance was probed via drift diffusion modeling, and parameter estimates were related to POP exposure. Simon task-based fMRI data was modeled to examine the difference in incongruent vs congruent trials in regions of interest (ROIs) identified by meta analysis. Results: Of the 46 participants with complete data, 29 were male, and mean age was 10.42 ± 0.55 years. Increased POP exposure was associated with reduced accuracy (e.g. PCB molar sum rate ratio = 0.95; 95% CI [0.90, 0.99]), drift rate (e.g. for PCB molar sum β = −0.42; 95% CI [-0.77, −0.07]), and task-related brain activity (e.g. in inferior frontal cortex for PCB molar sum β = −0.35; 95% CI [-0.69, −0.02]), and increased ADHD symptoms (e.g. hyperactivity PCB molar sum β = 2.35; 95%CI [0.17, 4.53]), supporting the possibility that prenatal exposure to POPs is a modifiable risk for ADHD phenotypes. Discussion: We showed that exposure to POPs is related to task-based changes in neural activity in brain regions important for inhibitory control, suggesting a biological mechanism underlying previously documented associations between POPs and neurobehavioral deficits found in ADHD phenotypes. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: L.

The main insecticides for controlling N. lugens belong to organochlorine, organophosphorus, carbamate, neonicotinoid and pyrethroid groups. However, metabolic enzymes, including cytochrome P450s, esterases, glutathione-S-transferases, and ATP-binding cassette transporters, effectively promote the detoxification of insecticides. Besides, mutations of neurological target sites, such as acetylcholinesterase, nicotinic acetylcholine, γ-aminobutyric acid receptor, and ryanodine receptor, result in insensitivity to insecticides.

Global exposure to perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS) was the highest, followed by perfluorohexanesulfonic acid (PFHxS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA). Spatiotemporal exposure to PFAS varied considerably, with daily intake estimated in the range of 0.01-1.7 ng/kg/day. Moreover, decreasing trends in PFOS, PFHxS, and PFOA exposure were noted in most regions of the world over the past two decades, but such trends were not observed for other PFAS with long carbon chains, especially in East Asia.

This paper provides a systematic review of the research advances in the novel environmentally friendly suppressant, C6F12O. Considering the principle of screening fire suppressants, the physical and chemical properties of C6F12O are presented first. Specifically, research on the measurement of the thermodynamic parameters, toxicity, corrosion, environmental compatibility and dispersion characteristics are summarized, revealing that the poor dispersibility, corrosion of the hydrolysates (perfluoropropionic acid), corrosion and toxicity of thermal breakdown products such as HF and COF2 and environmentally unfriendly products such as perfluorocarbons should be paid more attention. Three main synthesis routes of C6F12O are also introduced in view of its promising prospects for application. Furthermore, the fire extinguishing efficiency of C6F12O has been fully investigated in both a laboratory burner scale and full-scale fire extinguishing experiment, the results of which show that the minimum extinguishing volume concentration of C6F12O is lower than HFCs, but the mass concentration is much higher. Although C6F12O has shown satisfactory fire extinguishing performance in various fire protection scenarios, fire enhancement phenomenon and the large production of HF have been observed during fire extinguishment. Finally, the fire extinguishing mechanism of C6F12O has been discussed. The flame suppression effect of C6F12O, combustion enhancement phenomenon and the influence of water in the reaction zone have been revealed. This review fully evaluates C6F12O, in hope that it will provide a reference for follow-up research and the development of a halon replacement. © 2022 by the authors.

PFAS concentrations were compiled for WWTPs in the United States from peer-reviewed studies, technical reports, and original data. Perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) increased by an average of 6.0 ± 1.6 ng/L from the influents to the effluents of WWTPs, but perfluorosulfonic acid (PFOS) did not significantly change, indicating sorption to sludge is offset by biotransformation of precursor compounds. The occurrence of individual PFAS may vary temporally; for example, perfluoropentanoic acid correlated weakly with seasonal temperatures at a site in Virginia. Wastewater effluent PFOA concentrations decreased at a site in Nevada from 2012 to February 2020 but appeared to increase during the COVID-19 pandemic. Effluent PFOA also declined nationally from 1999 to 2020 by ∼13% per year. Nevertheless, the national mean PFOA concentration was 8.4 ± 0.4 ng/L in data collected from 2013 to 2020 with outliers omitted, indicating persisting low-level occurrence. This would equate to 383 ± 20 kg of PFOA per year continuing to enter the environment via WWTP effluents. © 2022 American Chemical Society.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 41; Correspondence Address: K.A.

S2-17, which could completely degrade an emerging organic pollutant, benzophenone-3 (BP-3), was isolated from contaminated sediment through an enrichment procedure, and its BP-3 catabolic pathway and genes were identified through metabolic intermediate and transcriptomic analyses and biochemical and genetic studies. Metabolic intermediate analysis suggested that strain S2-17 may degrade BP-3 using a catabolic pathway progressing via the intermediates BP-1, 2,4,5-trihydroxy-benzophenone, 3-hydroxy-4-benzoyl-2,4-hexadienedioic acid, 4-benzoyl-3-oxoadipic acid, 3-oxoadipic acid, and benzoic acid. A putative BP-3 catabolic gene cluster including cytochrome P450, flavin-dependent oxidoreductase, hydroxyquinol 1,2-dioxygenase, maleylacetate reductase, and α/β hydrolase genes was identified through genomic and transcriptomic analyses. Genes encoding the cytochrome P450 complex that demethylates BP-3 to BP-1 were functionally verified through protein expression, and the functions of the other genes were also verified through knockout mutant construction and intermediate analysis. This study suggested that strain S2-17 might have acquired the ability to catabolize BP-3 by recruiting the cytochrome P450 complex and α/β hydrolase, which hydrolyzes 4-benzoyl-3-oxoadipic acid to benzoic acid and 3-oxoadipic acid, genes, providing insights into the recruitment of genes of for the catabolism of emerging organic pollutants. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 11; Correspondence Address: C.O.

WHO classified scabies as a neglected tropical disease. The prevalence of scabies is high in certain countries ranging from 32.1% to 74%, especially in crowded conditions such as prisons, boarding schools, and orphanages. Indonesia is one of the most heavily affected countries worldwide. Scabies might cause great impact on patients, which includes decreased concentration and academic achievement at school, social stigma, sleep disturbances, and decreased economic productivity in community. Management of scabies with anti-scabies needs to be carried out appropriately, accompanied with treatment for all contacts. Mass treatment with permethrin cream or ivermectin can be given directly to patients. Prevention is conducted by providing medical treatment and breaking the chain of transmission. Source elimination and disinfection of fomites is very important. Participation of non-medical personnel such as teachers, cadres, and parents together with the local health workers (primary health care) is highly recommended. Using checklists or application can aid non-medical personnel to determine suspected cases, thus contributing to scabies elimination. Cooperation between patients, patient's family, health workers and other non-medical personnel will greatly reduce the prevalence of scabies and ultimately improve patient's quality of life. The aim of this review is to provide an update on scabies treatment and efforts for prevention and elimination, with focus on the situation in Indonesia. Copyright © 2022 Widaty et al.

Several epidemiological studies have assessed the possible association between PFAS exposure and risk of metabolic syndrome (MetS), however, the results are ambiguous. The aim of this study was to assess the current human epidemiologic evidence on the association between exposure to PFAS and MetS. We performed a systematic search strategy using three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science) for relevant studies concerning the associations of PFAS with MetS and its clinical relevance from inception until January 2021. We undertook meta-analyses where there were five or more studies with exposure and outcomes assessments that were reasonably comparable. The pooled odd ratios (ORs) were calculated using random effects models and heterogeneity among studies was assessed by I2 index and Q test. A total of 12 cross-sectional studies (10 studies on the general population and two studies in the occupational settings) investigated the association between PFAS exposure and MetS. We pooled data from seven studies on the general population for perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and five studies for perfluorohexanesulfonate (PFHxS) and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA). Predominately, most studies reported no statistically significant association between concentrations of PFAS and MetS. In the meta-analysis, the overall measure of effect was not statistically significant, showing no evidence of an association between concentrations of PFOA, PFOS, PFNA, and PFHxS and the risk of MetS. Based on the results of the meta-analysis, current small body of evidence does not support association between PFAS and MetS. However, due to limited number of studies and substantial heterogeneity, results should be interpreted with caution. Further scrutinizing cohort studies are needed to evaluate the association between various and less well-known PFAS substances and their mixture with MetS and its components in both adults and children in different settings.  © 2021 Maryam Zare Jeddi et al., published by De Gruyter, Berlin/Boston.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.

The zig-zag rachides morphology of the conidiogenous cells and spindle-shaped conidia were the distinct morphological characteristics of the P. album subclade 3 strains. The MLST data and morphological analysis supported the conclusion that the P. album subclade 3 strains could be classified as a new species of the genus Parengyodontium and placed in the family Cordycipitaceae. The name Parengyodontium torokii sp. nov. is proposed to accommodate the strain, with FJII-L10-SW-P1 as the holotype. The genome of the FJII-L10-SW-P1 strain was sequenced, annotated, and the secondary metabolite clusters were identified. Genes predicted to be responsible for biofilm formation and adhesion to surfaces were identified. Homology-based assignment of gene ontologies to the predicted proteome of P. torokii revealed the presence of gene clusters responsible for synthesizing several metabolic compounds, including a cytochalasin that was also verified using traditional metabolomic analysis. © 2022 by the authors.

Regarding the complications of PFAs, few studies have investigated periprosthetic fractures. The purpose of this literature review was to highlight a previously overlooked complication of primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint. Methods: Three literature databases were searched for studies published between 2000 to 2020 using relevant keywords. A total of 4,942 articles were originally identified. After excluding duplicates and analysing the titles and abstracts, 20 studies were considered. From these, data regarding the number of cases, clinical outcomes and complications were extracted. Results: Among the 20 selected articles, only one described periprosthetic fractures as a complication of PFAs. Herein, we also report an illustrative case of an unknown fracture complication. No cases in the literature were found that described the type of complications experienced by our patient during the postoperative period. Conclusions: This review confirms the lack of data about clinical outcomes and fracture complications of PFAs. In primary prosthetic surgery of the patellofemoral joint, patient selection and close consideration of demographic factors (such as BMI and age) and intraoperative factors (such as patellar thickness and size of the trochlear component) play a key role in optimising pre-operative planning to avoid intraoperative periprosthetic fractures. © The Author(s) 2022.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: G.

Postoperative anemia after fracture tends to cause ischemia, hypoxia in cells, tissues and organs, increasing the rate of blood transfusion, risk of infection, disability and mortality. Meanwhile, traditional Chinese medicine is widely used in the treatment of anemia for activating blood circulation and removing blood stasis.Methods:This study is a prospective, outcome assessor-, and data analyst-blinded randomized controlled clinical trial. The objective of this proposed study was to investigate whether Shengyu Decoction could improve the symptoms of anemia after proximal femoral nail antirotation in elderly ITF patients. After qualifying for screening, patients will be randomized into 2 groups with an allocation ratio of 1:1. Hemoglobin concentration, HBL, and HHS score are outcome measurements. The other outcomes also included time to get out of bed, discharge to home, 30-day readmission rates, and mortality.Discussion:ITF is commonly occurring in senior citizens, and those who are senior in age generally suffer 1 or more basic diseases, whose nutritional status is already poor. Trauma and surgical stimulation not only aggravate the existing disease or induce corresponding cardiovascular complications, but also worsen the nutritional status, which can easily cause postoperative anemia in patients. Because of the limited clinical modalities available for the treatment of postoperative anemia after fracture surgery, and most of them have various side effects that are not easily tolerated by the elderly. Therefore, from a traditional Chinese medicine perspective, we proposed a protocol using mild Chinese herbal decoction to treat postoperative anemia in ITF.Registration number: OSF Registration number: DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/JQ6ZF. © 2022 Lippincott Williams and Wilkins.

Only eight out of 30 malaria mosquito vectors (Anopheles species) have been examined for insecticide resistance in Iran. This study aimed to review articles related to the incremental trend in insecticide resistance and their mechanisms among anopheline malaria vectors in Iran. Methods: A literature review was conducted based on such search engines as Iran doc, Web of Science, SID, PubMed, Scopus, and Google Scholar websites using the following keywords: “Anopheles,” “Malaria,” “Resistance,” “Vectors,” “Insecticide Resistance,” and “Iran” for data collection. Published papers in English or Persian covering 1980 to 2020 were reviewed. Results: A total of 1125 articles were screened, only 16 of which were filtered to be pertinent in this review. While most of the mosquito vectors of malaria, such as Anopheles stephensi, were resistant to DDT, dieldrin, malathion, and becoming less susceptible to deltamethrin and other synthetic pyrethroid insecticides, few like Anopheles fluviatilis s. l. were susceptible to all insecticides. A disseminating trend in insecticide resistance among different anopheline mosquito vector species was evident. Metabolic and insecticide target-site resistance mechanisms were involved with organochlorines and pyrethroids, respectively. Conclusions: Insecticide resistance is becoming a severe scourge to the effectiveness of vector-borne disease management measures. This event is especially critical in developing and marginalized communities that applied chemical-based vector elimination programs for malaria; therefore, it is crucial to monitor insecticide resistance in malaria vectors in Iran using biochemical and molecular tools. © 2022","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 13; Correspondence Address: M.D. Moemenbellah-Fard; Research Center for Health Sciences, Institute of Health, Shiraz University of Medical Sciences, Shiraz, Iran; email: momenbf@sums.ac.ir",10.1016/j.heliyon.2022.e08830,Anophelinae;Carbamate;Knock-down resistance;Organophosphate;Pyrethrum;Culicidae;Iran;Malaria;Insecticides,NA,,monitoring of synthetic insecticides resistance and mechanisms among malaria vector mosquitoes in iran a systematic review

Microvascular decompression (MVD) with internal neurolysis (IN) is an alternative treatment that might benefit patients but has limited understanding. We performed a systematic review of IN for the treatment of TN. Methods: Studies from 2000 to 2021 that had assessed IN for TN were aggregated and independently reviewed. Results: A total of 520 patients in 12 studies were identified, with 384 who had undergone IN (mean age, 53.8 years; range, 46–61.4 years; mean follow-up, 36.5 months). Preoperative symptoms had been present for ∼55.0 months before treatment, and pain was predominantly in V2 and V3 (26.8%), followed by other distributions. Of the patients, 83.7% (range, 72%–93.8%) had had an excellent to good outcome (Barrow Neurological Institute pain scale score [BNI-PS], I–II). The pain outcomes at 1 year were excellent for 58%–78.4%, good or better for 77%–93.75%, and fair or better for 80%–93.75% of the patients. On average, facial numbness after IN was experienced by 96% of the patients. However, at follow-up, facial numbness remained in only 1.75%–10%. Most of the remaining numbness was not significantly distressing to the patients. Subgroup comparisons of IN versus recurrent MVD, IN versus radiofrequency ablation, the effects of IN in the absence of vascular compression, and IN with and without MVD were also evaluated. Conclusions: IN represents a promising surgical intervention for TN in the absence of vascular compression and for potential cases of recurrence. Complications were limited in general but require further study. © 2021 Elsevier Inc.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 1; Correspondence Address: J.J.

However, the detailed molecular mechanisms remain largely unknown. This study aims to investigate biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers underlying the association between serum PFAS and fetal growth using high-resolution metabolomics in a cohort of pregnant African American women in the Atlanta area, Georgia. Methods: Serum perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), and perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) measurements and untargeted serum metabolomics profiling were conducted in 313 pregnant African American women at 8–14 weeks gestation. Multiple linear regression models were applied to assess the associations of PFAS with birth weight and small-for-gestational age (SGA) birth. A high-resolution metabolomics workflow including metabolome-wide association study, pathway enrichment analysis, and chemical annotation and confirmation with a meet-in-the-middle approach was performed to characterize the biological pathways and intermediate biomarkers of the PFAS-fetal growth relationship. Results: Each log2-unit increase in serum PFNA concentration was significantly associated with higher odds of SGA birth (OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.07, 1.63); similar but borderline significant associations were found in PFOA (OR = 1.20, 95% CI 0.94, 1.49) with SGA. Among 25,516 metabolic features extracted from the serum samples, we successfully annotated and confirmed 10 overlapping metabolites associated with both PFAS and fetal growth endpoints, including glycine, taurine, uric acid, ferulic acid, 2-hexyl-3-phenyl-2-propenal, unsaturated fatty acid C18:1, androgenic hormone conjugate, parent bile acid, and bile acid-glycine conjugate. Also, we identified 21 overlapping metabolic pathways from pathway enrichment analyses. These overlapping metabolites and pathways were closely related to amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism perturbations. Conclusion: In this cohort of pregnant African American women, higher serum concentrations of PFOA and PFNA were associated with reduced fetal growth. Perturbations of biological pathways involved in amino acid, lipid and fatty acid, bile acid, and androgenic hormone metabolism were associated with PFAS exposures and reduced fetal growth, and uric acid was shown to be a potential intermediate biomarker.

These metabolism-sensitive diseases typically occur when key metabolic and signaling pathways were disrupted, which can be influenced by the exposure to contaminants such as endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), along with genetic and lifestyle factors. This promotes the concept and research on environmental metabolism disrupting chemicals (MDCs). In addition, identifying endogenous biochemical markers of effect linked to disease states is becoming an important tool to screen the biological targets following environmental contaminant exposure, as well as to provide an overview of toxicity risk assessment. As such, the current review aims to contribute to the further understanding of exposome and human health and disease by characterizing environmental exposure and effect metabolic biomarkers. We summarized MDC-associated metabolic biomarkers in laboratory animal and human cohort studies using high throughput targeted and nontargeted metabolomics techniques. Contaminants including heavy metals and organohalogen compounds, especially EDCs, have been repetitively associated with metabolic disorders, whereas emerging contaminants such as perfluoroalkyl substances and microplastics have also been found to disrupt metabolism. In addition, we found major limitations in the effective identification of metabolic biomarkers especially in human studies, toxicological research on the mixed effect of environmental exposure has also been insufficient compared to the research on single chemicals. Thus, it is timely to call for research efforts dedicated to the study of combined effect and metabolic alterations for the better assessment of exposomic toxicology and health risks.

Many studies have considered microbiota as critical regulators of the gut–brain axis. The crosstalk between microbiota and the central nervous system is mainly explained through three different pathways: the neural, endocrine, and immune pathways, intricately interconnected with each other. In day-to-day life, human beings are exposed to a wide variety of contaminants that affect our intestinal microbiota and alter the bidirectional communication between the gut and brain, causing neuronal disorders. The interplay between xenobiotics, microbiota and neurotoxicity is still not fully explored, especially for susceptible populations such as pregnant women, neonates, and developing children. Precisely, early exposure to contaminants can trigger neurodevelopmental toxicity and long-term diseases. There is growing but limited research on the specific mechanisms of the microbiota–gut–brain axis (MGBA), making it challenging to understand the effect of environmental pollutants. In this review, we discuss the biological interplay between microbiota–gut–brain and analyse the role of endocrine-disrupting chemicals: Bisphenol A (BPA), Chlorpyrifos (CPF), Diethylhexyl phthalate (DEHP), and Per-and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in MGBA perturbations and subsequent neurotoxicity. The complexity of the MGBA and the changing nature of the gut microbiota pose significant challenges for future research. However, emerging in-silico models able to analyse and interpret meta-omics data are a promising option for understanding the processes in this axis and can help prevent neurotoxicity. © 2022 by the authors.

However, the effect of garlic (Allium sativum L), one of such PFAs on the internal egg quality indices of laying hens is less clear. As a result, this meta-analysis investigated the impact of garlic supplementation on egg yolk weight (EYW) and egg yolk cholesterol (EYC) content in laying hens. A search carried out in three online databases yielded five hundred and ten studies of which fifteen passed the predefined selection conditions for the meta-analysis. Inclusion criteria were information on moderator variables (hen’s age, layer strains, presentation form, treatment duration, inclusion level, and the number of hens used for the study), and outcome measures (EYW and EYC) with their corresponding measures of variance. All analyses were performed in OpenMEE software. Results indicate that addition of garlic to layer diets increased EYW by 0.063 g [95% confidence interval (CI) = 95% CI: -0.051, 0.176] compared to zero, though the difference was not statistically significant. Similarly, garlic supplementation reduced EYC concentrations by 0.641 mg/g yolk (95% CI: -0.059, -0.424) in comparison with controls, taking publication bias and heterogeneity into consideration. Subgroup and meta-regression analyses revealed that modifiers had impact on the results and conclusion.

Both interventions use insecticides to kill mosquitoes that bite and rest indoors. Adding IRS to ITNs may improve malaria control simply because two interventions can be better than one. Furthermore, IRS may improve malaria control where ITNs are failing due to insecticide resistance. Pyrethroid insecticides are the predominant class of insecticide used for ITNs, as they are more safe than other insecticide classes when in prolonged contact with human skin. While many mosquito populations have developed some resistance to pyrethroid insecticides, a wider range of insecticides can be used for IRS. This review is an update of the previous Cochrane 2019 edition. Objectives: To summarize the effect on malaria of additionally implementing IRS, using non-pyrethroid-like or pyrethroid-like insecticides, in communities currently using ITNs. Search methods: We searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register; CENTRAL; MEDLINE; and five other databases for records from 1 January 2000 to 8 November 2021, on the basis that ITN programmes did not begin to be implemented as policy before the year 2000. Selection criteria: We included cluster-randomized controlled trials (cRCTs), interrupted time series (ITS), or controlled before-after studies (CBAs) comparing IRS plus ITNs with ITNs alone. We included studies with at least 50% ITN ownership (defined as the proportion of households owning one or more ITN) in both study arms. Data collection and analysis: Two review authors independently assessed studies for eligibility, analyzed risk of bias, and extracted data. We used risk ratio (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). We stratified by type of insecticide, 'pyrethroid-like' and 'non-pyrethroid-like'; the latter could improve malaria control better than adding IRS insecticides that have the same way of working as the insecticide on ITNs ('pyrethroid-like'). We used subgroup analysis of ITN usage in the studies to explore heterogeneity. We assessed the certainty of evidence using the GRADE approach. Main results: Eight cRCTs (10 comparisons), one CBA, and one ITS study, all conducted since 2008 in sub-Saharan Africa, met our inclusion criteria. The primary vectors in all sites were mosquitoes belonging to the Anopheles gambiae s.l. complex species; five studies in Benin, Mozambique, Ghana, Sudan, and Tanzania also reported the vector Anopheles funestus. Five cRCTs and both quasi-experimental design studies used insecticides with targets different to pyrethroids (two used bendiocarb, three used pirimiphos-methyl, and one used propoxur. Each of these studies were conducted in areas where the vectors were described as resistant or highly resistant to pyrethroids. Two cRCTs used dichloro-diphenyl-trichlorethane (DDT), an insecticide with the same target as pyrethroids. The remaining cRCT used both types of insecticide (pyrethroid deltamethrin in the first year, switching to bendiocarb for the second year). Indoor residual spraying using 'non-pyrethroid-like' insecticides. Six studies were included (four cRCTs, one CBA, and one ITS). Our main analysis for prevalence excluded a study at high risk of bias due to repeated sampling of the same population. This risk did not apply to other outcomes. Overall, the addition of IRS reduced malaria parasite prevalence (RR 0.61, 95% CI 0.42 to 0.88; 4 cRCTs, 16,394 participants; high-certainty evidence). IRS may also reduce malaria incidence on average (rate ratio 0.86, 95% CI 0.61 to 1.23; 4 cRCTs, 323,631 child-years; low-certainty evidence) but the effect was absent in two studies. Subgroup analyses did not explain the qualitative heterogeneity between studies. One cRCT reported no effect on malaria incidence or parasite prevalence in the first year, when a pyrethroid-like insecticide was used for IRS, but showed an effect on both outcomes in the second year, when a non-pyrethroid-like IRS was used. The addition of IRS may also reduce anaemia prevalence (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.38 to 1.31; 3 cRCTs, 4288 participants; low-certainty evidence). Four cRCTs reported the impact of IRS on entomological inoculation rate (EIR), with variable results; overall, we do not know if IRS had any effect on the EIR in communities using ITNs (very low-certainty evidence). Studies also reported the adult mosquito density and the sporozoite rate, but we could not summarize or pool these entomological outcomes due to differences in the reported data. Three studies measured the prevalence of pyrethroid resistance before and after IRS being introduced: there was no difference detected, but these data are limited. Indoor residual spraying using 'pyrethroid-like' insecticides. Adding IRS using a pyrethroid-like insecticide did not appear to markedly alter malaria incidence (rate ratio 1.07, 95% CI 0.80 to 1.43; 2 cRCTs, 15,717 child-years; moderate-certainty evidence), parasite prevalence (RR 1.11, 95% CI 0.86 to 1.44; 3 cRCTs, 10,820 participants; moderate-certainty evidence), or anaemia prevalence (RR 1.12, 95% CI 0.89 to 1.40; 1 cRCT, 4186 participants; low-certainty evidence). Data on EIR were limited so no conclusion was made (very low-certainty evidence). Authors' conclusions: in communities using ITNs, the addition of IRS with 'non-pyrethroid-like' insecticides was associated with reduced malaria prevalence. Malaria incidence may also be reduced on average, but there was unexplained qualitative heterogeneity, and the effect may therefore not be observed in all settings. When using 'pyrethroid-like' insecticides, there was no detectable additional benefit of IRS in communities using ITNs. Copyright © 2022 The Authors.

The etiology of preterm birth has not yet been elucidated. Although maternal exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) may increase the risk for preterm birth, associations have not been confirmed. We performed a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationships between maternal exposure to EDCs and preterm birth. A systematic search of PubMed, Ovid-EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies providing quantitative data on the association between maternal EDC exposure and preterm birth in humans was conducted in July 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. A total of 59 studies were included. The pooled results indicated that maternal exposure to metals (OR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.17 to 1.29) and phthalates (OR, 1.31; 95% CI, 1.21 to 1.42) was related to an increased risk for preterm birth. Specifically, maternal exposure to lead, cadmium, chromium, copper and manganese appeared to be correlated with an elevated risk for preterm birth. Additionally, maternal exposure to monoethyl phthalate (MEP), mono-2-ethyl-5-carboxypentyl phthalate (MECPP), monobenzyl phthalate (MBzP), and di (2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) was also associated with preterm birth.

Their adaptation in response to environmental stressors, particularly mitigating the impact of pollutants discharged from human activities, has been considered for the development of microbial biomonitoring tools, but their use is still in the infancy. Here, chemical and molecular (16S rRNA gene metabarcoding) approaches were combined in order to determine the impact of pollutants on microbial assemblages inhabiting the aquatic network of a soil-water-sediment continuum around the Ichkeul Lake (Tunisia), an area highly impacted by human activities. Samples were collected within the soil-river-lake continuum at three stations in dry (summer) and wet (winter) seasons. The contaminant pressure index (PI), which integrates Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), alkanes, Organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) and metal contents, and the microbial pressure index microgAMBI, based on bacterial community structure, showed significant correlation with contamination level and differences between seasons. The comparison of prokaryotic communities further revealed specific assemblages for soil, river and lake sediments. Correlation analyses identified potential “specialist” genera for the different compartments, whose abundances were correlated with the pollutant type found. Additionally, PICRUSt analysis revealed the metabolic potential for pollutant transformation or degradation of the identified “specialist” species, providing information to estimate the recovery capacity of the ecosystem. Such findings offer the possibility to define a relevant set of microbial indicators for assessing the effects of human activities on aquatic ecosystems. Microbial indicators, including the detection of “specialist” and sensitive taxa, and their functional capacity, might be useful, in combination with integrative microbial indices, to constitute accurate biomonitoring tools for the management and restoration of complex coastal aquatic systems. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 30; Correspondence Address: R.

PFPE has been widely used in aerospace, military, nuclear industry, computer disk and other fields. With the rapid development of industrial technology, new requirements have been proposed for the performance of the lubricants. As a result, the common perfluoropolyethers as lubricants gradually cannot work well under the present working conditions. Moreover, it is difficult to improve the lubrication performance of perfluoropolyethers by conventional additives technology due to their poor compatibility with conventional additives. Hence, in order to improve the antifriction and antiwear properties of perfluoropolyethers, researchers focused on modifying their structures. Great efforts have been paid to improve the performance of perfluoropolyethers as lubrication film in the field of computer disk, but as a kind of important aviation lubricating oils, their lubrication performances are also in urgent need of improvement. In this context, in this study three kinds of perfluoropolyether carboxylate ammonium ionic liquids (PF-BA, PF-DBA and PF-TBA) were designed and synthesized by modifying the structure of perfluoropolyether carboxylic acid (PFPEC) with different amines. The structures of synthesized ionic liquids were confirmed by infrared spectroscopy. Their shear stress and viscosity at different shear rates were evaluated by a Rheometer, and the wetting ability on metal surfaces were analyzed by the contact angle. Their lubrication performance for steel/steel and steel/tin bronze friction pairs at 25 ℃ and 100 ℃ were evaluated and compared by Optimal SRV-V oscillating friction and wear tester, where PFPE and PFPEC were used as reference samples. And the variation of the tribofilm during the friction process were revealed by the change of contact resistance. The surface morphologies and element state were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, respectively. Tribochemical reactions were investigated by comparing the change in surface morphologies and element state of wear spot. By combining the above results, the lubrication mechanism was explored. Results showed that all the synthesized ionic liquids exhibited higher shear stress and viscosity than PFPEC. Specifically, the ionic liquids with more N-H bonds in the cation exhibited higher viscosity and shear stress, possibly due to the formation of hydrogen bond that can increase the intermolecular interactions. The viscosity and shear stress gradually decreased with the increase of shear rate, while the viscosity of the ionic liquids with more N-H bond in the cation decreased more rapidly. On the surface of tin bronze, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting performance than PFPEC, but poorer than PFPE. While on the steel surface, the three ionic liquids exhibited better wetting abilities than PFPEC and PFPE. As lubricants for steel/tin bronze friction pairs, the friction coefficients and wear volumes of the three ionic liquids were close to those of PFPE and PFPEC at room temperature, and their lubrication performance was improved insignificantly. The synthesized ionic liquids exhibited much better anti-friction and anti-wear performance at high temperature (100 ℃) than PFPE and PFPEC. As lubricants for steel/steel friction pairs at room temperature, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were similar to that of PFPEC, and even a little higher than PFPE; while the wear volumes decreased about 60%-70% in comparison with PFPE and PFPEC. At 100 ℃, compared with PFPE and PFPEC, the friction coefficients of the three ionic liquids were much more stable and lower, and the wear volumes were reduced by 70% ~ 80%. Summarily, three synthesized ionic liquids had better friction-reduction and anti-wear properties than that of PFPE and PFPEC both at room temperature and at high temperature as lubricants for steel/steel friction pair. The contact resistances reflected the variation of the tribofilm, i.e. the higher contact resistance, the thicker tribofilm and better lubricating properties. The results of tested contact resistances were consistent with the friction tests results. According to the SEM morphologies of the worn surface lubricated by different lubricants, both the tin bronze and steel worn surfaces exhibited abrasive wear. Among them, the worn surfaces lubricated by ionic liquids PF-TBA were the smoother, and the parallel grooves were the shallower both at room temperature and high temperature. The steel worn surfaces lubricated by the three ionic liquids were much smoother than that of PEPE and PEPEC. From the XPS results, it can be seen that the composition and content of the friction films on the worn surface lubricated by the three synthesized ionic liquids were different from that of PEPEC. The tribofilm formed on the steel surfaces lubricated by the ionic liquids was consisted of Fe3O4, Fe2O3 and FeF3, the nitrogen-containing compounds and adsorbed ionic liquids. The adsorption film of the ionic liquids on the metal surface was strong and the tribofilm was thick. The combined results of multiple physical and chemical analysis showed that the excellent friction-reduction and anti-wear properties of synthesized ionic liquids can be attributed to their excellent adsorption properties on the metal surface and the formation of stable tribofilm.

Aging processes such as UV irradiation, biodegradation, physical abrasion and chemical oxidation can affect the environmental behavior of MPs. This review article summarizes different aging processes of MPs and subsequent effects on the adsorption of pollutants, the leaching of additives, and the toxicity of MPs. In addition, the formation process of biofilm on the surface of MPs and the interactions between biofilm and aged MPs are revealed. MPs can accumulate different environmental pollutants (organic pollutants, heavy metals, microorganisms, etc.) through surface adsorption, pore filling and distribution. Moreover, the aging of MPs affects their adsorption performance toward these pollutants due to a series of changes in their specific surface area and oxygen-containing functional groups. The release of some toxic additives such as phthalates after aging can enhance the toxic effects of MPs. Aging also changes the shape and size of MPs, which can affect the eating habits of the organisms and further increase the potential toxicity of MPs. This article conducts a systematical analysis and summary of the environmental behavior and physicochemical properties of MPs as well as the changes due to MPs aging, which helps to better understand the impact of aging on MPs in the environment.

A large number of organic chemicals are termed as “micropollutants” due to their low concentrations, and long-term exposure to micropollutants may pose considerable risks to aquatic organisms and human health. In recent decades, numerous treatment methods and technologies have been proposed to remove micropollutants in water, and typically several micropollutants were chosen as target pollutants to evaluate removal efficiencies. However, it is often unclear whether their toxicity and occurrence levels and frequencies enable them to contribute significantly to the overall chemical pollution in global aquatic environments. This review intends to answer an important lingering question: Which micropollutants or class of micropollutants deserve more attention globally and should be removed with higher priority? Different risk-based prioritization approaches were used to address this question. The risk quotient (RQ) method was found to be a feasible approach to prioritize micropollutants in a large scale due to its relatively simple assessment procedure and extensive use. A total of 83 prioritization case studies using the RQ method in the past decade were compiled, and 473 compounds that were selected by screening 3466 compounds of three broad classes (pharmaceuticals and personal care products (PPCPs), pesticides, and industrial chemicals) were found to have risks (RQ > 0.01). To determine the micropollutants of global importance, we propose an overall risk surrogate, that is, the weighted average risk quotient (WARQ). The WARQ integrates the risk intensity and frequency of micropollutants in global aquatic environments to achieve a more comprehensive priority determination. Through metadata analysis, we recommend a ranked list of 53 micropollutants, including 36 PPCPs (e.g., sulfamethoxazole and ibuprofen), seven pesticides (e.g., heptachlor and diazinon), and 10 industrial chemicals (e.g., perfluorooctanesulfonic acid and 4-nonylphenol) for risk management and remediation efforts. One caveat is that the ranked list of global importance does not consider transformation products of micropollutants (including disinfection byproducts) and new forms of pollutants (including antibiotic resistance genes and microplastics), and this list of global importance may not be directly applicable to a specific region or country. Also, it needs mentioning that there might be no best answer toward this question, and hopefully this review can act as a small step toward a better answer. © 2021 American Chemical Society","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 170; Correspondence Address: X.

In China, many monitoring studies have been undertaken to reveal the level of PCBs in environment since 2005 due to the introduced stricter environmental regulations. However, there are still significant gaps in understanding the overall spatial and temporal distributions of PCBs in China. This review systematically discusses the occurrence and distribution of PCBs in environmental matrices, organisms, and humans in China. Results showed that PCB contamination in northern and southern China was not significantly different, but the PCB levels in East China were commonly higher than those in West China, which might have been due to the widespread consumption of PCBs and intensive human activities in East China. Serious PCB contamination was found in e-waste disassembling areas (e.g., Taizhou of Zhejiang Province and Qingyuan and Guiyu of Guangdong Province). Higher PCB concentrations were also chronicled in megalopolises and industrial clusters. The unintentionally produced PCBs (UP-PCBs) formed during industrial thermal processes may play an increasingly significant role in PCB pollution in China. Low PCB levels were recorded in rural and underdeveloped districts, particularly in remote and high-altitude localities such as the Tibetan Plateau and the South China Sea. However, these data are limited. Human exposure to PCBs is closely related to the characteristics of environmental pollution. This review also discusses existing issues and future research prospects on PCBs in China. For instance, the accumulation characteristics and migration regularities of PCBs in food webs should be further studied. More investigations should be undertaken to assess the quantitative relationship between external and internal exposure to PCBs. For example, bioaccessibility and bioavailability studies should be supplemented to evaluate human health risks more accurately. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 69; Correspondence Address: H.

Although the aetiology remains unclear, evidence is mounting that exposure to persistent hydrocarbon pollutants is a substantial risk factor, predisposing a person to neurological diseases later in life. Epidemiological studies correlate environmental hydrocarbon exposure to brain disorders including neuropathies, cognitive, motor and sensory impairments; neurodevelopmental disorders like autism spectrum disorder (ASD); and neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and Parkinson’s disease (PD). Particulate matter, benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and endocrine-disrupting chemicals have all been linked to neurodevelopmental problems in all class of people. There is mounting evidence that supports the prevalence of petroleum hydrocarbon becoming neurotoxic and being involved in the pathogenesis of AD and PD. More study is needed to fully comprehend the scope of these problems in the context of unconventional oil and natural gas.

Many of them are a matter of growing concern worldwide. The use of ultrasound to eliminate these compounds arises as an interesting alternative for treating mineral water, seawater, and urine. Thereby, this work presents a systematic and critical review of the literature on the elimination of organic contaminants in these particular matrices, using ultrasound-based processes. The degradation efficiency of the sonochemical systems, the influence of the nature of the pollutant (volatile, hydrophobic, or hydrophilic character), matrix effects (enhancement or detrimental ability compared to pure water), and the role of the contaminant concentration were considered. The combinations of ultrasound with other degradation processes, to overcome the intrinsic limitations of the sonochemical process, were considered. Also, energy consumptions and energy costs associated with pollutants degradation in the target matrices were estimated. Moreover, the gaps that should be developed in future works, on the sonodegradation of organic contaminants in mineral water, seawater, and urine, were discussed. © 2021","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 29; Correspondence Address: E.A.

However, as a result of modernization, water consumption is dramatically in increase although the water supply remains constant. Unfortunately every sector consumes water resulting in massive amounts of wastewater that requires treatment prior to their final disposal that still a challenge to the modern societies. Among the various technologies investigated, adsorption considered the most widely applied technology for safe environmental remediation. In this regard, the term of green adsorbents is introduced that is meant the low-cost materials originated from waste, i.e., agriculture waste to be valuable adsorbents. Thus, extensive list of different adsorbents from natural, industrial waste, agriculture bio-products or modified materials have been applied for the elimination of various contaminants from aqueous matrix are compiled here as a demanding area since it has double benefits as an industrial ecology approach. Also, this article discusses the basic principles of adsorption process including the adsorption isotherm and kinetic models. Although numerous review articles are dealing with low-cost adsorption performances, there is insufficient information on the emerging pollutants elimination. The major focus of this work is highlighting the research on the application of the low-cost adsorbents on the emerging pollutants, namely, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, personal care products and perfluorinated compounds. Scattered information on using various adsorbents are provided information in adsorbing emerging pollutants uptake reached to 920 mg/g. The main parameters that affect the adsorption process and the economic prospective is also discussed. Desorption and recycling scenario is concluded and desorption efficiency could reach to 99%. Finally, the future development of further research and few suggestions are also prospected. © 2021 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 35; Correspondence Address: M.A. Tony; Advanced Materials/Solar Energy and Environmental Sustainability (AMSEES) Laboratory, Basic Engineering Science Department, Faculty of Engineering, Menoufia University, Shebin El-Kom, Egypt; email: dr.maha.tony@gmail.com",10.1080/01932691.2021.1878037,Adsorption;industrial ecology;natural waste;waste management;wastewater treatment;Agricultural robots;Agricultural wastes;Agriculture;Bioproducts;Costs;Desorption;Efficiency;Environmental technology;Wastewater disposal;Wastewater treatment;Water supply;Adsorption performance;Desorption efficiency;Emerging pollutants;Environmental pollution control;Environmental remediation;Perfluorinated compounds;Personal care products;Various technologies;Pollution control,NA,,lowcost adsorbents for environmental pollution control a concise systematic review from the prospective of principles mechanism and their applications

However, the symptoms can be successfully managed with proper medication and lifestyle interventions. Despite its prevalence, little is known about its etiology. In this review article, the up-to-date diagnostic features and parameters recommended on the grounds of evidence-based data and different guidelines are explored. The ambiguity and insufficiency of data when diagnosing adolescent women have been put under special focus. We look at some of the most recent research done to establish relationships between different gene polymorphisms with polycystic ovary syndrome in various populations along with the underestimated impact of environmental factors like endocrine-disrupting chemicals on the reproductive health of these women. Furthermore, the article concludes with existing treatments options and the scopes for advancement in the near future. Various therapies have been considered as potential treatment through multiple randomized controlled studies, and clinical trials conducted over the years are described in this article. Standard therapies ranging from metformin to newly found alternatives based on vitamin D and gut microbiota could shine some light and guidance toward a permanent cure for this female reproductive health issue in the future. © The Author(s) 2022.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 12; Correspondence Address: F.K.M.

Objective: To investigate the mechanism underlying the repair of DEHP-induced sperm DNA damage in mice by Wuwei Fuzheng Yijing (WFY) formula. Materials and methods: The potential targets of WFY and sperm DNA fragment (SDF) were obtained from the TCMSP, BATMAN-TCM, OMIM and GeneCards. The protein–protein interaction (PPI) network, GO and KEGG pathway analyses of WFY-SDF were constructed. An animal model of DEHP-induced sperm DNA damage was replicated by gavage of SPF ICR (CD1) mice DEHP at 1 g/kg/d and treated with WFY at 8.92, 17.84 and 35.67 g/kg, respectively, for 60 d. Sperm DFI of each group was detected and compared. The target genes of WFY identified by transcriptomic and proteomic analyses were validated by qRT-PCR and Western blotting. Results: Network pharmacology pathway analysis indicated that PI3K/Akt was the potential target of WFY on SDF. The DFI of the DEHP group (25.48%) was significantly higher than that of the control group (4.02%). The high-dose WFY group (19.05%) exhibited the most significant repairing effect. The related pathways were PI3K/Akt and metabolic. Aass, Aldh1a7, GSTA3, betaine homocysteine S-methyltransferase (Bhmt), Mug2 and Svs1 were screened and Bhmt was validated. Discussion and conclusions: WFY can repair sperm DNA damage caused by DEHP, and the mechanism may be related to PI3K/Akt and metabolic pathways, and Bhmt.

This article aims to provide a narrative updated review on the management of pediculosis capitis. Methods: A PubMed search was performed with Clinical Queries using the key terms ""pediculosis capitis"" OR ""head lice"" OR ""head louse"". The search strategy included clinical trials, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, observational studies and reviews published within the past 10 years. The search was restricted to articles published in English literature. The information retrieved from the search was used in the compilation of the present article. Results: Topical permethrin and pyrethrin formulated with piperonyl butoxide are the pediculicides of choice in areas where resistance to these products is low. When resistance to these products is suspected based on local levels of resistance or when treatment with these products fails despite their correct use, and reinfestation does not seem to be responsible, other topical treatment options include malathion, benzyl alcohol, dimethicone, spinosad and ivermectin. Wet combing should be considered for children younger than 2 years. Oral ivermectin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole should be reserved for patients who do not respond to appropriate topical pediculicides. Conclusion: Many topical pediculicides are effective for the treatment of pediculosis capitis. The use of some of these pediculicides is limited for safety reasons, especially in children younger than 2 years. Resistance to pediculicides, especially those with a neurotoxic mode of action, is another concern which may limit the use of some of these pediculicides. New products should be evaluated for effectiveness and safety. Wet combing is time-consuming and should not be used as the sole intervention in the general population. © 2022 Bioexcel Publishing LTD.

Recent reports indicate the Australian community consumes more than twice the defined daily doses (DDD) of antibiotics per 1000 population than in Sweden, and about 20% more than in the United Kingdom (UK). We compare measures of public knowledge, attitudes and practices (KAP) surrounding AMR in Australia, the UK and Sweden against the policy approaches taken in these settings to address inappropriate antibiotic use. Methods National antimicrobial stewardship policies in Australia, Sweden, and the UK were reviewed, supplemented by empirical studies of their effectiveness. We searched PubMed, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL databases for primary studies of the general public's KAP around antibiotic use and AMR in each setting (January 1 2011 until July 30 2021). Where feasible, we meta-analysed data on the proportion of participants agreeing with identical or very similar survey questions, using a random effects model. Results Policies in Sweden enact tighter control of community antibiotic use; reducing antibiotic use through public awareness raising is not a priority. Policies in the UK and Australia are more reliant on practitioner and public education to encourage appropriate antibiotic use. 26 KAP were included in the review and 16 were meta-analysable. KAP respondents in Australia and the UK are consistently more likely to report beliefs and behaviours that are not aligned with appropriate antibiotic use, compared to participants in similar studies conducted in Sweden. Conclusions Interactions between public knowledge, attitudes and their impacts on behaviours surrounding community use of antibiotics are complex and contingent. Despite a greater focus on raising public awareness in Australia and the UK, neither antibiotic consumption nor community knowledge and attitudes are changing significantly. Clearly public education campaigns can contribute to mitigating AMR. However, the relative success of policy approaches taken in Sweden suggests that practice level interventions may also be required to activate prescribers and the communities they serve to make substantive reductions in inappropriate antibiotic use.

Grow-ing evidence has shown that intestinal bacterial alterations caused by BPA exposure play an important role in several local and systemic diseases. Aims: finding evidence that BPA-induced alterations in gut microbiota composition and activity may perturb its role on human health. Results: Evidence from several experimental settings shows that both low and high doses of BPA in-terfere with the hormonal, homeostatic, and reproductive systems in animals and humans. Moreover, it has recently been classified as an environmental obesogenic, with metabolic-disrupting effects on lipid metabolism and pancreatic b-cell functions. Several evidence characterizes PBA as an environmental contributor to type II diabetes, metabolic syndromes, and obesity. However, the highest estimates of the exposure derived from foods alone or in combination with other sources are 3 to 5 times below the new tolerable daily intake (TDI) value, today reduced by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) experts from 50 micrograms per kilogramme of bodyweight per day (µg/kg bw/day) to 4 µg/kg bw/day. Conclusion: Considering estimates for the total amount of BPA that can be ingested daily over a lifetime, many International Health Authorities conclude that dietary exposure of adult humans to BPA does not represent a risk to consumers' health, declaring its safety due to very-low established levels in food and water and any appreciable health risk. © 2022 Bentham Science Publishers.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 21; Correspondence Address: I.A.

Objective: To summarize the epidemiological evidence for the association of p,p'-DDT exposure and its breakdown products with the risk of diabetes and HTN from prospective studies. Methods: We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) statement. Eligible studies (prospective) were search in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and SciELO databases (July 11, 2020). Different search algorithms were used for diabetes and HTN. Pooled odds ratios (ORs) were estimated from meta-analysis with random effects for each exposure and outcome. Results: A total of 23 prospective studies were included in this review, 16 assessed diabetes and seven HTN; very few measured p,p'-DDT. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was associated with a slightly increased risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) (pooled OR = 1.44; 95%CI: 1.00, 2.07; p = 0.049) and HTN (pooled OR = 1.21; 95%CI: 1.07, 1.38). Dose-response meta-analysis suggested a non-linear relation between p,p'-DDE and T2D. Exposure to p,p'-DDE was not associated with gestational diabetes (pooled OR = 1.01; 95%CI: 0.94, 1.09); similarly, p,p'-DDT was not associated with T2D (pooled OR = 1.03; 95%CI: 0.79, 1.35). Conclusions: Evidence from prospective studies suggests that exposure to p,p'-DDE, the main breakdown product of p,p'-DDT, might increase the risk of developing T2D; such increase may be apparent only at low levels. Exposure to p,p'-DDE may also increase the risk of having HTN; however, further evidence is required. © 2021 Elsevier GmbH","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 15; Correspondence Address: L.A.

Widespread use of PFAS in industrial processing and manufacturing over the last 70 years has led to global contamination of built and natural environments. The brain is a lipid rich and highly vascularized organ composed of long-lived neurons and glial cells that are especially vulnerable to the impacts of persistent and lipophilic toxicants. Generally, PFAS partition to protein-rich tissues of the body, primarily the liver and blood, but are also detected in the brains of humans, wildlife, and laboratory animals. Here we review factors impacting the absorption, distribution, and accumulation of PFAS in the brain, and currently available evidence for neurotoxic impacts defined by disruption of neurochemical, neurophysiological, and behavioral endpoints. Emphasis is placed on the neurotoxic potential of exposures during critical periods of development and in sensitive populations, and factors that may exacerbate neurotoxicity of PFAS. While limitations and inconsistencies across studies exist, the available body of evidence suggests that the neurobehavioral impacts of long-chain PFAS exposures during development are more pronounced than impacts resulting from exposure during adulthood. There is a paucity of experimental studies evaluating neurobehavioral and molecular mechanisms of short-chain PFAS, and even greater data gaps in the analysis of neurotoxicity for PFAS outside of the perfluoroalkyl acids. Whereas most experimental studies were focused on acute and subchronic impacts resulting from high dose exposures to a single PFAS congener, more realistic exposures for humans and wildlife are mixtures exposures that are relatively chronic and low dose in nature. Our evaluation of the available human epidemiological, experimental, and wildlife data also indicates heightened accumulation of perfluoroalkyl acids in the brain after environmental exposure, in comparison to the experimental studies. These findings highlight the need for additional experimental analysis of neurodevelopmental impacts of environmentally relevant concentrations and complex mixtures of PFAS.

Previous systematic reviews of epidemiologic studies published between 1991 through 2013 have reported associations between environmental and occupational pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality, particularly associations with reduced sperm concentration. This systematic review used the Navigation Guide to critically evaluate the current body of evidence examining sperm quality and pesticide exposure in epidemiological studies. PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were searched for all English-language articles published after September 2012 until August 2021. Original observational studies that assessed human sperm quality parameters, defined as concentration, motility, morphology, and DNA integrity, and individual-level pesticide exposure were included. The risk of bias for each included study and the strength of evidence were evaluated using the Navigation Guide protocol. Nineteen studies assessing environmental or occupational pesticide exposure and sperm parameters were included. Eighteen studies were cross-sectional studies and one prospective cohort; sample sizes ranged from 42 to 2122 men from 14 different countries. Fifteen (79 %) studies found at least one significant association between pesticide exposure and reduced sperm quality. The overall risk of bias across studies was classified as low to moderate. The quality of evidence was determined to be moderate based on systematic evaluation criteria. There were consistent adverse associations between pesticide exposure and sperm motility (63 % of studies) and DNA integrity (80 % of studies). For sperm concentration and morphology, 42 % and 36 % of studies found significant negative associations, respectively. The strength of the body of evidence overall was rated as having sufficient evidence of toxicity. Regarding specific sperm endpoints, there was sufficient evidence that pesticides are toxic for sperm motility and DNA integrity; limited evidence of toxicity for sperm concentration; and inadequate evidence of toxicity for sperm morphology. The studies reviewed here showed consistent associations between pesticide exposure and diminished sperm parameters, particularly sperm motility and sperm DNA integrity. These findings are largely consistent with results of previous reviews, which have found significant negative associations between pesticide exposure and sperm quality in 13 of 20 (65 %) studies published between 1991 and 2008, and in 14 of 17 (82 %) studies published between 2008 and 2012.

In this study, the comparative profiles of metabolites in three-dimensional (3D) human normal liver (L-02) cell spheroids with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) treatment were analyzed using a metabolomic approach. The uniform 3D cell spheroids were well formed in 3 days (e.g., sphericity index >0.9) and stably maintained over the subsequent 11 days. The cytotoxicity of PFOA to the 3D L-02 cell spheroids was highly dependent on both exposure concentration and duration. Comparative analysis of metabolomes showed that the number of differential metabolites in the 3D cell spheroids treated with 300 μM PFOA for 10 days (n = 59) was greater than those with a 4-day exposure to 300 μM PFOA (n = 17). Six metabolic pathways related to amino acids metabolism were only found in the 3D cell spheroids with a 10-day treatment of 300 μM PFOA, which could not be found in the 2D monolayer cells and those 3D cell spheroids with a 4-day exposure. The suppression of PFOA on glutamine metabolism substantially decreased glutathione (GSH) production and accordingly increased the level of reactive oxygen species in the 3D cell spheroids. On the contrary, the supplementation of glutamine increased GSH production and the viability of cell spheroids, indicating that glutamine metabolism played a critical role in the chronic toxic effects of PFOA.

This study aimed to review the insecticide resistance status was previously determined in Asia and how to implement the necessary interventions. Moreover, the implications of resistance in malaria vector control in this region were studied. Methods: This systematic review was conducted using a predefined protocol based on PRISMA-retrieved articles from four science databases, namely ProQuest, Science Direct, EBSCO, and PubMed in the last ten years (2009 to 2019). The searching process utilized four main combinations of the following keywords: malaria, vector control, insecticide, and Asia. In ProQuest, malaria control, as well as an insecticide, were used as keywords. The following criteria were included in the filter, namely full text, the source of each article, scholarly journal, Asia, and publication date as in the last ten years. Results: There were 1408 articles retrieved during the initial search (ProQuest=722, Science Direct=267, EBSCO=50, PubMed=285, and Scopus=84). During the screening, 27 articles were excluded because of duplication, 1361 based on title and abstract incompatibility with the inclusion criteria, and 20 due to content differences. In the final screening process, 15 articles were chosen to be analyzed. From the 15 articles, it is known that there was organochlorine (DDT), organophosphate (malathion), and pyrethroids resistance in several Anopheles species with a less than 80% mortality rate. Conclusion: This review found multiple resistance in several Anopheles includes resistance to pyrethroid. The reports of pyrethroid resistance were quite challenging because it is considered effective in the malaria vector control. Several countries in Asia are implementing an insecticide resistance management (IRM) strategy against malaria vectors following the Global Plan for IRM. © 2022 Susanna D and Pratiwi D.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 7; Correspondence Address: D.

The complex interactions that occur between synthetic MPs polymers and hydrophobic toxic compounds, metals, additives, and other emergent contaminants complicates the standardization of techniques used for the extraction and quantitation of these chemicals. Organic compounds are extracted from MPs by soaking, sonication, and the use of microwave, Soxhlet and accelerated solvent extraction (ASE) techniques in a variety of polar and nonpolar solvents. The extracts are cleaned up through solid-phase extraction (SPE) and analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) or liquid chromatography (LC) using an assortment of detectors. The analysis of metals from MPs is more standardized, usually with extraction in 20% aqua regia and analysis by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrophotometry (ICP-MS). Published papers do not consistently report the use of standards, detection levels, and other quality control measures.

Although there exist different policies related to E-waste management, its recycling is done mainly by unorganized sectors which leads to the release of toxic leachates and acid in the soils. Microbial communities thriving in waste-waste contaminated sites have been the center of research interest for a long. These communities thriving in e-waste contaminated sites have developed resistance mechanisms to heavy metals and persistent organic pollutants. These microbe-mediated bioremediation techniques may serve as an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to the traditional way of treatment.

Sampling methods have significant influences on the identification of chemical compositions and source contributions, with Quartz and Teflon filters being the most widely used. Receptor models are commonly adopted for identifying the sources of PM2.5, such as positive matrix factorization, chemical mass balance, principal component analysis, and UNMIX models, which have their respective advantages and limitations that determine their applications. The variations of PM2.5 compositions and sources in the past two decades in Beijing are also reviewed, which is the political, economic, and cultural center of China and is experiencing severe haze pollution events frequently. It was found that organic matters were the largest component (28.2%) in PM2.5, followed by sulfate (15.1%) during 2004–2013, which was overtaken by nitrate (14.9%) after 2013. Each PM2.5 source demonstrated significant seasonal and annual variations due to changes in climatic conditions and anthropogenic activities.

These bio-based fertilizers have heterogeneous nutrient and metal contents, resulting in a range of possible application rates. To avoid nutrient losses to water or bioaccumulation of metals in soil or crops, it is important that rates applied to land are safe and adhere to the maximum legal application rates similar to inorganic fertilizers. This study collected and analysed nutrient and metal content of all major DPS (n = 84) and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products (n = 10), and created an application calculator in MS Excel™ to provide guidance on maximum legal application rates for ryegrass and spring wheat across plant available phosphorus (P) deficient soil to P-excess soil. The sample analysis showed that raw DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS have high P contents ranging from 10.1 to 122 g kg−1. Nitrogen (N) in DPS was high, whereas N concentrations decreased in thermo-chemical STRUBIAS products (chars and ash) due to the high temperatures used in their formation. The heavy metal content of DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS was significantly lower than the EU imposed limits. Using the calculator, application rates of DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS materials (dry weight) ranged from 0 to 4.0 tonnes ha−1 y−1 for ryegrass and 0–4.5 tonnes ha−1 y−1 for spring wheat. The estimated heavy metal ingestion to soil annually by the application of the DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products was lower than the EU guideline on soil metal accumulation. The calculator is adaptable for any bio-based fertilizer, soil and crop type, and future work should continue to characterise and incorporate new DPS and DPS-derived STRUBIAS products into the database presented in this paper. In addition, safe application rates pertaining to other regulated pollutants or emerging contaminants that may be identified in these products should be included. The fertilizer replacement value of these products, taken from long-term field studies, should be factored into application rates. © 2021 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 9; Correspondence Address: O.

Lay abstract: Autism spectrum disorders comprise a complex group with many subtypes of behaviorally defined neurodevelopmental abnormalities in two core areas: deficits in social communication and fixated, restricted, repetitive, or stereotyped behaviors and interests each with potential unique risk factors and characteristics. The underlying mechanisms and the possible causes of autism spectrum disorder remain elusive and while increased prevalence is undoubtable, it is unclear if it is a reflection of diagnostic improvement or emerging risk factors such as endocrine disrupting chemicals. Epidemiological studies, which are used to study the relation between endocrine disrupting chemicals and autism spectrum disorder, can have inherent methodological challenges that limit the quality and strength of their findings. The objective of this work is to systematically review the treatment of these challenges and assess the quality and strength of the findings in the currently available literature.

The bibliographic analysis was applied to evaluate how approaches in sediment assessment have evolved. A meta-analysis was performed, to evaluate potential risks of sedimentary persistent toxic substances (PTSs) reported in Korean coastal waters. Within the framework, we identified and discussed current status and spatiotemporal trends in contamination of both classic and emerging PTSs over the recent decadal period. Out of 26 target regions in Korea, five hotspots (Sihwa, Masan, Ulsan, Taean, and Gwangyang) of concern could be identified. Four of those regions have been designated as Specially-Managed Sea Area under the implementation of Total Pollution Load Management System in Korea, except for Taean coast (oil spill site). Meantime, we could identify three stepwise research phases based on a bibliographic analysis; Phase 1 (1995–2008), Phase 2 (2009–2015), and Phase 3 (2016–2020). It is noteworthy that a technical evolution of the SQT assessment by the phase was featured. It was also evidenced that in-depth studies adopting multiple lines of evidence (LOEs) became prevailed upon approaching Phase 3. In a quantitative manner, the toxicity explanatory power of target PTSs increased by about 10% in Phase 3 compared to the earlier phases. The meta-analysis using ratio-to-mean value method applied for the data set having all three LOEs indicated general improvement of sediment qualities in the hotspots. However, their associations quite varied across regions and years, reflecting a dynamicity in oceanographic settings and/or heterogeneity in toxicological effect or benthic community response. At present, SQT assessment adopting the increased LOEs generally supports better assessment. In conclusion, we suggest that future SQT studies globally should reaffirm the utility of the “multiple LOEs approach”, focusing on the identification and management of causative toxicants that driving negative ecological impacts on marine ecosystems. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 8; Correspondence Address: J.S.

In this study, an aromatic ring cleavage module, a salicylic acid synthesis module, and a catechol metabolism module were respectively constructed in three Escherichia coli BL21 strains. Subsequently, the engineered strains were cocultured as an artificial consortium for the biodegradation of phenanthrene, a typical PHA. Single factor experiments and response surface methodology were used to identify the optimal degradation conditions, including an inoculation interval of 6 h, inoculation ratio of 1:1:1, and IPTG concentration of 2 mM. Under these conditions, the 7-day degradation ratio of 100 mg/L phenanthrene reached 72.67%. Moreover, the engineered Escherichia coli BL21 strains showed good phenanthrene degradation ability at substrate concentrations 10 mg/L up to 500 mg/L. Enzyme activity assays combined with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry measurements confirmed that the three engineered strains behaved as a synergistic consortium in the phenanthrene degradation process. Based on the analysis of the key metabolites, the engineered bacteria were supplemented at 7-day intervals in batches so that each engineered strain maintained its optimal degradation ability. The 21-day degradation ratio finally reached 90.66%, which was much higher than what was observed with simultaneous inoculation.

Increasing epidemiological evidence suggest that EDCs may affect the development or progression of breast cancer and consequently lead to lifelong harmful health consequences, especially when exposure occurs during early life in humans. Yet so far no appraisal of the available evidence has been conducted on this topic. Objective: To systematically review all the available epidemiological studies about the association of the levels of environmental exposures of EDCs with breast cancer risk. Methods: The search was performed in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines. We retrieved articles from PubMed (MEDLINE) until 10 March 2021. The key words used in this research were: “Endocrine disruptor(s)” OR “Endocrine disrupting chemical(s)” OR any of the EDCs mentioned below AND “Breast cancer” to locate all relevant articles published. We included only cohort studies and case-control studies. All relevant articles were accessed in full text and were evaluated and summarized in tables. Results: We identified 131 studies that met the search criteria and were included in this systematic review. EDCs reviewed herein included pesticides (e.g. p,p’-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p’-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), atrazine, 2,3,7,8-tetrachloridibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD or dioxin)), synthetic chemicals (e.g. bisphenol A (BPA), phthalates, per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), parabens, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs), contraceptive pills), phytoestrogens (e.g. genistein, resveratrol), and certain mycotoxins (e.g. zearalenone). Most studies assessed environmental EDCs exposure via biomarker measurements. Conclusion: We identified certain EDC exposures could potentially elevate the risk of breast cancer. As majority of EDCs are highly persistent in the environment and bio-accumulative, it is essential to assess the long-term impacts of EDC exposures, especially multi-generational and transgenerational. Also, since food is often a major route of exposure to EDCs, well-designed exposure assessments of potential EDCs in food and food packing are necessary and their potential link to breast cancer development need to be carefully evaluated for subsequent EDC policy making and regulations. © 2021 The Author(s).

PD is considered a multifactorial disease, since both genetic and environmental factors contribute to its pathogenesis, although the molecular mechanisms linking these two key disease modifiers remain obscure. In this context, epigenetic mechanisms that alter gene expression without affecting the DNA sequence through DNA methylation, histone post-transcriptional modifications, and non-coding RNAs may represent the key mediators of the genetic–environmental interactions underlying PD pathogenesis. Environmental exposures may cause chemical alterations in several cellular functions, including gene expression. Emerging evidence has highlighted that smoking, coffee consumption, pesticide exposure, and heavy metals (manganese, arsenic, lead, etc.) may potentially affect the risk of PD development at least partially via epigenetic modifications. Herein, we discuss recent accumulating pre-clinical and clinical evidence of the impact of lifestyle and environmental factors on the epigenetic mechanisms underlying PD development, aiming to shed more light on the pathogenesis and stimulate future research. © 2022 by the authors.

Our chemical footprint is often detected using targeted approaches, whereas xenobiotics are embedded within the large pool of dissolved metabolites, altered by biotic and abiotic mechanisms. Thus, it is necessary to simultaneously study anthropogenic signals entwined with the variety of organic signatures that exist in aquatic environments. However, methods for non-targeted analysis of natural metabolites are not always well suited for the analysis of pollutants. Here, we report the reassessment of styrene-divinylbenzene polymer-based Priority PolLutant (PPL) solid-phase extraction (PPL-SPE), which is typically used to extract marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) for biogeochemical studies, to analyze a set of xenobiotics commonly observed in coastal North Pacific seawater. After PPL extraction and analysis by nontargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS), we successfully detected 23 out of 25 selected pharmaceuticals, personal care products, biocides, perfluorocarbons, and polymer additives in a complex marine DOM sample using positive and negative electrospray ionization. We tested two pH conditions to mimic typical marine DOM extraction studies and found mean recovery rates of xenobiotics were approximately 10% higher in seawater pH (pH ~ 8) than in acidified samples (pH ~ 2) for both negative and positive modes, although overall, mean recovery rates were 10% lower in negative mode. Our results indicate that PPL-SPE in combination with non-targeted LC–MS/MS is capable of capturing the tested set of xenobiotics, thus allowing the repurposing of biogeochemical sampling strategies as well as existing DOM samples and MS data for the subsequent assessment of anthropogenic impacts in marine environments. © 2021 The Authors.

This review critically examines heavy metal and organic pollutants' role in wood treatment sites and their etiological consequences. These pollutants are not only recalcitrant but also tenacious to degradation under ordinary conditions. Although some heavy metals are essential to human health, they are toxic at elevated concentrations. Heavy metals feature carcinogenic properties and cause serious health risks to live systems and the environment because of their bio-accumulative, non-degenerative, and refractory characteristics. On the other hand, organic pollutants are readily introduced into the ecosystem from irresponsible use of detergents, volatile organic compounds, paints, pesticides, and wood preservatives. During the wood treatment process, various chemicals are used to enhance durability. Nevertheless, the use of wood preservatives such as chromated copper arsenate (CCA) and pentachlorophenol (PCP) potentially induces pollutants considered detrimental to human health and the ecological environment. Remediation of wood treatment sites using phytomanagement strategies and nanotechnologies has been presented in this review. Therefore, some challenges and recommendations for further research and applications are herein presented. © 2022, Sami Publishing Company.

Owing to its recalcitrant nature, endosulfan residues have been reported from air, water and soil causing toxicity to various non-target organisms. Microbial decontamination of endosulfan has been reported previously by several authors. In the current study, we have evaluated the pathways of endosulfan degradation and its hazardous impact on other living beings including insects, humans, plants, aquatic life and environment by in-silico methods. For establishment of the endosulfan metabolism in different ecosystems, cell designer was employed. The established model was thereafter assessed and simulated to understand the biochemical and physiological metabolism of the endosulfan in various systems of the network. Topological investigation analysis of the endosulfan metabolism validated the presence of 207 nodes and 274 edges in the network. We have concluded that biomagnification of the endosulfan generally occurs in the various elements of the ecosystem. Dynamics study of endosulfan degrading enzymes suggested the important role of monooxygenase I, II and hydrolase in endosulfan bioremediation. Endosulfan shows toxicity in human beings, fishes and plants, however it is biodegraded by the microbes. To date, there are no reports of in- silico analysis of bioremediation of endosulfan and its hazardous effects on the environment. Thus, this report can be important in terms of modelling and simulation of biodegradation network of endosulfan and similar compounds and their impact on several other systems.

In the USA, by 2020, PanCa is expected to be the second deadliest carcinogenesis. However, this cancer is usually asymptomatic in nature. Chronic pancreatitis, diabetes, and some infectious diseases are important risk factors. Besides these, acquired risk habits, such as smoking and high alcohol intake increase the chance of developing PanCa. Current meta-analysis suggests that the risk of PanCa may be increased by occupational exposures to chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, organochlorine pesticides, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), nickel (Ni), cadmium (Cd), and chromium (Cr). In the digestive system, oxidative stress is known to initiate cancer response. Mitochondrial respiration is one of the key generation machinery, and other environmental and occupational exposures/chemical reagents that induce damage to the DNA, proteins, lipids, and produce many toxic and high mutagenic metabolites that could result in tumor behavior, changing it into a malignant phenotype, and finally in cancer cell transformation. Numerous toxic, carcinogenic, and mutagenic chemical substances along with stable and unstable free radicals and reactive oxygen species (ROS), in the particulate and gas phase of tobacco smoke have the potential of biological oxidation. Several research documentations suggest that carcinogenic compounds in cigarette smoke stimulate cellular proliferation and progression of PanCa by inducing inflammation and fibrosis which results in genetic factors leading to the inhibition of cell death. It has been hypothesized that exposure to one of the occupational risk factors, Cd, a ubiquitous metal, is one of the potential cause of PanCa due to its toxic and carcinogenic properties. Evidence of involvement of Cd in PanCa development has been recently mentioned in our observational studies, meta-analyses, and experimental animal and in vitro studies. Gathering all these previous data, it is clear that oxidative stress-related responses are affected during Cd stress, but the apparent discrepancies observed in between the different research findings point towards the necessity to increase our knowledge on the spatial and temporal ROS signature under Cd stress which is present in different kinds of occupational exposures. Our present effort is to summarize findings in a systematic approach, as to how environmental and occupational risk factors induce ROS generation in PanCa, in addition to its mechanism of action, signalling cascade in the prognosis of the disease. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2022.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 0; Correspondence Address: N.

Microbial communities from anaerobic wastewater sludge, an anaerobic digester, and anaerobic dechlorinating cultures enriched from aquifer materials reductively dechlorinated 6:2 Cl-PFESA to 6:2 hydrogen-substituted polyfluorooctane ether sulfonate (6:2 H-PFESA), which was identified as the sole metabolite by non-target analysis. Rapid and complete reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was achieved by the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures. The microbial community of the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures was impacted by 6:2 Cl-PFESA exposure. Organohalide-respiring bacteria originally present in the anaerobic dechlorinating cultures, including Geobacter, Dehalobacter, and Dehalococcoides, decreased in relative abundance over time. As the relative abundance of organohalide-respiring bacteria decreased, the rates of 6:2 Cl-PFESA dechlorination decreased, suggesting that the most likely mechanism for reductive dechlorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was co-metabolism rather than organohalide respiration. Reductive defluorination of 6:2 Cl-PFESA was not observed. Furthermore, 6:2 H-PFESA exhibited 5.5 times lower sorption affinity to the suspended biosolids than 6:2 Cl-PFESA, with the prospect of increased mobility in the environment. These results show the susceptibility of 6:2 Cl-PFESA to microbially mediated reductive dechlorination and the likely persistence of the product, 6:2 H-PFESA, in anaerobic environments. © 2022 American Chemical Society","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 14; Correspondence Address: L.

PFOs are present in approximately 25% of the healthy population and are not associated with any pathology in the vast majority of cases. However, comparisons between patients with stroke and healthy controls suggest that PFOs may be causative of stroke in certain patients whose stroke is otherwise cryptogenic. Options for the diagnosis of PFO include transthoracic echocardiography, transesophageal echocardiography, and transcranial Doppler ultrasonography. PFOs associated with an interatrial septal aneurysm seem to be more strongly linked to risk of recurrent stroke. Therapeutic options for secondary stroke prevention in the setting of a PFO include antiplatelet therapy, anticoagulation, and percutaneous device closure. Recent randomized clinical trials suggest that percutaneous closure reduces the subsequent risk of stroke in appropriately selected patients, with a large relative benefit but small absolute benefit. Referral for percutaneous PFO closure should therefore be considered in certain patients after a multidisciplinary, patient centered discussion.

The over growth rate of population, industrialization, rapid urbanization, improper sanitation and use of agrochemicals might be deteriorated the water quality of Bangladesh. This study conducted one of the most comprehensive literature analyses on the current status of water quality in Bangladesh with special emphasis on both conventional pollutants (heavy metal, pesticide, fecal pollution) and emerging contaminants. Concentration of heavy metals is higher in the water bodies close to the industrial zones. Prevalence of the fecal coliform has been found in the water samples taken from almost all of the studied areas. Different pesticides from organophosphate, carbamate and organochlorine groups are found in wetlands near the irrigated land of Bangladesh. Among different emerging contaminants, the presence of antibiotic residue, fluorescence whitening agent and microplastics are recently being identified in water bodies of Bangladesh. Health risk assessment of heavy metals and pesticides residues in water were evaluated using hazard quotient (HQ) and carcinogenic risk (ILCR). The results showed that the water quality of many parts of the country is already deteriorated and significant number of populations under a potential threat of water pollution. Hence, there is an urgent need of the existence and implementation of strict laws on water quality. © 2021 The Author(s)","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 20; Correspondence Address: F.

In this review, the authors summarize key concepts for gathering and analyzing multiomics data so that neurosurgeons can contribute to the emerging field of systems neuroimmunology. Additionally, they describe 3 use cases, based on original research published by their group and others, that utilize transcriptomic, metabolomic, and proteomic analyses to study immune-signaling pathways in DDD, aSAH, and GBM. Through these use cases, techniques for performing machine learning and network-based analyses to generate new clinical insights from multiomics data are shared.

Exposure to endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) during pregnancy is associated with compromised maternal thyroid homeostasis, and thus may lead to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in newborns. However, evidence regarding the association of prenatal EDC exposure and thyroid hormones in newborns is controversial. Therefore, a meta-analysis to elucidate the relationship between maternal exposure to EDCs and neonatal THs was performed. A systematic search of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Library (CENTRAL) for relevant published studies that provided quantitative data on the association between prenatal EDC exposure and neonatal thyroid hormones was conducted in August 2021. To calculate the overall estimates, we pooled the adjusted β regression coefficients with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) from each study by the inverse variance method. The pooling results indicated that prenatal EDC exposure had no significant influence on neonatal TSH, TT3, FT3, TT4 or FT4 level in the global assessment. However, in the specific exposure and outcome assessment, we found that prenatal exposure to organochlorine (β coefficient, −0.022; 95% CI, −0.04 to −0.003) and PFAS (β coefficient, −0.017; 95% CI, −0.033 to 0) was negatively associated with neonatal TT4 level.

A minority of flat feet can hurt and limit gait. There is no optimal strategy, nor consensus, for using foot orthoses (FOs) to treat paediatric flat feet. Objectives: To assess the benefits and harms of foot orthoses for treating paediatric flat feet. Search methods: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, and Embase to 01 September 2021, and two clinical trials registers on 07 August 2020. Selection criteria: We identified all randomised controlled trials (RCTs) of FOs as an intervention for paediatric flat feet. The outcomes included in this review were pain, function, quality of life, treatment success, and adverse events. Intended comparisons were: any FOs versus sham, any FOs versus shoes, customised FOs (CFOs) versus prefabricated FOs (PFOs). Data collection and analysis: We followed standard methods recommended by Cochrane. Main results: We included 16 trials with 1058 children, aged 11 months to 19 years, with flexible flat feet. Distinct flat foot presentations included asymptomatic, juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), symptomatic and developmental co-ordination disorder (DCD). The trial interventions were FOs, footwear, foot and rehabilitative exercises, and neuromuscular electrical stimulation (NMES). Due to heterogeneity, we did not pool the data. Most trials had potential for selection, performance, detection, and selective reporting bias. No trial blinded participants. We present the results separately for asymptomatic (healthy children) and symptomatic (children with JIA) flat feet. The certainty of evidence was very low to low, downgraded for bias, imprecision, and indirectness. Three comparisons were evaluated across trials: CFO versus shoes; PFO versus shoes; CFO versus PFO. Asymptomatic flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low-quality evidence showed that CFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point visual analogue scale (VAS)) at one year (risk ratio (RR) 0.85, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.07); absolute decrease (11.8%, 95% CI 4.7% fewer to 15.8% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 1.05, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.19); absolute effect (3.4% more, 95% CI 4.1% fewer to 13.1% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 106 participants): low to very-low quality evidence showed that PFOs result in little or no difference in the proportion without pain (10-point VAS) at one year (RR 0.94, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.16); absolute effect (4.7% fewer, 95% CI 18.9% fewer to 12.6% more); or on withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.23). 3. CFOs versus PFOs (1 trial, 108 participants): low-quality evidence found no difference in the proportion without pain at one year (RR 0.93, 95% CI 0.73 to 1.18); absolute effect (7.4% fewer, 95% CI 22.2% fewer to 11.1% more); or on withdrawal due to adverse events (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.90 to 1.12). Function and quality of life (QoL) were not assessed. Symptomatic (JIA) flat feet. 1. CFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 28 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain (0 to 10 scale, 0 no pain) between groups (MD -1.5, 95% CI -2.78 to -0.22). Low-quality evidence showed improvements in function with CFOs (Foot Function Index - FFI disability, 0 to 100, 0 best function; MD -18.55, 95% CI -34.42 to -2.68), child-rated QoL (PedsQL, 0 to 100, 100 best quality; MD 12.1, 95% CI -1.6 to 25.8) and parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 9, 95% CI -4.1 to 22.1) and little or no difference between groups in treatment success (timed walking; MD -1.33 seconds, 95% CI -2.77 to 0.11), or withdrawals due to adverse events (RR 0.58, 95% CI 0.11 to 2.94); absolute difference (9.7% fewer, 20.5 % fewer to 44.8% more). 2. PFOs versus shoes (1 trial, 25 participants, 3-month follow-up): very low-quality evidence showed little or no difference in pain between groups (MD 0.02, 95% CI -1.94 to 1.98). Low-quality evidence showed no difference between groups in function (FFI-disability MD -4.17, 95% CI -24.4 to 16.06), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -3.84, 95% CI -19 to 11.33), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD -0.64, 95% CI -13.22 to 11.94). 3. CFOs versus PFsO (2 trials, 87 participants): low-quality evidence showed little or no difference between groups in pain (0 to scale, 0 no pain) at 3 months (MD -1.48, 95% CI -3.23 to 0.26), function (FFI-disability MD -7.28, 95% CI -15.47 to 0.92), child-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 8.6, 95% CI -3.9 to 21.2), or parent-rated QoL (PedsQL MD 2.9, 95% CI -11 to 16.8). Authors' conclusions: Low to very low-certainty evidence shows that the effect of CFOs (high cost) or PFOs (low cost) versus shoes, and CFOs versus PFOs on pain, function and HRQoL is uncertain. This is pertinent for clinical practice, given the economic disparity between CFOs and PFOs. FOs may improve pain and function, versus shoes in children with JIA, with minimal delineation between costly CFOs and generic PFOs. This review updates that from 2010, confirming that in the absence of pain, the use of high-cost CFOs for healthy children with flexible flat feet has no supporting evidence, and draws very limited conclusions about FOs for treating paediatric flat feet. The availability of normative and prospective foot development data, dismisses most flat foot concerns, and negates continued attention to this topic. Attention should be re-directed to relevant paediatric foot conditions, which cause pain, limit function, or reduce quality of life. The agenda for researching asymptomatic flat feet in healthy children must be relegated to history, and replaced by a targeted research rationale, addressing children with indisputable foot pathology from discrete diagnoses, namely JIA, cerebral palsy, congenital talipes equino varus, trisomy 21 and Charcot Marie Tooth. Whether research resources should continue to be wasted on studying flat feet in healthy children that do not hurt, is questionable. Future updates of this review will address only relevant paediatric foot conditions. Copyright © 2022 The Cochrane Collaboration.

Population and cross-sectional studies have demonstrated positive correlations between PFOA levels and human health problems. Objectives: Many studies have focused on the hepatotoxicity and liver problems caused by PFOA, with little attention to remediation of these problems. As an antioxidant, vitamin C is frequently utilized as a supplement for hepatic detoxification. Methods: In this study, we use a mouse model to study the possible role of vitamin C in reducing PFOA-induced liver damage. Based on comparative transcriptomic and metabolomic analysis, we elucidate the mechanisms underlying the protective effect of vitamin C. Results: Our results show that vitamin C supplementation reduces signs of PFOA-induced liver damage including total cholesterol and triglyceride levels increase, liver damage markers aspartate, transaminase, and alanine aminotransferase elevation, and liver enlargement.

Heterogeneous catalytic degradation of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-H) mediated by iron-based materials has been explored by previous researches. Yet, unknown role and degradation mechanism of tetracycline hydrochloride (TC-H) through S-nZVI driven peroxymonosulfate (PMS) need to be further investigated. In current research, the impacts of S-nZVI dosage, PMS dosage, initial pH, anions and humic acids were independently explored during TC-H degradation process. S-nZVI exhibited the high efficiency for activating PMS. TC-H degradation followed a pseudo-first order kinetics reaction with kobs at 0.1403 min−1. HA, Cl−, HPO42−, NO3− exhibited varied reduction of the reaction rates on TC-H removal. Besides, SO4•− and •OH were dedicated to degrading TC-H, and SO4•− was proved to be predominant one. The alteration of sulfide species from XPS analysis played a pivotal role in raising the electron transfer rate to improve TC-H degradation. Ten intermediates products were determined through HRMS and primary transformation mechanism involved in N-demethylation reaction, demethylation reaction, elimination reaction and hydrogenation reaction were proposed. Based on metabolomics analysis, up-regulated expression of carbohydrate metabolism, citrate cycle, CoA biosynthesis, fatty acid degradation and amino acid synthesis in Escherichia coli were significantly induced by the further products, whereas glutathione metabolism was significantly down-regulated, endorsing that potential toxicity induced by intermediates were weakened. To sum up, S-nZVI/PMS as a promising nano-water environmental remediation method could be feasible for emerging environment organic pollutants control. © 2021 Elsevier B.V.","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 16; Correspondence Address: J.

PFAS have numerous applications in the industrial and commercial fields. They have become abundant in the environment and have been detected in the blood of humans and animals. PFAS exposure likely increases the risk of certain diseases. In recent years, there has been a steep rise in related primary and secondary articles. Objectives: We aim to collate narrative and systematic reviews including both qualitative and quantitative synthesis on biological, environmental, or medical aspects of PFAS exposure and burdens, and to create an evidence review map to fulfil three main objectives. 1) Mappingto reveal what evidence on PFAS has been systematically reviewed and where synthesis may be needed. 2) Bibliometrics: to characterise the interdisciplinarity, independence and connectedness of the reviews. 3) Critical appraisal: to assess the included reviews for the reliability of conclusions and methodological transparency. This overview of reviews will inform future research and policy making. Search and study eligibility: We will perform a systematic search on Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, and the ‘grey literature’. To be included in the map, a study must be a review from the systematic review family and focus on at least one of predefined 31 PFAS. We will limit inclusions to peer-reviewed publications, pre-prints, and theses without any language restrictions. At least two authors will scan title, abstract and keywords, followed by full-text screening of included reviews. Critical appraisal of reviews and synthesis methods: We will assess each review of the systematic review family referencing the AMSTAR2 checklist. We will collect information on conflict-of-interest statements, funding sources and availability of raw data and analysis code. We will extract relevant data from full texts and bibliographic records, conduct bibliometric analyses, and display findings as tables, figures and a narrative synopsis. © 2021 The Authors","Export Date: 08 April 2024; Cited By: 5; Correspondence Address: C.

Hence, there are major incentives for developing minimally invasive methods for lead isotope analysis that are accurate and precise enough to reveal historical information about artefacts and their origin. Portable laser ablation (pLA), collecting microscopic samples on Teflon filters, has four key benefits. It produces no visual impact to the artefacts, does not require transport of artefacts to laboratory facilities, there are no artefact size restrictions, and samples are processed under clean laboratory conditions allowing Pb purification prior to measurement by solution MC-ICPMS. To validate the efficacy of the pLA technique on silver, nine matrixed-matched commercial, in-house and archaeological reference materials were sampled and analysed multiple times (9-10). The pLA mean analyses (±2SD) were all consistent with inter-laboratory bulk analyses. The digestion of sample filters produces precisions that are consistently more than five-times better than in situ nsLA-MC-ICPMS and are the same order of magnitude expected for bulk samples processed in different laboratories.

Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are persistent synthetic chemicals widely used in industry and consumer products and bioaccumulate in food webs and human tissues, such as the liver. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to conduct a systematic review of the literature and meta-analysis evaluating PFAS exposure and evidence of liver injury from rodent and epidemiological studies. METHODS: PubMed and Embase were searched for all studies from earliest available indexing year through 1 December 2021 using keywords corresponding to PFAS exposure and liver injury. For data synthesis, results were limited to studies in humans and rodents assessing the following indicators of liver injury: serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or steatosis. For human studies, at least three observational studies per PFAS were used to conduct a weighted z-score meta-analysis to determine the direction and significance of associations. For rodent studies, data were synthesized to qualitatively summarize the direction and significance of effect. RESULTS: Our search yielded 85 rodent studies and 24 epidemiological studies, primarily of people from the United States. Studies focused primarily on legacy PFAS: perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS), perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA), and perfluorohexanesulfonic acid. Meta-analyses of human studies revealed that higher ALT levels were associated with exposure to PFOA (z-score =  6.20, p < 0.001), PFOS (z-score =  3.55, p < 0.001), and PFNA (z-score =  2.27, p = 0.023). PFOA exposure was also associated with higher aspartate aminotransferase and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels in humans. In rodents, PFAS exposures consistently resulted in higher ALT levels and steatosis. CONCLUSION: There is consistent evidence for PFAS hepatotoxicity from rodent studies, supported by associations of PFAS and markers of liver function in observational human studies. This review identifies a need for additional research evaluating next-generation PFAS, mixtures, and early life exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10092.",,10.1289/EHP10092,Biomarkers;*Environmental Pollutants;*Fluorocarbons;Humans;*Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease;United States,35475652,PMC9044977,exposure to per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and markers of liver injury a systematic review and metaanalysis

However, the regional and temporal differences, in addition to the predictors of therapy failure, are unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to conduct a systematic review of the prevalence of treatment failure in patients with scabies and investigation of associated factors. METHODS: We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, Web of Science, Scopus, Global Health and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from inception to August 2021 for randomized and quasi-randomized trials, in addition to observational studies that enrolled children or adults diagnosed with confirmed or clinical scabies treated with permethrin, ivermectin, crotamiton, benzyl benzoate, malathion, sulfur or lindane, and measured treatment failure or factors associated with treatment failure. We performed a random effects meta-analysis for all outcomes reported by at least two studies. RESULTS: A total of 147 studies were eligible for inclusion in the systematic review. The overall prevalence of treatment failure was 15.2% [95% confidence interval (CI) 12.9-17.6; I2 = 95.3%, moderate-certainty evidence] with regional differences between World Health Organization regions (P = 0.003) being highest in the Western Pacific region (26.9%, 95% CI 14.5-41.2). Oral ivermectin (11.8%, 95% CI 8.4-15.4), topical ivermectin (9.3%, 95% CI 5.1-14.3) and permethrin (10.8%, 95% CI 7.5-14.5) had relatively lower failure prevalence compared with the overall prevalence. Failure prevalence was lower in patients treated with two doses of oral ivermectin (7.1%, 95% CI 3.1-12.3) compared with those treated with one dose (15.2%, 95% CI 10.8-20.2; P = 0.021). Overall and permethrin treatment failure prevalence in the included studies (1983-2021) increased by 0.27% and 0.58% per year, respectively. Only three studies conducted a multivariable risk factor analysis; no studies assessed resistance. CONCLUSIONS: A second dose of ivermectin showed lower failure prevalence than single-dose ivermectin, which should be considered in all guidelines. The increase in treatment failure over time hints at decreasing mite susceptibility for several drugs, but reasons for failure are rarely assessed. Ideally, scabicide susceptibility testing should be implemented in future studies.",,10.1093/bjd/ljad308,"Adult;Child;Humans;*Scabies/drug therapy;Ivermectin;Permethrin/therapeutic use;Hexachlorocyclohexane/therapeutic use;Malathion/therapeutic use;Administration, Oral",37625798,,failure of scabies treatment a systematic review and metaanalysis

However, the impact of PFAS on cardiovascular diseases remains controversial. This meta-analysis aimed to analyze the impact of PFAS on the stroke risk. CONTENT: Databases were searched for studies published up to November 1, 2022, which report the association between stroke and exposure to at least one of four main PFAS (perfluorooctanoic acid [PFOA], perfluorooctanesulfonic acid [PFOS], perfluorononanoic acid [PFNA], and perfluorohexane sulfonic acid [PFHxS]). Data extraction and quality assessment were performed according to the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. SUMMARY AND OUTLOOK: Four studies were included in this systematic review. Multivariate adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for incident stroke per 1-log unit increment in each serum PFAS were combined in the meta-analysis. The risk of development of stroke was not significantly associated with PFOA, PFOS, or PFNA exposure (PFOA: pooled odds ratio [OR]=1.001, 95 % confidence interval [CI]=0.975-1.028, p=0.934; PFOS: pooled OR=0.994, 95 % CI=0.972-1.017, p=0.601; PFNA: pooled OR=1.016, 95 % CI=0.920-1.123, p=0.752), whereas a moderately lower risk was associated with PFHxS exposure without statistical significance (pooled OR=0.953, 95 % CI=0.908-1.001, p=0.054). PFOA, PFOS, and PFNA exposure showed a neutral association, while PFHxS showed a possible inverse association with the risk of stroke. Therefore, this finding should be interpreted with caution. Further prospective observational studies with PFAS mixture analyses are warranted.",,10.1515/reveh-2023-0021,,37656598,,exposure to perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances and risk of stroke in adults a metaanalysis

Thousands of distinct PFAS exist in commerce. The 2019 U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (U.S. EPA) Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) Action Plan outlines a multiprogram national research plan to address the challenge of PFAS. One component of this strategy involves the use of systematic evidence map (SEM) approaches to characterize the evidence base for hundreds of PFAS. OBJECTIVE: SEM methods were used to summarize available epidemiological and animal bioassay evidence for a set of  ∼ 150 PFAS that were prioritized in 2019 by the U.S. EPA's Center for Computational Toxicology and Exposure (CCTE) for in vitro toxicity and toxicokinetic assay testing. METHODS: Systematic review methods were used to identify and screen literature using manual review and machine-learning software. The Populations, Exposures, Comparators, and Outcomes (PECO) criteria were kept broad to identify mammalian animal bioassay and epidemiological studies that could inform human hazard identification. A variety of supplemental content was also tracked, including information on in vitro model systems; exposure measurement-only studies in humans; and absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME). Animal bioassay and epidemiology studies meeting PECO criteria were summarized with respect to study design, and health system(s) were assessed. Because animal bioassay studies with  ≥ 21-d exposure duration (or reproductive/developmental study design) were most useful to CCTE analyses, these studies underwent study evaluation and detailed data extraction. All data extraction is publicly available online as interactive visuals with downloadable metadata. RESULTS: More than 40,000 studies were identified from scientific databases. Screening processes identified 44 animal and 148 epidemiology studies from the peer-reviewed literature and 95 animal and 50 epidemiology studies from gray literature that met PECO criteria. Epidemiological evidence (available for 15 PFAS) mostly assessed the reproductive, endocrine, developmental, metabolic, cardiovascular, and immune systems. Animal evidence (available for 40 PFAS) commonly assessed effects in the reproductive, developmental, urinary, immunological, and hepatic systems. Overall, 45 PFAS had evidence across animal and epidemiology data streams. DISCUSSION: Many of the  ∼ 150 PFAS were data poor. Epidemiological and animal evidence were lacking for most of the PFAS included in our search. By disseminating this information, we hope to facilitate additional assessment work by providing the initial scoping literature survey and identifying key research needs. Future research on data-poor PFAS will help support a more complete understanding of the potential health effects from PFAS exposures. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP10343.",,10.1289/EHP10343,"Animals;Databases, Factual;Epidemiologic Studies;*Fluorocarbons/analysis;Humans;Mammals;Reproduction;United States;United States Environmental Protection Agency",35580034,PMC9113544,systematic evidence map for over one hundred and fifty per and polyfluoroalkyl substances pfas

We measured twelve PFAS in serum and 50 plasma bioactive lipids (parent fatty acids and eicosanoids derived from cytochrome p450, lipoxygenase, and cyclooxygenase) during pregnancy (median 17 gestational weeks). Pairwise associations across cohorts were estimated using linear mixed models and meta-analysis. Associations between the PFAS mixture and individual bioactive lipids were estimated using quantile g-computation. RESULTS: PFDeA, PFOA, and PFUdA were associated (p<0.05) with changes in bioactive lipid levels in all three enzymatic pathways (cyclooxygenase [n=6 signatures]; cytochrome p450 [n=5 signatures]; lipoxygenase [n=7 signatures]) in at least one combined cohort analysis. The strongest signature indicated that a doubling in PFOA corresponded with a 24.3% increase (95% CI [7.3%, 43.9%]) in PGD2 (cyclooxygenase pathway) in the combined cohort. In the mixtures analysis, we observed nine positive signals across all pathways associated with the PFAS mixture. The strongest signature indicated that a quartile increase in the PFAS mixture was associated with a 34% increase in PGD2 (95% CI [8%, 66%]), with PFOS contributing most to the increase. CONCLUSIONS: Bioactive lipids were revealed as biomarkers of PFAS exposure and could provide mechanistic insights into PFAS' influence on pregnancy outcomes, informing more precise risk estimation and prevention strategies.",,10.1101/2023.11.03.23297930,,37961525,PMC10635258,crosssectional associations between prenatal maternal per and polyfluoroalkyl substances and bioactive lipids in three environmental influences on child health outcomes echo cohorts

While some pollutants are well studied, there are little or no data on the potential health effects for many thousands of chemicals that can make their way into the environment, such as PFAS. EPA still relies on laboratory mammalian studies as the foundation of most human health risk assessments, which are limited by high costs, long timelines, and other concerns. New approach methods (NAMs) in toxicology, for example new in vivo and in vitro strategies and computational systems biology, offer opportunities to inform timely decision-making when no data are available from laboratory mammalian toxicity tests or epidemiological studies. NAMs may also help inform efforts to protect susceptible and vulnerable populations by characterizing subtle health perturbations, better encompassing genetic diversity, and accounting for nonchemical stressors. While the promise and need for NAMs is clear, many barriers to their use remain. This report aims to bridge the gap between the potential of NAMs and their practical application in human health risk assessment. Building Confidence in New Evidence Streams for Human Health Risk Assessment draws lessons learned from laboratory mammalian toxicity tests to help inform approaches for building scientific confidence in NAMs and for incorporating such data into risk assessment and decision-making. Overall, the report recommendations aim to ensure a seamless handoff from the evaluation of NAM-based testing strategies in the laboratory to the incorporation of NAM data into modern, systematic-review-based risk assessments.",,10.17226/26906,,37579039,,

OBJECTIVES: The aims of the study were to (1) characterize the landscape of PFD disparities literature using the 3 phases of disparities research framework, (2) describe the characteristics of PFD disparities studies, and (3) identify critical knowledge gaps. STUDY DESIGN: We performed a systematic review of peer-reviewed publications addressing disparities in PFDs among U.S. populations from PubMed, Embase, Scopus, or the Cochrane Database indexed between 1997 and 2022. Using the triphasic framework for advancing health disparities research by Kilbourne et al (Am J Public Health. 2006;96(12):2113-21), we categorized the included studies into the detecting phase (identifies and measures disparities in historically marginalized populations), understanding phase (establishes disparity determinants), or reducing phase (conducts interventions to alleviate inequities). All screening, coding, and quality reviews were independently performed by at least 2 authors. We used descriptive analysis and the χ2 test for comparisons. RESULTS: The initial search identified 10,178 studies, of which 123 were included. Of the included studies, 98 (79.7%), 22 (17.9%), and 3 (2.4%) studies were detecting, understanding, and reducing phase research, respectively. The most common disparity category investigated was race and ethnicity (104 studies), and one third of these studies attributed drivers of racial and ethnic differences to structural influences. Publications of detecting phase studies outpaced the growth of understanding and reducing phase research.

Primary teeth are an emerging biomatrix, which aid in storing crucial data on early exposure to harmful substances and developmental illnesses. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the association between environmental chemical exposure and health outcomes in children and adolescents using primary teeth as a matrix. The study protocol was registered with PROSPERO (CRD42023428013). The review spanned studies published between 1974 and 2023, identified through an extensive literature search on databases like MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, CINAHL, the Cochrane Oral Health Group Specialized Register, Scopus, and Web of Science. Distiller SR software was used to assess study quality and extract the outcome data. The NTP-OHAT scale assessed evidence quality, and case-control, cross-sectional, and cohort studies in English were included. Comprehensively reviewing 5287 articles resulted in 29 studies being included in the final analysis, comprising 15 cross-sectional, seven case-control, and seven cohort studies. All 29 studies qualified for qualitative analysis. Eleven studies analyzed lead (Pb) effects on health outcomes, four analyzed manganese (Mn), and 14 investigated other element groups. Primary teeth biomatrix assessed various health outcomes: neurobehavior, childhood behaviour, ADHD, birth outcomes, fetal alcohol syndrome disease, inflammatory bowel disease, and dental caries. This study contributes to existing evidence, reinforcing a link between environmental metal exposure and health consequences. The evidence extends to prenatal and postnatal periods, substantiated by primary teeth biomatrix analysis.

It is important to identify conditions that may exacerbate oral disease to aid public health and policy development and promote targeted patient treatment strategies. Developmental defects can increase an individual's risk of dental caries, hypersensitivity, premature tooth wear, erosion, and poor aesthetics. As part of an ongoing study assessing oral health in adults with cystic fibrosis at Cork University Dental School and Hospital, a systematic review of available literature was conducted to assess the prevalence of enamel defects in people with cystic fibrosis. AIMS: To critically evaluate the literature to determine if the prevalence of developmental defects of enamel is higher in people with cystic fibrosis (PwCF). METHODS: Data Sources: Three online databases were searched Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science Core Collection. Studies that examined an association between cystic fibrosis and developmental defects of enamel were included in this systematic review. RESULTS: The initial search identified 116 publications from the following databases Embase, Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus. Eleven studies were included for qualitative analysis. Nine studies concluded that PwCF had a higher prevalence of enamel defects than control people and one study found no difference in cystic fibrosis (CF) status. All studies had a risk of bias that may influence study results and their interpretation. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the systematic review show a consistent pattern that PwCF have a higher prevalence of DDE than people without CF.

Although of great importance to soil biogeochemical processes, how plastics influence soil microbes have yet to be systematically studied. The primary objectives of this study are to evaluate whether plastics lead to divergent responses of soil microbial community parameters, and explore the potential driving factors. METHODS: We performed a meta-analysis of 710 paired observations from 48 published articles to quantify the impact of plastic on the diversity, biomass, and functionality of soil microbial communities. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: This study indicated that plastics accelerated soil organic carbon loss (effect size = -0.05, p = 0.004) and increased microbial functionality (effect size = 0.04, p = 0.003), but also reduced microbial biomass (effect size = -0.07, p < 0.001) and the stability of co-occurrence networks. Polyethylene significantly reduced microbial richness (effect size = -0.07, p < 0.001) while polypropylene significantly increased it (effect size = 0.17, p < 0.001). Degradable plastics always had an insignificant effect on the microbial community. The effect of the plastic amount on microbial functionality followed the ""hormetic dose-response"" model, the infection point was about 40 g/kg. Approximately 3564.78 μm was the size of the plastic at which the response of microbial functionality changed from positive to negative. Changes in soil pH, soil organic carbon, and total nitrogen were significantly positively correlated with soil microbial functionality, biomass, and richness (R(2) = 0.04-0.73, p < 0.05). The changes in microbial diversity were decoupled from microbial community structure and functionality. We emphasize the negative impacts of plastics on soil microbial communities such as microbial abundance, essential to reducing the risk of ecological surprise in terrestrial ecosystems. Our comprehensive assessment of plastics on soil microbial community parameters deepens the understanding of environmental impacts and ecological risks from this emerging pollution.",,10.3389/fmicb.2023.1258606,,37901816,PMC10601715,soil microbial community parameters affected by microplastics and other plastic residues

The identification of EDs require a substantial amount of data, both in vitro and in vivo, due to the current scientific criteria in the EU. At the same time, the EU strives to reduce animal testing due to concerns regarding animal welfare and sensitivity of animal studies to adequately detect adverse effects relevant for human health. Perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) is a persistent organic pollutant that is suspected to be an ED based on academic research, however it is not identified as such from a regulatory perspective. It has previously been shown that PFOS has the potential to cause neurotoxicity as well as affect the thyroid system, and it is known that specific thyroid hormone levels are critical in the development of the brain during. In this work, the aim was to evaluate a mechanism-based approach to identify ED properties of PFOS based on the Adverse Outcome Pathway (AOP) framework and using New Approach Methods (NAMs), by comparing this approach to an ED assessment based on the currently available guidance document. An AOP network (AOPN) was generated for the thyroid modality, and AOPs leading to developmental neurotoxicity (DNT) were identified. A literature search and screening process based on the AOPN, and systematic review methodology, was performed, followed by a rigorous Weight-of-Evidence (WoE) assessment. Evidence was mapped back onto the AOPN used for the literature search, to identify possible endocrine Modes-of-Action (MoAs) for PFOS and data gaps in the two assessments. It could be concluded that PFOS fulfils the criteria for ED classification in the standard ED assessment, but not in the mechanism-based assessment. The need for quantitative information, such as quantitative AOPs, for the mechanism-based approach is discussed. The possibility of a directly neurotoxic alternative MoA was also highlighted based on available in vitro data. Opportunities and challenges with implementing AOPs and NAMs into the regulatory assessment of EDs, and assessing hazard in the Next Generation Risk Assessment, is discussed. This case study exploring the mechanism-based approach to ED identification represents an important step toward more accurate and predictive assessment of EDs based on AOPs and NAMs, and to the Next Generation Risk Assessment (NGRA) concept.",,10.1016/j.tox.2024.153794,,38580097,,exploring a mechanismbased approach for the identification of endocrine disruptors using adverse outcome pathways aops and new approach methodologies nams a perfluorooctane sulfonic acid case study

Over 1400 research articles have been published, predominantly praising the advantages of this test. METHODS: The present study identified among the 1400 papers 24 original and one review paper, which were suited to re-evaluate the efficacy of > 750,000 published NIPT-results. Special attention was given to false-positive and false-negative result-rates. Those were discussed under different aspects-mainly from a patient-perspective. RESULTS: A 27: 1 rate of false-positive compared to false-negative NIPT results was found. Besides, according to all reported, real-positive, chromosomally aberrant NIPT cases, 90% of those would have been aborted spontaneously before birth. These findings are here discussed under aspects like (i) How efficient is NIPT compared to first trimester screening? (ii) What are the differences in expectations towards NIPT from specialists and the public? and (iii) There should also be children born suffering from not by NIPT tested chromosomal aberrations; why are those never reported in all available NIPT studies? CONCLUSIONS: Even though much research has been published on NIPT, unbiased figures concerning NIPT and first trimester screening efficacy are yet not available. While false positive rates of different NIPT tests maybe halfway accurate, reported false-negative rates are most likely too low. The latter is as NIPT-cases with negative results for tested conditions are yet not in detail followed up for cases with other genetic or teratogenic caused disorders. This promotes an image in public, that NIPT is suited to replace all invasive tests, and also to solve the problem of inborn errors in humans, if not now then in near future. Overall, it is worth discussing the usefulness of NIPT in practical clinical application. Particularly, asking for unbiased figures concerning the efficacy of first trimester-screening compared to NIPT, and for really comprehensive data on false-positive and false-negative NIPT results.",,10.1186/s13039-022-00612-2,,35986330,PMC9392255,falsepositives and falsenegatives in noninvasive prenatal testing nipt what can we learn from a metaanalyses on > 750000 tests
